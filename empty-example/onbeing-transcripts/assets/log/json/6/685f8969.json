  "fullText": "Let\u2019s say somebody said that they had a belief system in which it was simply posited that carbon came out of, I don\u2019t know, a blue sky one day. That wouldn\u2019t make me feel any more meaning about who I was in the world. It feels much richer to me to imagine that a cold, empty cosmos collapses with stars, and stars burn and shine, and they make carbon in their cores and then they throw them out again. And that carbon collects and forms another planet and another star and then amino acids evolve and then human beings arise. I mean, that\u2019s, to me, a really beautiful narrative. Janna Levin is a theoretical physicist who studies the shape of the universe, and whether it is finite or infinite. And she\u2019s a physicist who\u2019s also explored her science by way of a novel of ideas. Her novel, A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines , centers on the lives and ideas of two pivotal 20th-century mathematicians, Kurt G\u00F6del and Alan Turing. Turing is known as the father of modern computing. G\u00F6del shook the worlds of mathematics, philosophy, and logic showing that some mathematical truths can never be proven. Both pushed at boundaries where mathematics presses on grand questions of meaning and purpose. Such questions helped create the technologies that are now changing our sense of what it means to be human. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Janna Levin is a professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College. I interviewed her in 2007 after the release of her novel. Many people talk about childhood as a time when we all start to ask for the first time we ask these great existential questions, like how did this all happen? How did we get here? I wonder as you look back to your childhood, can you trace your curiosity in a rudimentary form to some of the things that fascinate you now? Oh, absolutely, I remember asking questions like that, about the origin of the universe, and what we were doing here and what it meant to be a part of the cosmos. I didn\u2019t think I would go on to be a scientist, in fact I started as a philosophy major in college. I was very negative about physics especially, I had no physics experience whatsoever, but I had this kinda comical stereotype of physicists memorizing things and being kinda rote. And I thought philosophy was after the big questions. And It\u2019s very ironic, when I look back at my childhood, that I was absolutely mesmerized by cosmology and astronomy, even evolutionary science, ideas of natural selection. They had always captured my imagination, and with these gratifying sort of ways to think about the world. Even if I didn\u2019t always understand the answers, it was sort of really a way to think about the world. Was there science being discussed in your home? Yeah my father is an MD and he for a few years was doing research science, medical research. And he always talked a lot about sort of scientific explanations for things. You couldn\u2019t, you know, say you smelt something without it being a discussion about the molecules and and the neurons firing and how neurons worked. So it was kind of a natural way to talk in the house. Although again I didn\u2019t over analyze that as a child. My mother was very literary and read lots of books and was not at all scientifically inclined. So I didn\u2019t sense that my house had a sort of predominantly science approach. Was there a religious background in the house? No. No, ok. Um in a sense. I shouldn\u2019t say no. My grandparents were immigrants, Jewish immigrants from Europe, and Eastern Europe. And they grew up with a strong religious tradition. And my parents grew up speaking yiddish and my grandparents kept kosher until later in their lives when they kind of gave that up. So there was a sense of tradition. A very strong sense tradition and a very strong sense of our European history and our Jewish history. But I myself was never brought to temple and I didn\u2019t have a bar mitzvah and I didn\u2019t practice Judaism actually, I would have to say. And, I mean, tell me how you made that transition when you went to college and you were studying philosophy. How did you get captured by theoretical physics? I think I hadn\u2019t really admitted to myself that I actually loved science. And then I was in a philosophy class, and I was sort of impressed with the subject. We were talking about a lot of interesting things, free will, indeterminism, what it means to say we\u2019re free in a world that\u2019s completely, causally, physically determined. And there are all these very deep questions. And one day, a scientist came in to give a guest lecture, and they started to discuss something about quantum mechanics. And everybody in the room got very quiet. And they discussed things about Einstein. Right. And what I was most impressed with is that philosophers didn\u2019t know how to respond. So I thought it was powerful. And I became interested in physics. And I think that this book you\u2019ve written about Kurt G\u00F6del and Alan Turing takes place very much at that intersection where philosophical questions meet scientific inquiry and scientific truth. Mm-hmm. I think it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, I definitely came back \u2019round again. Did you? Yeah. I mean, in some sense, I came full circle again to start asking those philosophical questions, I think. I mean, because this kind of \u2014 this basic question, I mean, let\u2019s start with Kurt G\u00F6del, about truth, right? And I want you to put this into your own words, because I can\u2019t say that I can completely wrap my mind around it, but I\u2019m utterly intrigued with it. You know, that truth would ultimately elude us. That some mathematical truths can\u2019t be proven within the realm of mathematics, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re not true \u2026 Yes, that\u2019s right. Yeah. \u2026 but that mathematics itself can\u2019t demonstrate their truth. Yeah, that\u2019s right. It was a time in history when most mathematicians, I think it would be fair to say, believed that mathematics could address every mathematical proposition. And that\u2019s a fair enough thing to believe in retrospect. Why shouldn\u2019t mathematics be able to prove every true mathematical fact? So when G\u00F6del came along and he found a very surreal kind of tangle, a mathematical proposition that makes a peculiar claim about itself, which cannot be proven within the context of arithmetic \u2014 it was in the context of arithmetic that he did this \u2014 it really shocked people. It really shook them up. And I think the way he said it is actually the clearest and nicest way to say it. \u201CThere are some truths that can never be proven to be true.\u201D And it opens up this idea \u2014 which terrified people \u2014 that there are limits to what we can ever know. And it\u2019s not the first time it happened. If you think about Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, it was a similar idea. There are limits to how fast we can ever travel. We are limited by the speed of light. There are limits in quantum mechanics to how much we can ever really know. There are fundamental limits to certainty. And this all sort of happened around the same period of time that we began to accept this. You have a lot of scenes with G\u00F6del in Vienna, early 1930s Vienna, in a coffeehouse, in a famous kind of intellectual gathering which was called the Vienna Circle. And there\u2019s a scene where you have \u2014 there\u2019s this mathematician, Olga Hahn-Neurath, and her husband Otto, who\u2019s a socialist and \u2014 I mean, these are just some of the people. Moritz Schlick was a philosopher and a logician who kind of headed this. And they often just come back to a Wittgenstein\u2019s premise \u2014 his first premise in his famous Tractatus \u2014 that \u201Cthe world is all that is the case,\u201D which is a statement about a basic thing that we can know as real. \u2018It is a fair question,\u2019 he confesses. \u2018How do I verify a fact of the world?\u2019 Such a simple question. \u201CBeing honest, he can be sure only he sees. He can be sure only he touches. He watches Olga pull on a mammoth cigar. She has a calm about her, always at ease. The smoke drifts in curly plumes, sifting through her lashes. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind and even tends to hold the burning cinder vertically and uncomfortably close to her eyes. \u201CBut what really arrests Moritz, what keeps his fingers in a frozen clutch around the cup, coffee suspended near his chin, is this question: Does Olga exist? He hangs there for what seems like a very long while. The conversation stalls, suspended along with the coffee. \u201C\u2018Olga?\u2019 \u201C\u2018Yes, Moritz, I\u2019m here.\u2019 \u201CShe reaches over and hooks his thumb with her forefinger. The rest of her fingers scramble over to clasp his hand, but all Moritz concedes is that he can feel what he has learned to describe as pressure on what he believes to be his hand.\u2019 In the story, in the novel, all the members of the circle who were sitting at the table with him start to question almost whether they themselves are real, whether the person who\u2019s sitting across the table from them is real. And as a reader, I had that same experience. And \u2026 That\u2019s beautiful, yeah. It\u2019s wonderful. And so, I mean, I wonder if you would kind of describe that scene the way you envisioned it and what\u2019s happening there for you? Well, I really hoped that the reader would have that experience, because ultimately I think that\u2019s where the book nudges. Do you know that any of this is real, that the book isn\u2019t a figment of your imagination somehow? Even the book itself, right? The book itself. That somehow you aren\u2019t the author of the book itself. Right. And so I was definitely pushing on that limit of what do we know and what don\u2019t we know, what do we take to be faith, what\u2019s rational to believe, what\u2019s not rational to believe. And what is it that he says, \u201CAnd how is it that is so shattering to them and to us?\u201D Mm-hmm. Well it\u2019s interesting there\u2019s a little twist there which is that G\u00F6del, even though he proved something which is absolutely correct about mathematics, had beliefs which most people do not take to be true. Right. Right. And struggle with. So his mathematics is confirmed and everyone agrees is tremendous. And yet when we look at his ideas about the transmigration of the soul and his ideas about external reality being questionable, he really was suspicious about an external reality. The only reality he trusted was the mathematical reality he could kind of probe logically with his mind. Numbers were more real than possibly the person sitting across the table from him. That\u2019s right. He believed numbers were more convincingly real than the idea that the sun was real when you couldn\u2019t see it anymore after it had set. So his idea about an empirical reality was strange. He wasn\u2019t sure he could believe in it. And most people I think aren\u2019t struggling with those issues and so find it hard to follow G\u00F6del down that path. And yet his mathematics was absolutely sound and shattering. And I think at some stage, I realized that what I was writing about wasn\u2019t so much mathematics. What I was really writing about, which I think you\u2019ve struck on, is belief. What G\u00F6del believed, what the people in the Vienna Circle believed, how they all ultimately struggled with different ideas about reality. And there is this sort of surreal vagueness to our conclusions. You know, you write of both G\u00F6del and Turing, that they were besotted with mathematics. And I have to say that I feel that you, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re completely like them in that way, but you have a real sympathy for that. You know the way you seem to delight and just in the way they live with mathematics and wrestle with it. And is that true? I mean, for you, are numbers maybe not more real than the Sun and the Earth, but as real as the Sun and the Earth? And, you know, if so what does, what does that mean exactly? How would you explain that? Well, I would absolutely say I am also besotted with mathematics. I don\u2019t worry about what\u2019s real and not real in the way that maybe G\u00F6del did. I think what Turing did, which was so beautiful, was to have a very practical approach. He believed that life was sort of, in a way, simple. And you could relate to mathematics in a concrete and practical way. And it wasn\u2019t all about surreal, abstract theories. And that\u2019s why Turing is the one who invents the computer, because he thinks so practically. He can imagine a machine which adds and subtracts, a machine which performs the mathematical operations that the mind performs. And the modern computers that we have now are these very practical machines that are built on those ideas. And so I would say that, like Turing, I am absolutely struck with the power of mathematics, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a theoretical physicist. If I want to answer questions, I love that we can all share the mathematical answers. It\u2019s not about me trying to convince you of what I believe or of my perspective. We can all agree that one plus one is two, and we can all make calculations that come out to be the same, whether you\u2019re from India or Pakistan or, you know, Oklahoma \u2026 Right. \u2026 we all have that in common. And so there\u2019s something about that that\u2019s deeply moving to me and that makes mathematics pure and special, and yet I\u2019m able to have a more practical attitude about it, which is that, well, we can build machines this way. And there is a physical reality that we can relate to using mathematics. But Turing also, in his own way, explored the limits of our ability to know and prove what is true. Didn\u2019t he? I mean is that a fair statement? He did\u2014Yes, he went beyond G\u00F6del even and realized that in a sense, most numbers aren\u2019t numbers about which we can know anything. And that seems very confusing. It seems like we know a lot of numbers: One, two, three, four, five. Right. It seems like we know infinite lists of numbers. What Turing showed is that there are numbers which are so long that if I imagined them as a decimal point with a list of digits. That that list of digits is infinite and essentially random. And there are numbers about which we will never know anything. And it leads to very strange things which even sometimes I think about in my own research, which is are those numbers real in any sense, or are they just a mathematical construction. Is there no physical object which will ever be described by what he called an uncomputable number. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today a conversation about: \u201CMathematics, Purpose, and Truth,\u201D with physicist and novelist Janna Levin. I was very interested also that you wrote that Turing is known as the father of modern computing. And yet of course many people and developments played into that, into what we have today. You wrote though that he wanted to design machines that could think. And for him even in that very early stage he wasn\u2019t just talking about computers that would have knowledge programmed in that would be able to play chess. Which is in fact the way the field of artificial intelligence really began in many ways, really was for a few decades. But he actually had the vision towards which a lot of artificial intelligence, I know at MIT is moving, which is what we want to do is create computers that can think, that can learn the way humans beings learn. I wonder if you had any thoughts about that contradiction and what he believed and the way the field developed? Well there is a really interesting point which can be found, in a way, in their discoveries. If you think of mathematics as a rigid system where you have some rules and you start at some starting point and you always follow those rules to generate theorems, thats is essentially what a formal mathematical system is. And if you can prove that there are true facts that can never be reached by such a formal process, then any computer that you program in that way, by just teaching it a handful of rules, it will only be able to do a certain limited number of things. It can never prove these kinds of unprovable statements\u2014fine. But the difference between the human mind is I can recognize the truth of a statement even if I can\u2019t prove it. And that is something that I can\u2019t do if I only program a rigid system to follow rigid rules. And so our minds seem to be doing something that\u2019s different than what a formal mathematical system does. And so it\u2019s very rooted in their theories the things that both G\u00F6del and Turing proved that if I only program a computer in this way I can never get it to do the things that a mind can do and they knew that. I think G\u00F6del said that he imagined an artificial intelligence evolving, not so much being programmed. I think one of the interesting ideas in artificial intelligence is to try and do something similarly. Start a digital organism, so to speak, in a digital ecology and see if you can\u2019t evolve an intelligence. And it is true, I think you mentioned, that G\u00F6del believed in the transmigration of souls but Turing by contrast lost a faith that he did have early in life and he really came to think of us as human beings as kind of biological machines. Yeah I think that was a very important moment for Turing and I tried to describe it very sympathetically. I think there is a lot of feeling that if someone loses their religious faith that it would be this dark and horrible moment. It could only be associated with a kind of tragedy or despair. And I wanted to explain his, describe his, as being a beautiful moment for him. Because he had been grappling with such inconsistency between his logical naturalist approach to the world which was verifiable, which he really did deeply relate to, which was everything to him. And his religious disposition which wasn\u2019t jelling with the former, with this naturalist approach. And he just couldn\u2019t get them together. And I think there was a constant rub and feeling of discomfort and struggle with it and when he accepted a more materialist approach in the sense of there is just nature, there is just mathematics. There is just this sort of organic reality that he became freer and happier and his life became easier. And it was a beautiful moment for him. Right. And you know initially you mentioned the word beauty and I have to say that something that\u2019s always fascinated me in conversation with scientist and I\u2019m thinking of George Ellis the cosmologist as one example. Where I really can hear his voice again, \u201CThe beauty of a mathematical equation.\u201D It\u2019s funny I think scientist are the last ones to get away with talking about beauty. I don\u2019t think artist with a straight face can really talk about beauty anymore, it\u2019s not chic. Right. And not even writers can talk about beauty it seems corny. And so only scientist with a straight face can talk about things being beautiful being seriously motivated by aesthetics and having it actually pan out. I mean that\u2019s quite remarkable. People have literally pursued theories because there more beautiful and more elegant and they make predictions that are later verified in experiments. So it\u2019s a fascinating question, why is beauty an actually good way of devising our ideas about the universe? Why are they confirmed by nature? Why does nature choose beautiful ways of unraveling? And I mean just echoing what we were speaking about earlier on about truth and getting back to G\u00F6del and Turning. I remember someone saying to me and maybe it was George Ellis maybe it was John Polkinghorne the physicist saying, \u201CIf an equation is not elegant and beautiful it is likely not true.\u201D That does seem to be the case. I mean you could say we can\u2019t recognize things that aren\u2019t beautiful but it\u2019s really deeper than that. It\u2019s really deeper than saying oh I only picked out the pattern. You can imagine the particles of the universe falling into a symmetric pattern as one particle physicist did and one was missing from this beautiful symmetric arrangement and he conjectured the existence of that particle and lo and behold it was confirmed. So it\u2019s really something more than saying we can only pull out the pattern and we miss everything else. So I want to pose a question to you that you pose in different ways to Turing and G\u00F6del, or you have them contemplate in the novel. And I\u2019ll say it this way, you know: In your mind, does the fact that one plus one equals two have anything to do with God? Are you asking me that question? Yeah, I\u2019m asking you that question. I\u2019m asking you how you think about that. I think it\u2019s \u2014 I am \u2014 oh, you\u2019re tough. I think that it raises \u2014 if I were to ever lean towards spiritual thinking or religious thinking, it would be in that way. It would be, why is it that there is this abstract mathematics that guides the universe? The universe is remarkable, because we can understand it. That\u2019s what\u2019s remarkable. All the other things are remarkable, too. It\u2019s really, really astounding that these little creatures on this little planet that seem totally insignificant in the middle of nowhere \u2014 we\u2019re not special, we\u2019re not in a special place \u2014 can look back over the 14-billion year history of the universe and understand so much and in such a short time. So I think that that is where I would get a sense, again, of meaning and of purpose and of beauty and of being integrated with the universe so that it doesn\u2019t feel hopeless and meaningless. Now, I don\u2019t personally invoke a God to do that, but I can\u2019t say that mathematics would disprove the existence of God either. And it\u2019s just one of those things where over and over again, you come to that point where some people will make that leap and say, \u2018I believe that God initiated this and then stepped away, and the rest was this beautiful mathematical unfolding.\u2019 And others will say, \u2018Well, as far back as it goes, it seems to be these mathematical structures. And I don\u2019t feel the need to conjure up any other entity.\u2019 Right. And I think I fall into that camp, and without feeling, again, despair or dissatisfaction and yet I understand why other people make the other jump. We tend to think time is like a straight arrow, always moving forward. But Einstein called that a stubbornly persistent illusion. And Janna Levin\u2019s novel, A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines , is structured to evoke time the way physicists know it \u2014 as relative and curved, with past, present, and future in a fluid interplay. She occasionally brings herself into the story, commenting from modern-day New York City. She writes, in one passage: \u201CIn the park, over the low wall, there are two girls playing in the grass. Giants looming over their toys, monstrously out of proportion. They\u2019re holding hands and spinning, leaning farther and farther back until their fingers rope together, chubby flesh and bone enmeshed. What do I see? Angular momentum around their center. A principle of physics in their motion. A girlish memory of grass-stained knees. I am on an orbit through the universe that crosses the paths of some girls, a teenager, a dog, an old woman. I could have written this book entirely differently, but then again, maybe this book is the only way it could be, and these are the only choices I could have made. This is me, an unreal composite, maybe part liar, maybe not free.\u201D I sense that what you know about mathematics and the kinds of ideas that you spend your life with do leave you with a real nagging question about human freedom, about free will. Absolutely. Talk to me about that. I think it\u2019s a difficult question to understand what it means to have free will if we are completely determined by the laws of physics, and even if we\u2019re not. Because there are things \u2014 for instance, in quantum mechanics, which is the theory of physics on the highest energy scales, which imply that there\u2019s some kind of quantum randomness so that we\u2019re not completely determined. But randomness doesn\u2019t really help me either. OK. So either \u2026 It doesn\u2019t suggest to you that there is space for human decisions and for people to change the way things would go, no? I don\u2019t see how it does. I don\u2019t see how it does. OK. You know, if something randomly falls in a certain way, how is that a gesture of will? So it\u2019s either will has to do with determinism \u2014 my will strictly determines an outcome \u2014 or it doesn\u2019t. So it\u2019s very hard. There is no clear way, I don\u2019t think, of making sense of an idea of free will in a pinball game of strict determinism or in a game which has elements of random chance that are just sort of thrown in. Where does my will come in there? So it doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a free will. I\u2019ve often said maybe someday we\u2019ll just discover something. I mean, quantum mechanics was a surprise. General relativity was a surprise. The idea of curved spacetime. Right. There are limits to mathematics. All of these great discoveries were great surprises, and we shouldn\u2019t decide ahead of time what is or isn\u2019t true. So it might be that this convincing feeling I have, I am executing free will, is actually because I\u2019m observing something that is there. I just can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s there. Or it\u2019s a total illusion. It\u2019s a very, very convincing illusion, but it\u2019s an illusion all the same. So for you, as a scientist, you said this convincing feeling, you simply can\u2019t, you can\u2019t take that as seriously as a calculation that you can prove no matter what? No, I can\u2019t \u2014 and no matter what. You know, our convincing feeling is that time is absolute. It is a very convincing feeling that time is absolute. Oh, right. Our convincing feeling is that there should be no limit to how fast you can travel. You just go faster and faster and faster. Our convincing feelings are based on our experiences because of the size that we are, literally, the speed at which we move, the fact that we evolved on a planet under a particular star. So our eyes, for instance, are peak in their perception at yellow, which is the wave bend that the sun peaks at. And so it\u2019s not an accident that our perceptions and our physical environment are connected. And so we\u2019re limited, also, by that. That makes our intuitions excellent for ordinary things, for ordinary life. And that\u2019s how we evolve. That\u2019s how our brains evolved and our perceptions evolved, was to respond to things like the Sun and the Earth and these scales. And if we were quantum particles, we would think quantum mechanics was totally intuitive. And it\u2019s not intuitive for anybody else that we would think that things fluctuating in and out of existence or not being certain or whether they\u2019re particles or waves or \u2014 these kinds of strange things that come out of quantum theory would seem absolutely natural. And what would seem really bizarre is the kind of rigid, clear-cut world that we live in. So I guess my answer would be that our intuitions are based on our minds, our minds are based on our neural structures, our neural structures evolved on a planet, under a sun, with very specific conditions. So we reflect the physical world that we evolved from. So I guess \u2014 I guess the bottom line is that our intuitions are good, our intuitions are good for a lot of things. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re good. Yeah. It\u2019s not a miracle. And so, I mean, as you have come to see things this way through your work as a scientist \u2014 I mean, do you live differently because of that? Do you raise your children differently because of that? Or is it just a puzzle that you hold, that you carry forward? The question about free will? If I conclude that there is no free will, it doesn\u2019t mean that I should go run amok in the streets. I\u2019m no more free to make that choice than I am to make any other choice. And so there\u2019s a practical notion of responsibility or civic free will that we uphold when we prosecute somebody, when we hold juries or when we pursue justice \u2026 Right, right. \u2026 that I completely think is a practical notion that we should continue to pursue. It\u2019s not like I can choose to be irresponsible or responsible because I\u2019m confused about free will. OK. That\u2019s being even more confused than me. You can listen again and share this conversation with Janna Levin through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today my 2007 conversation with the physicist Janna Levin. We\u2019ve been talking about her poetic novel of ideas, A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines . It\u2019s about two 20th-century scientists, Kurt G\u00F6del and Alan Turing, who helped bring us modern computing and who also pressed on the boundaries where science meets great questions of human life. In her novel, Janna Levin writes, \u201COne plus one will always be two. Turing and G\u00F6del\u2019s broken lives are mere anecdotes in the margins of their discoveries. But then, their discoveries are evidence of our purpose. And their lives are parables on free will. Against indifference, I want to tell their stories.\u201D Both G\u00F6del and Turing ultimately committed suicide. Alan Turing had been celebrated in England for helping crack Nazi codes during the Second World War. But he was later imprisoned and chemically castrated for admitting to a consensual homosexual affair. Last year, almost 60 years after his death, Turing finally received a formal pardon from Queen Elizabeth. Well, I certainly think that both Turing and G\u00F6del are examples of people living out their purpose. Even though they came to tragic ends, those were people who were committed, really, to meaningful pursuits. And if you look at Turing, for instance, he was honest to the end. He really believed in being blunt and truthful. He couldn\u2019t pretend. He couldn\u2019t be a fake. He hated this idea of fakes and phonies. And he couldn\u2019t pretend to be somebody he wasn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t pretend to be heterosexual even if it meant imprisonment or \u2026 Right. \u2026 or lethal poison. And there is a person who, even though he might not have believed in free will, still behaved in a way that I think most people would hold up as being responsible, responsible for himself and believing in truth. And G\u00F6del also, even though he went very astray in his sort of compulsions and his paranoia and his imaginings, was very committed to being truthful, in a sense, to really following logic where it lead him and to not deceiving himself or taking an easier path. And so I think both of those are admirable examples of people living up to their innate purpose. Those are two extreme stories. And I do want to say that although there is real tragedy in them, you present them in a very human light. And we also see what was wonderful about these human beings and what they brought into the world. So I don\u2019t want to say that, you know, here are these stories just of tragedy. Right. But, you know, just \u2014 I mean, a more kind of mundane question is, you know, how does the messiness of just of experience, you know, of all of us, you know, not just our, what we can know, but just how life unfolds, how does that impinge on, kind of, the ultimate reality of what we can know and achieve through logic and through science? I myself would argue that we should never turn away from what nature has to show us, that we should never pretend we don\u2019t see it, because it\u2019s too difficult to confront it. I mean, I guess that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t understand about other attitudes that want to disregard certain discoveries, because they don\u2019t jell with their beliefs. And one of the painful but beautiful things about being a scientist is being able to say, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what I believe. I might believe that the universe is a certain age, but if I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong.\u2019 There\u2019s something really, I think, thrilling about being committed to that. And so, in my own life, I don\u2019t feel that that causes me problems. I mean, I\u2019ve also, in a lot of ways, made easier choices than my two heroes, who I wrote about. Right. I do have children. They did not have children. I do have a certain sense of having a physical comfort around me that they don\u2019t have or didn\u2019t have. And in a way, I\u2019m a much more connected person than either of those two people, even though I still have some of the affinities that they have. Maybe that means that I\u2019ll never go as far as they went in my own discoveries. I hope that\u2019s not the case, but I can imagine maybe it will be. And maybe there is a tradeoff. Maybe sometimes you just have to abandon everything and pursue nothing but that. I\u2019d like to think that if I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ll just get better at honing in on the jugular of things, so that I can still make progress and discoveries as a scientist or have epiphanies as a writer. But yeah, I guess we all just have to find that particular balance. I also sense that you\u2019re pursuing questions, beliefs, I don\u2019t know, hunches about the meaning of life or just about what matters to you in a form that calculations simply can\u2019t contain or convey, that simply can\u2019t be captured in numbers. You mean by writing a book, for instance? Yeah, by writing a book. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, or being engaged with the arts. Right, right. Well, I think that\u2019s true. I think that the answers that we\u2019re going to get, the discoveries that we\u2019re going to make are going to be in mathematics. But they\u2019re going to be meaningless to us unless they\u2019re integrated into a sort of human perspective where we understand why we ask the questions, what the significance of the answers is for us, and how the world is going to change as a result of having made those discoveries. So I think that probably is true. I think that\u2019s why I can\u2019t quit one and become completely committed to the other. Right, right. And I continue to sort of go back and forth between the two subjects. Reading your book about two scientists kind of led me on this path of reading other biographies of scientists. So I\u2019ve been reading James Gleick\u2019s biography of Newton \u2026 He\u2019s a great writer. \u2026 another very complicated character also. And something that reminds me of is, you know, how, what Newton discovered. You know, it wasn\u2019t just important, it absolutely changed the way people thought about the world. And I\u2019m curious about, like, you know, what are you working on right now that is probably not accessible to most of us, wouldn\u2019t even know that these kinds of discussions are taking place? What are you working on that also, you know, starts to reshape the way you see the world around you and the way you move through it? Well, it\u2019s funny, people have often asked, when I\u2019ve been describing the work that I\u2019m doing, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, why should I care about that?\u2019 It\u2019s a fair question, \u2018Why should I really care about that?\u2019 I\u2019m telling something about extra dimensions and maybe the universe isn\u2019t three-dimensional, but maybe there are extra spatial dimensions. It is very abstract. We could do a whole show hammering that out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But supposing we grasp the notion of multidimensional space and spaces are finite, people say, \u2018Why should I care about that? You know, my taxes are high. We have a war in Iraq.\u2019 And these are fair questions, but my feeling is that it changes the world in such a fundamental way. We cannot begin to comprehend the consequences of living in a world after we know certain things about it. I think we cannot imagine the mindset of somebody pre-Copernicus, when we thought that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that the Sun and all the celestial bodies orbited us. It\u2019s really not that huge a discovery in retrospect. In retrospect, so we orbit around the Sun, and we take this to be commonplace, and there\u2019s lots of planets in our solar system, and the Sun is just one star out of billions or hundreds of billions in our galaxy, and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies. And we become, you know, little dust mites in the scheme of things. That shift is so colossal in terms of what it did, I think, to our world, our global culture, our worldview, that I can\u2019t begin to draw simple lines to say, \u2018This is what happened because of it\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s what happened because of it.\u2019 Right, right. We see ourselves differently, and then we see the whole world differently. And we begin to think about meaning \u2014 and all of these questions that you\u2019ve brought up \u2014 completely differently than we did before. And I\u2019d feel the same way if we discovered that the universe is finite or if we discovered that there are additional spatial dimensions, if these things will impact us, I think, in ways that we can\u2019t just draw simple cause-and-effect arrows. And, I mean, does it make you react to simple things differently in your life because you are closer to, you know, that cutting edge of knowledge right now? Well, I think I will often look at what people feel is very important and not identify with what they think is very important. Yeah, OK. You know, I think that\u2019s probably true. I have a hard time becoming obsessed with internal social norms, how you\u2019re supposed to dress or wear your tie or \u2026 OK. \u2026 who\u2019s supposed to \u2014 you know, for me, it\u2019s so absurd, because it\u2019s so small and it\u2019s so \u2014 this funny thing that this one species is acting out on this tiny planet in this huge, vast cosmos. So I think it is sometimes hard for me to participate in certain values that I think other people have. So in that sense, yeah, I guess there is a shift of what I think is significant and what I think isn\u2019t. And if I try to look at that closely, I would say the split is, things that are totally constructed by human beings, I have a hard time taking seriously, and things that seem to be natural phenomenon, that happen universally, I seem to take more seriously or feel is more significant. Well, give me an example. I mean, I think sometimes it\u2019s hard to draw the line. Give me an example of something for you that would be totally humanly constructed and then the other one. Actually, this is going to sound really dangerous, but even things like who we elect as an official in our government. Of course, I take very seriously our voting process and I\u2019m, you know, very, try to be politically conscious. But sometimes, when I think about it, I have to laugh that we\u2019re all just agreeing to respect this agreement that this person has been elected for something. And that is really a totally human construct that we could turn around tomorrow and all choose to behave differently. We\u2019re animals that organize in a certain way. So it\u2019s not that I completely dismiss it or don\u2019t take it seriously, but I think a lot of the things we are acting out are these animalistic things that are consequences of our instincts. And they aren\u2019t, in some sense, as meaningful to me as the things that will live on after our species comes and goes. Does that make any sense? No, it does \u2014 it makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s perspective that you bring, that you have that\u2019s different \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 that\u2019s a bit larger, that\u2019s cosmic. And it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m dismissing things as unimportant either. You know, I take very seriously what\u2019s going on in the world right now, and I\u2019m really pained by what\u2019s going on in the world. But my perspective is to look on it as just as animals acting out ruthless instincts and unable to control themselves even though other people think that they\u2019re being very heady and intellectual. So I do believe and I \u2014 I mean, I think I know this that something deep is met in human beings in a sense of being part of something larger than oneself, being part of something big. And \u2026 Well, I think we are a part of something larger than ourselves. Right, I think you \u2014 yeah. I think we know that for sure. And it\u2019s a remarkable thing to know that for sure. We definitely are made up of material that was synthesized in the cores of stars, a previous generation of stars. We literally are made up of something larger than us, you know? We come from a very specific series of events in this universe, that if they hadn\u2019t happened, we wouldn\u2019t be here. But I think some people might listen to this and feel that if you really internalize this, that possibly everything is predetermined, that we, in fact, are not free in any way, that we are behaving like animals even when we think we\u2019re at our most civilized, you know, that life would somehow be robbed of joy and hope and transcendence. I don\u2019t experience you as a person without joy, hope, and transcendence. No, I don\u2019t feel that way at all. I have a 15-month-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. And the overwhelming feelings I have for them, even if I believe that they\u2019re instinct, do not fade one bit, because of that. It matters to me not at all that I have evolved to feel that way. It doesn\u2019t take anything away from me whatsoever. That feeling is as real, as strong, as beautiful, as meaningful as it is for somebody who believes otherwise. And I\u2019ve never really understood the argument that it takes the shine off of things, when for me, it really doesn\u2019t take the shine off of things. For instance, let\u2019s say somebody said that they had a belief system in which it was simply posited that carbon came out of, I don\u2019t know, a blue sky one day. That wouldn\u2019t make me feel any more meaning about who I was in the world. It feels much richer to me to imagine that a cold, empty cosmos collapses with stars, and stars burn and shine, and they make carbon in their cores and then they throw them out again. And that carbon collects and forms another planet and another star and then amino acids evolve and then human beings arise. I mean, that\u2019s, to me, a really beautiful narrative. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today a conversation with physicist and novelist Janna Levin. It seems to me that there is so much beguiling kind of mystery in science right now. I mean, even language, like dark matter. What is it? It\u2019s \u2026 We can be pretty corny too, you know? No, I know, but \u2026 There\u2019s all kinds of acronyms and \u2026 Right, right. But it\u2019s so, I mean, it\u2019s certainly \u2014 it is very mysterious. Whether that\u2019s the same way religious people talk about mystery or not, there\u2019s real mystery in it. Isn\u2019t that right? Yeah. I think the secret you are uncovering is that scientists often share a very childlike wonder for the world. And so a lot of the language that we invent about the universe reflects that kind of childlike experience. So there is really, at some level, that feeling of excitement over learning about the universe and wanting it to sound a certain way. Wanting the language to reflect the mystery and the magnitude of what we\u2019re learning. So I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re picking up on. I know that you\u2019re now working on the idea of whether the universe is infinite or finite. And somewhat against the grain, you are pondering whether the universe is finite. Explain that to me. There are a handful of people for \u2014 several years ago who started getting interested in this around the world. And I \u2014 and what it would mean is it\u2019s similar to the idea of the Earth. If you\u2019re standing, as I am, in New York City and you walk in a straight line, and then you swim in a straight line, and then you walk again and swim again, you keep going in a straight line as far as you possibly can go, you will end up coming back to New York City because the Earth \u2026 OK. \u2026 is not infinite. It is also not \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have an edge off of which you would just sort of fall off. And so in spacetime, it might be something like that. I travel in a rocket ship in several different directions and I find myself coming back to where I started. I think I left the Earth behind me, I see it go away behind me. And as I approach some planet in front of me, I realize, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s the Earth again.\u2019 And you\u2019ve made this interesting observation that several times in history when science has acknowledged limits, right? I mean, you\u2019d be putting finitude to infinity, that that in fact has made great leaps forward possible. Yes, it\u2019s a funny thing. It doesn\u2019t mean that we throw up our hands and say we can\u2019t know anything, you know? Mathematics is limits. \u2018Oh, no, we don\u2019t do mathematics anymore. Or the speed of light is a fundamental limit, we stop doing physics.\u2019 It\u2019s really been exactly the opposite. Mathematics has limits, and somehow, that leads people to invent a computer. The speed of light has a finite limit, which is what Einstein proposed, and he invents special relativity, and eventually a theory of curved spacetime based on this observation. So it opens up this huge way of thinking about the world, when we kind of accept our limits and just move on. And quantum mechanics was the other example, where quantum mechanics implies a fundamental uncertainty in what we can know about physical reality. And by accepting this, we make these enormous discoveries. So I think, similarly, if we come to accept that maybe the universe isn\u2019t infinite \u2014 I mean, Einstein had this funny thing \u2014 which I\u2019m probably overusing, because I\u2019ve said it a bunch of times \u2014 but he said only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And then he said, \u201CI\u2019m not so sure about the universe.\u201D So he knew that it was conceivable that the universe wasn\u2019t infinite, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it. And only later did we understand how to kind of actually handle it. And if we were to discover that the universe was finite, I think it would again be something like what happened with Copernicus or like understanding that there was a Big Bang. I think it\u2019s hard for us to remember what it was like before the discovery of the Big Bang itself. That\u2019s just such a part of our worldview now. That there was a beginning point. That there was a beginning, that the universe hasn\u2019t always been here, that it isn\u2019t permanent, and unending and unalterable. Right. I just want to come back, this is a nuance of \u2014 we spoke at the very beginning about Kurt G\u00F6del, this, one of the two scientists you wrote about in your novel. And, um, he said there are things that are true that mathematics \u2014 there are things that mathematics cannot prove. They might still be true, but the idea was you would have to go outside mathematics to know that. And you use phrases like, we can\u2019t see the logic of them until we step outside the logical framework. You said something like, \u201CWe have to look at them out of the corner of our eye.\u201D And to me, that again seems so resonant with life as I know it. And I just, you know, I wonder if that\u2019s a kind of idea that you also find you can translate into other aspects of knowledge and experience. Well, I definitely think it\u2019s the reason the book was structured as a novel. I tried to stick as close to fact as possible. It\u2019s not the facts that I\u2019m changing, it\u2019s the approach to the facts. And it\u2019s a sort of confession that no matter how I list these facts, I am somehow not able to get at the truth. The truth doesn\u2019t just drop out like a theorem if I follow certain logical steps. And I think maybe it\u2019s saying something also about maybe my own approach to science. No matter how much I follow these logical steps, no matter how much I make real discoveries that will be unambiguous, I hope, the \u2014 in some sense, my approach to the truth, in the bigger sense of the meaning of the word, will always be a little bit out of the corner of my eye, or the visceral experience of what it really means or what the implications are. There are no true things really out \u2014 except for things as crisp as one plus one equals two \u2014 that are unambiguously true. Right. And yet we know we\u2019re getting closer to the truth even though we can\u2019t always prove it.
