  "fullText": "\u201CPrayers are tools not for doing or getting, but for being and becoming.\u201D These are words of the beloved biblical interpreter, teacher, and pastor Eugene Peterson. He\u2019s the author of dozens of books like Answering God, about praying with the Psalms; and Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places, jumping off a line of Gerard Manley Hopkins. At the back of the churches Eugene Peterson pastored for nearly three decades, you\u2019d be likely to find well-worn copies of books by Wallace Stegner or Denise Levertov. Frustrated with the unimaginative way he found his congregants treating their Bibles, Eugene Peterson translated the whole thing himself and that translation has sold millions of copies around the world. His down-to-earth faith hinges on a love of metaphor and a commitment to the Bible\u2019s poetry as what keeps it alive to the world. All the prophets were poets. And if you don\u2019t know that, you try to literalize everything and make shambles out of it. A metaphor is really remarkable kind of formation, because it both means what it says and what it doesn\u2019t say. And so those two things come together, and it creates an imagination which is active. You\u2019re not trying to figure things out; you\u2019re trying to enter into what\u2019s there. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Eugene Peterson lives with his wife, Jan, at the home his father built in Lakeside, Montana, just outside Glacier National Park. I\u2019d like to start by just asking you how you would start to describe the religious and spiritual background of your childhood. I grew up in a very sectarian church, Pentecostal church. And it was a small little church in the center of town. I guess what I would say is it was exciting. There was just a lot of stuff going on. And going to church was an adventure. Yeah, right. And I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the gospel, but it was a good place to be for a young person, teenager. So I had a positive relationship to the church. It wasn\u2019t always \u2014 I had to outgrow a good bit of it, but it was easy to do. It was. My parents were good parents and faithful and \u2014 no hypocrisy in them. That\u2019s really where \u2014 and I didn\u2019t really get outside of that until I went to university. Right. You\u2019ve written \u2014 or at least I gather in your writing that \u2014 I think you wrote somewhere that the church you grew up in was less interested in this world than it was in spiritual matters. That\u2019s true. But I sense that the \u2014 just the Montana landscape, for starters, kind of formed you, began to form you differently, your own spiritual imagination differently. Yeah, that\u2019s true. We lived in the middle of this magnificent world, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 my parents didn\u2019t do much with it. But when I was a young person \u2014 well, young, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old, I was within walking distance of a range of mountains. And every Saturday, I used to boil a couple of eggs and get some bacon, and ride my bike to the slope of these mountains, and spend the day looking for Indians and looking for arrowheads. And I never found any of that stuff, but it was \u2014 it didn\u2019t make any difference, I was well populated with imagination. So I did have a \u2014 grow up with a sense of the beauty of this place, and how unusual it was, but I did it pretty much on my own. As you just mentioned, my parents were a lot more interested in heaven than in Earth, but it didn\u2019t seem to hurt me. Yeah. I can\u2019t find in your writing \u2014 and perhaps I\u2019ve missed it \u2014 but where were the roots of your love of language, and the care you take with it, the reverence you have for its poetic possibilities? Where did that come in for you? I think I had a couple of teachers in high school who loved language and taught me how to write. And I think a lot of it was just kind of happenstance. I would find a poet and realize that I loved poets. I can put my finger on one thing. We moved across town when I was about maybe 10 years old. And I had no friends, and I had a Bible that I\u2019d purchased with my own money. And I started reading it because I had no friends. And somebody told me that the Psalms were a good thing to read, so I started reading the Psalms. And I couldn\u2019t understand them. \u201CGod is a rock?\u201D What does that mean? \u201CMy tears are in your bottle?\u201D What is going on here? And I just kind of struggled with that, but people had told me it was important to read the Psalms. And about a month into that, I realized what they were. And I didn\u2019t know the term \u201Cmetaphor,\u201D but I realized what metaphors were. And so then I was off. And the Psalms were my introduction to poetry. So, you became a pastor. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were always destined for that. At one point early on, you thought you would be a professor. But you not only became a pastor, you became kind of a pastor\u2019s pastor. And your writing has been so important to people\u2019s formation. And in your most recent book, The Pastor, you write that you can\u2019t imagine now not having become that. But even that, the resonance of that word, in the world reading you now, as well as the world of church, is so radically shifted, changed. And so that\u2019s kind of what I want to \u2014 I want to talk to you about \u2014 I want to kind of draw out your spiritual imagination, your scriptural imagination. And I want to kind of draw you out as a public theologian because I think that all of that speaks to the world we inhabit today, even a world in which a lot of the context in which you grew up and in which you formulated your ideas and your writings is very different. Well, that\u2019s true. I think I became a pastor when I was in graduate school studying to be a professor. And I was going to be a Hebrew and Greek professor, basically. And then I got married. And I went \u2014 then we moved to White Plains. And they didn\u2019t pay me very much at the seminary, and so I had to have another job. So I got a job with a pastor whom I respected. I really never had very high opinions of pastors to tell you the truth. They would come into our town, and hunt and fish for a couple of years, and go for a better place. And so they were \u2014 I liked them. They were fun, told good stories, but there was nothing about God that had any kind of connection with my life. And then I was teaching, and the first course I taught was the Book of Revelation. Right. That\u2019s a great place to start. Yeah, well, it was. And I struggled through that. And then I started reading the Revelation in a totally new way. I had help from the one professor. Well, he wasn\u2019t a professor; he was dead, actually. But he wrote a book on the Revelation, which just transformed my imagination when I realized that John was a poet. This was the first great poetry in the Christian faith. And when I realized that, then all that \u2014 the images, the symbols, and everything started to fit. And I quit trying to literalize them and began to see what was going on. And then that \u2014 and here I was in New York City and \u2014 Babylon. Right. And so I finally found myself living in a world which is outside the classroom. And there were divorces, and suicides, and runaway kids, and it was just \u2014 I never knew what was going to happen on any day of the week, except Tuesday and Thursday when I dumped my classes. So, what you said a minute ago about the poetry \u2014 and you very \u2014 you have actually also \u2014 you are a writer, but also a translator. The Message, your translation of the Bible, is revered by so many people, different kinds of people from Bono, who recently interviewed you, to one of our producers, Lily, actually, who\u2019s there, whose father was a pastor\u2026 Yeah, she told me. Right? And from Colombia and used The Message with his congregation of people whose first language was not English. But what you said a minute ago about the poetry of the text is, even in many of the translations many of us grew up with, not evident, and without that being evident, even sometimes in the way it was laid out on the page, and this is so clear in the way you write about this, the language, then without that context, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t possible to read it. No, that\u2019s true. To understand it, to inhabit it. Yeah. All the prophets were poets. And if you don\u2019t know that, you try to literalize everything. And make shambles out of it. Talk about what difference that makes, even to 21st century people reading the prophets or having an imagination about the prophets. What difference does it make to know that they were poets? Well, it means you\u2019ll learn what the meaning of \u201Cmetaphor\u201D is. And that a metaphor is really a remarkable kind of formation because it both means what it says and what it doesn\u2019t say. And so those two things come together, and it creates an imagination which is active. You\u2019re not trying to figure things out; you\u2019re trying to enter into what\u2019s there. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the beloved pastor and literary theological writer Eugene Peterson. His translation of the Bible, The Message, has sold millions of copies around the world. To give a flavor, here\u2019s how he renders a well-known verse in the Gospel book of John. The King James Version reads: \u201CAnd the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only Begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.\u201D Eugene Peterson translates: \u201CThe Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood. We saw the glory with our own eyes, the one-of-a-kind glory, like Father, like Son, Generous inside and out, true from start to finish.\u201D One thing you wrote about poetry is that \u2014 I\u2019ll just read this. It\u2019s wonderful language. \u201CPoets tell us what our eyes, blurred with too much gawking, and our ears, dulled with too much chatter, miss around and within us. Poets use words to drag us into the depth of reality itself.\u201D I really like this. \u201CPoetry grabs us by the jugular. Far from being cosmetic language, it is intestinal.\u201D I wrote that? Yes, you did. OK. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m pressing on this a bit because I think that really maybe even, again, right now in our time, there\u2019s an interest in the notion of prophets. But I\u2019m also just \u2014 I think you have a way of talking about what prophets bring us partly through the particularity of their language that shakes us out of our regular \u2014 our usual categories of thinking and action. Yeah, I think you\u2019re right. Yeah. I think it\u2019s a \u2014 well, it\u2019s been important for me. I would think it would be important for anybody. But to find a few poets that really strike home to you and then memorize them and use \u2014 to learn to listen to the dynamics of their language. And recognize things that \u2014 if you\u2019re just looking at the words, for me, George Herbert has been one of those poets. Gerard Manly Hopkins, Mary Oliver \u2014 I don\u2019t have a lot of them, but I memorized them because then I can \u2014 their music gets inside my head. And I\u2019m reading poetry without knowing I\u2019m reading poetry. And then that helps with the scriptures too. I didn\u2019t realize \u2014 when I did The Message, I had a congregation of people who didn\u2019t read books. And so I started translating the Bible in their language, not knowing what I was doing. And suddenly, they started paying attention to me in a way they never did before. And so, I think, and I see, I didn\u2019t call it poetry. If I had done that, they would have quit. Right. I think people who use language have to be pretty subversive. I don\u2019t know if you want to grouse this out or not, but we\u2019ve got a huge, huge thing going on in our country now which is \u2014 despises language. Actually though, I mean, what I see that there\u2019s a lot of the worst of what\u2019s happening in the political sphere right now, though, is kind of an extreme version of the way we\u2019ve been so careless with language\u2026 Oh, it is. Right? In general. So I mean, there\u2019s this line of yours, and I actually don\u2019t know \u2014 can\u2019t remember where this came from, but you wrote, \u201CWe cannot be too careful about the words we use. We start out using them, and they end up using us.\u201D Yeah. I think that\u2019s true. I mean, I think that\u2019s informed by your scriptural perspective, but it speaks very directly to profane realities. Yeah. I mean, say some more about how words \u2014 that power of words, and that power of words if we don\u2019t use them carefully enough. Well, the power of words, when they\u2019re used well, is multileveled. Most words have more than one meaning, and if you reduce words just to what you find in the newspaper, you\u2019ve missed out on a whole chunk of human living. And if \u2014 this is where a poet helps us. He trains our minds to hear stuff we didn\u2019t hear before. And that\u2019s what\u2019s quite wonderful about having children. They sometimes use language in a kind of \u2014 they discover words. Yeah. And they start using them in ways we never thought of doing. Mm-hmm. And it\u2019s \u2014 I think children, in their pre-school days, have a lot to teach us about language. It\u2019s true, also, that as we watch our children acquire and master words, that power of words is very evident. Yeah, it is. Something you said about prayer also strikes me as \u2014 it strikes me that when you talk about the power of words, the importance and care with them, it\u2019s not just speaking, it\u2019s also about reading, it\u2019s also about listening. You talk about if we pray without listening, we pray out of context. It seems to me the same thing kind of comes through about speaking. If we speak without listening, we speak out of context, and listening also doesn\u2019t accompany a lot of our public speech now. And I have \u2014 people have taught me this. But one of the best teachers for me has been Karl Barth. Yes. And he\u2019s just adamant about when you pray you don\u2019t ask God for things. You pray to listen, and then when you\u2019ve listened, you can hear God speak, and take you into paths you never thought about. You propose quite a different relationship. I mean, you say, \u201CGod speaks to us. Our answers are our prayers.\u201D Mm-hmm. Does that not make sense? Yeah, no it does. It\u2019s just a \u2014 it\u2019s a whole different way to \u2014 entry point to thinking about what\u2019s happening in prayer to, I think, kind of a Protestant, Western Protestant approach that\u2019s been there in many churches for a while. And that\u2019s one of the things that I think I liked about being a pastor. It\u2019s the working through in conversations of this kind of reversal of what they\u2019re used to doing. And, the ability to make the transfer from asking to listening is really profound. When you start to do it, and sometimes it takes some coaching, some encouragement from a pastor or somebody else, but it\u2019s so freeing. I remember a conversation I had when I was a pastor. I went to see a woman who\u2019s lonely. And she was \u2014 she had a \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they call them, a hoop that you spread paper or cloth over and you\u2019re doing, working in it. Mm-hmm. And what do they call those? Needlepoint or something like that? Or? Yeah. Needlepoint. But there\u2019s a word for that thing you\u2019re holding. Anyway she said to me, \u201CMy life is just limp. I don\u2019t \u2014 I just need something to give me some definition.\u201D And she said, \u201CLike this, this thing I have. You see you can stretch it out tight, and everything starts to fit.\u201D And so, I told her, \u201CLet me get you one of those.\u201D And so I came back in a couple days with a copy of the Psalms. And I said, \u201CThis is it. This is what you need. Just take one of these Psalms and just let your mind stretch around it. And see what happens. Don\u2019t try to read a lot of Psalms, just take one, two, three, whatever.\u201D And it\u2019s amazing what that does. In the New Revised Version of the Bible that many of us read in church, Psalm 22, a cry of anguish from King David, begins: \u201CMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?\u201D In Eugene Peterson\u2019s translation The Message he writes: \u201CGod, God . . . my God! Why did you dump me miles from nowhere? Doubled up with pain, I call to God all the day long. No answer. Nothing. I keep at it all night, tossing and turning.\u201D You can listen again and share my conversation with Eugene Peterson through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the legendary pastor and theological writer Eugene Peterson. His literary biblical imagination has formed generations of pastors, teachers, and lay seekers. You say that the Psalms train us in the conversation with God that is prayer. Yeah. How \u2014 what is your practice of, I mean, so there is this traditional practice in Christianity of praying the Psalms, just praying through the Psalms. And it\u2019s what the Monastics do. Do you have that kind of \u2014 have you had that kind of practice in your life? Or how do you work with the Psalms in your personal spiritual life? Oh, it\u2019s hard to talk about. Yeah. I get that. I get that. Because there\u2019s so much goes into it. Yeah. But for years I have \u2014 the first thing in the morning, I have about an hour of just quiet and coffee. And \u2014 but I picked seven Psalms that I thought were, kind of covered the waterfront of what\u2019s going on. And I memorized them. And I picked pretty long Psalms, so I\u2019d have to work at it. And so, on Sunday, I do Psalms 92, which is a Psalm for the Sabbath. And then I go to Psalms 68, which is kind of a \u2014 it\u2019s a collection of pieces of Psalms from different kind of settings, but when you read through the whole thing, and that\u2019s a pretty long Psalm you realize all of these things kind of fit together if you\u2019re paying attention. When you say all these things, do you mean all the different moves, all the different moves that a Psalm makes from praise to fury to desolation? Yeah, right. Is that what you mean? That\u2026 Right. They\u2019re not logically connected. But then with an imagination, they start to fit together. That\u2019s what I mean. And then Psalm 18 is a Psalm just full of metaphor. And just \u2014 you\u2019re just overwhelmed by all the ways in which you can reimagine God working in your life. And on the just \u2014 I do seven of those. And I\u2019ve been doing that for years. And so, then \u2014 you want to know the whole story? Yeah. Then I shut up. And I just breathe deeply and for another 15, 20, 25 minutes, just try to empty myself of everything. But there\u2019s enough going on through that first entry that it seeps into your imagination. And so you\u2019re not really just emptying yourself, you\u2019re emptying yourself of a certain amount of clutter so that the words you really need to know kind of fit in. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good idea to give people a pattern to work with in prayer. We\u2019re all a little bit different. And I did that myself. I just figured out what I seemed possible to do, and I did it. But, when I was a pastor, I would spend time with people figuring out what to do. Helping them\u2026 Helping them. \u2026find their whatever their seven Psalms might be or their equivalent\u2026 That\u2019s right. Yeah. You know, one of the words that\u2019s important to you is \u201Chonesty.\u201D That the Psalms train us in honest prayer. Yeah. \u201CImmerse us,\u201D as you say, \u201Cin the stream of life as it is, wet and wild.\u201D And I think your books and maybe especially Answering God, but not just Answering God, have been part of the training of seminarians and theologians for a few generations here. And I think one of the things you talk about is that the honesty of the Psalms, that bringing every possible human, everything human, before God, which even lectionaries, I mean, even official Christian texts have often shied away from, or edited out, the cursing, the imprecatory Psalms. The beautiful Psalm that we all know of, \u201CWe can sing by the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept.\u201D But that also has a moment where it says, \u201CHappy shall be he who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rocks.\u201D That\u2019s right. But for you, that honesty, about the human condition, is absolutely at the heart of what is necessary about the Psalms. Yeah. It is. And how else do you get permission to do that except you have something that\u2019s in the Bible. It\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s been practiced, dealt with by people for thousands of years. I was in conversation with Bono just two months ago. And he was talking about \u2014 we were talking about the Psalms, and he says, \u201CWell, what do you do when you get angry?\u201D Unless \u2014 I\u2019m not quoting, and I said, \u201CWell, you\u2019ve got to learn how to cuss without cussing.\u201D And I think that\u2019s what the Psalm like the Waters of Babylon, where he sat down and wept, there are ways in which you can express your anger in a context which doesn\u2019t become mean. And I think that\u2019s what the Psalms have always done. Not just the Psalms, but the stories. Yeah, the Biblical stories. Yeah. I know that you will be aware of this, too, that at this particular moment in history there is some sense that these kinds of passages and imagery in the Bible are part of what is dangerous about the Bible in the world. I think you \u2014 here\u2019s something you say. I think you have a more sophisticated way of talking about what\u2019s going on and what it is meant to work in us. I mean, you wrote, \u201CIt\u2019s easy to be honest before God with our hallelujahs, somewhat more difficult with our hurts, nearly impossible to be honest before God in the dark emotions of our hates.\u201D Talk about what is redemptive and actually good for the world in people being able to bring the dark emotions of their hates before God. Well, I think people need to be given permission to do it, to find a language of hate, disappointment, retaliation, and get that out. People who are \u2014 repress all those emotions often get sick, depressed. Learning how to express our fears, our discomfort, our hate, if you will, it\u2019s often very freeing. So, is it your sense that if people can bring that before God, it\u2019s less dangerous as something that\u2019s in the world? Oh, yes, much less. And that\u2019s just kind of one of the mysterious things about human beings in the world, isn\u2019t it? The mystery of us. It is, yeah. And I think that\u2019s where art comes in too. The artist can sometimes bring out these feelings, perceptions that we don\u2019t know how to do it ourselves. And yet if they\u2019re a good artist, they know what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019re honest, they can be of great help. You wrote in The Pastor, your new memoir, I think you spoke to the phenomenon I\u2019m talking about, which you know we\u2019re talking about how the Psalms of the Hebrew Bible bring every human aspect into the light, even the worst. Yes. And so that is a way of \u2014 but one thing you\u2019ve \u2014 you talk about crowds and you said, \u201CClassically, there are three ways in which humans try to find transcendence\u2013religious meaning\u2026: through the ecstasy of alcohol and drugs, chemically induced transcendance and recreational sex, and through the ecstasy of crowds. And you said, \u201CChurch leaders frequently warn against the drugs and the sex, but at least, in America, almost never against the crowds.\u201D And there\u2019s something about the moment we inhabit, I think even globally, that that feels very resonant and psychologically astute. Well, I think it\u2019s true. But the poets and the writers that use writing as a way of conveying truth rather than just entertaining people. I used to when I was a pastor, I just \u2014 I used to get a pile of books, the same book, like 10 or 20 or 30 books, and buy them, and put them in the narthex, and ask people to pick it up and read it. There\u2019s some really great Christian writers who really keep you burrowed into the reality of your life, the world\u2019s life. Who would be in that pile? Well, Charles Dickens is one. And I think I\u2019ve read all of his books three or four times. Yeah, and most people would not think of Charles Dickens as Christian reading. That\u2019s true, but he is. I mean, that\u2019s Christian reading if there ever was one. Yeah, say some more. Well, he enters into the life of these poor people, and bad people, and stupid people, and makes them come alive. And you \u2014 I\u2019m never going to do that, you think. And then you do. And then you know you did it. Wallace Stegner I think is one of the \u2014 one of our most healthy novelists. And my wife and I have \u2014 we often, in the evenings, we read a book aloud. And I guess we read Stegner\u2019s books aloud five or 10 times. You know, again, I don\u2019t know that people would think of that as a book that would be in the back of a church. I know. I know. This is a huge question, so I\u2019m just going to ask you how you would start to answer it. What, at this stage in your life, like, what continues to perplex you? What do you not have answers for that you would like to have more answers for? What has surprised you, even as you\u2019ve moved through anger, and forgiveness, and sadness, and the things that go wrong in a human life? Well, you know, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m 83 years old now and one of the things that\u2019s surprised me is the lack of questions I have now. It\u2019s kind of like I\u2019ve just entered into a world where everything is going not the way I thought it would go, but the way it makes sense. I forget things a lot. I misplace things and I used to get angry with myself. I don\u2019t anymore. This is a way a lot of the world is living is that\u2026 Yes. Just enjoy it. So you\u2019ve got to go look for your keys for half a dozen times before you find them. And having a family helps. I\u2019ve got three children, and nine grandchildren. That puts you in a context where there\u2019s a lot to be appreciated, and a lot to worry about. And the worries don\u2019t crowd out the glories, but we\u2019ve got to give ourselves permission to do that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the beloved pastor and literary theological writer Eugene Peterson. Here are some lines from his memoir, The Pastor. \u201CMy work has to do with God and souls, immense mysteries that no one has ever seen at any time. But I carry out this work in conditions \u2014 place and time. Place. But not just any place, not just a location marked on a road map, but on a topo, a topographic map \u2014 with named mountains and rivers, identified wildflowers and forests, elevation above sea level and annual rainfall. I do all my work on this ground. I do not levitate. Time. But not just time in general, abstracted to a geometric grid on a calendar or numbers on a clock face but what the Greeks named kairos, pregnancy time, being present to the Presence. I never know what is coming next.\u201D Once you wrote, \u201CPeople ask, \u2018How do you mature a spiritual life?\u2019\u201D And you said the one thing you do is you eliminate the word \u201Cspiritual.\u201D It\u2019s your life that\u2019s being matured. It\u2019s not part of your life. Yeah. But the word \u201Cspiritual,\u201D much more than when you first became a pastor, is everywhere now. Yes. And I want to know how you hear that, respond to it, what you think of it. I think it\u2019s cheap. You\u2019re taking something, and putting a name on it, \u201Cspiritual,\u201D which means it\u2019s defined. The whole world is spiritual and it\u2019s \u2014 and the word \u201Cspirit\u201D is wind. It\u2019s breath. Well, people are breathing all over the place. They\u2019re all spiritual beings, but they \u2014 if you have a name for it, you can compartmentalize it. And that just wrecks havoc with the whole thing. Spirituality is \u2014 and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like the word, because it\u2019s so easy to just say, \u201CWell, he\u2019s such a spiritual person, she\u2019s such a spiritual person.\u201D Well, nonsense. You are too. And I guess that\u2019s where I think the church has a place, which is maybe more important than it\u2019s ever been. But it\u2019s \u2014 done well, there\u2019s no spirituality that you can define. Because it is in everything you do? That\u2019s right. And if you don\u2019t recognize that that\u2019s possible, you just subtract a whole part of your life. And so, I think that\u2019s \u2014 those of us who are teachers, preachers, pastors, we don\u2019t do people any good by trying to make them more spiritual. You have always balanced what I\u2019m going to inadequately call your spiritual life\u2026 OK. \u2026with a very robust intellectual life, a love of ideas, a love of the rigor of the text and the teachings. Has that been something you felt you had to balance? Has it been a creative tension? And that also makes you different than the way a lot of people live with this part of their lives, and in fact, are equipped. People aren\u2019t really given the tools to live with this part of their lives, with that rigor. Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just always loved books. I always loved good books. Loved writers. It\u2019s not been \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been an effort for me. It hasn\u2019t been a discipline. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s been a spirituality. There you go contradicting yourself. I wonder \u2014 you\u2019re 83, you know, I think actually this last exchange just kind of pointed out the complexity of dealing with words, even though they are so precious. And I just wonder if other words, if words themselves, even the word God become too small after 83 years of pondering and grappling with the immensity of the reality, and who God might be. They do become too small\u2026 Does the word \u201CGod\u201D feel too small to you at this point? Yeah. What do you do about that? I pretty much am very circumspect about using it. Yeah. What about the word \u201CChristianity?\u201D Oh, that\u2019s even worse. Right. Well, say, just say a little bit about that. Well, the people who use the word Christianity mostly are thinking of an institution. And that\u2019s hard to get rid of. Most of us have negative influences about the church, certain churches, experiences we\u2019ve had. And so why don\u2019t we just eliminate the word? But how\u2026? Of course that\u2019s hard for people like me who is part of so-called Christianity. Exactly. I mean, your life and your writing is passionately interwoven with this enterprise, this aspiration of church. That\u2019s true. We go to a small church. When I was a pastor of a congregation, people would leave and say, \u201CHow do I pick a church?\u201D Yeah. And my usual question, my usual answer was go to the closest church where you live, and the smallest. And if after six months it\u2019s just not working, go to the next smallest. OK, so what is it about small rather than big? Because you have to deal with people as they are. And you\u2019ve got to learn how to love them when they\u2019re not loveable. And we go to a church now that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m a Presbyterian, but it\u2019s a Lutheran church. And most of the people are my age. And our pastor is young. And he\u2019s a really good pastor. But I don\u2019t go to church \u2014 I mean, I go there to be immersed in what I don\u2019t know about. And these people. I mean, there\u2019s 80 people in church, and I don\u2019t \u2014 I know some of them quite well. I grew up with many of them. I would just \u2014 they still treat me like a little kid. And, so that\u2019s kind of refreshing. So, you\u2019ve written that \u201Cprayer matures into the practice of memory.\u201D Yeah, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s a wonderful sentence. \u201CPrayer matures into the practice of memory.\u201D And I wonder. just as my final question, is that \u2014 has that been true for you? And what does that look like? How does that unfold? And how has your prayer changed even as you pray the same Psalms year after year? Oh, I think the answer is easy. I think I\u2019m praying when I don\u2019t know I\u2019m praying. It\u2019s entered into my subconscious and so I feel like \u2014 I don\u2019t mean for this to sound, quote, \u201Cspiritual.\u201D But it is. It surprises me that something\u2019s been going on in me for years and years and years, which is pretty much absorbed into my psyche now. And it gives me hope. It gives me hope because our politics in this country are not very swift right now. And yet, when I think about individuals I know, they\u2019re doing something \u2014 they\u2019re not discouraged. They\u2019re determined to do it right. And I feel like I\u2019m a colleague with a lot of people who are my companions in this business. And you\u2019re one of them. Thank you. Thank you so much for all that you\u2019ve done and for having this conversation with me. So this is it? I think this is it. Yeah. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Thank you. Eugene Peterson served as a pastor for 29 years. He is the author of over 30 books including Answering God, The Pastor: A Memoir, and The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language."
