  "fullText": "We\u2019re just starting to understand that just because you\u2019re born with a certain set of genes, you\u2019re not in a biologic prison as a result of those genes. That changes can be made to how those genes function that can help. The idea is a very simple idea. And you hear it from people all the time. People say, when something cataclysmic happens to them, \u201CI\u2019m not the same person. I\u2019ve been changed. I am not the same person that I was.\u201D And epigenetics gives us the language and the science to be able to start unpacking that. Genetics describes DNA sequencing, but the new field of epigenetics sees that genes can be turned on and off and expressed differently through changes in environment and behavior. And Rachel Yehuda is a pioneer in understanding how the effects of stress and trauma can transmit biologically, beyond cataclysmic events, to the next generation. She studied the children of Holocaust survivors and the children of pregnant women who survived the 9/11 attacks. But her science is a form of power for flourishing beyond the traumas \u2014 large and small \u2014 that mark each of our lives and those of our families and communities. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Rachel Yehuda is Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience and the Director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. She grew up in a neighborhood in Cleveland that was heavily populated with Holocaust survivors \u2014 a fact she didn\u2019t register so much as a child, but which later became pivotal to the discoveries she has helped make. The way I start all of my conversations, whoever I\u2019m talking to, is just wondering about the spiritual background. Wondering if there was a \u2014 how you would start to describe the religious or spiritual background of your childhood. However you would describe that now. I had a very strong spiritual background. I was raised in an observant Jewish community. I went to a Jewish day school. My father was a rabbi. So there was a lot of Jewish study and Jewish culture and Jewish religion in our home and also at school. So I was surrounded by \u2014 actually immersed in the bubble of observant Judaism. Right. So, you told me that you were the first graduating class where you were given the option of getting \u2014 was this your Ph.D.? In\u2026 This was my Ph.D. Ph.D. in\u2026 Yes. \u2026psychology or neuroscience that\u2026 Yes. \u2026this young field was really just coming into its own and so I wonder how you would start to tell the story of, you know, in your lifetime, the emergence of the difference between what you thought you were going into \u2014 when you decided maybe that you wanted to study psychiatry and how you\u2019ve watched that develop. What\u2019s been fascinating to you to be part of that? What was fascinating from the very beginning \u2014 my work in graduate school was focused on stress hormones. OK. And it was a great deal of interest in understanding the biologic response to stress. And then in the\u2026 Was this like around the time that stress was becoming this word that was in the culture? Yeah, I think stress, as a word, was in the culture really in the \u201940s and \u201950s, also. But it wasn\u2019t until around that time that there was a biology associated with stress. Right. And people were very interested in it. And they were very interested in this idea that something that happens to you generates a biologic response. And people knew a lot about stress hormones from the adrenals. Yeah. But what started happening in the \u201970s and the \u201980s was a recognition that there were stress hormone receptors in the brain. And what that meant was that the brain wasn\u2019t just barking orders at peripheral tissue like the adrenal gland. There was a dialogue going on. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just the brain regulating everything. It was an ability of stress hormones to circle back, and influence how the brain functioned. And even in the \u201980s, as a graduate student, I was awed by that concept. So that meant that things were lodging in our bodies, and that things were happening at a physiological level and affecting our brain and that was new? I think it was new \u2014 I think it was new because everything was new. Yeah. Right. But it was certainly new to me. And the work that I did in graduate school was really following up a series of findings that suggested that when you remove adrenal glands in infant rodent pups, the brain begins to develop much more than usual. And you get an adult rodent that has a brain that is 15% larger than if you hadn\u2019t removed the adrenal glands. And that was really interesting, because what it meant was that stress hormones play a really critical role in how the brain develops and how behavior develops. Wow. So, my understanding is that you wanted to look at this connection in people, and I know I\u2019m simplifying this, but at some point you went back to your old neighborhood in Cleveland, and you started studying Holocaust survivors. And I don\u2019t know if you were studying the children of Holocaust survivors at that point, and you found a similar cortisol profile in them that one would find in veterans who had PTSD. What happened was that I was having trouble understanding the relevance to humans\u2026 OK. \u2026of that work. Yeah. And it was very important for me to be involved with something that was directly clinically relevant. I asked to do some projects in people. And one thing led to another and I found myself at the Veteran\u2019s Administration, just a few years after the official diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder\u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 became known in the DSM. And we were really among the first people, that group, to look at the biology of post-traumatic stress disorder. And the observation that we made, which was really very hard to understand at that time, was that the combat Vietnam veterans showed lower cortisol levels. Right. And it was a surprising observation, because cortisol levels, as you may know, are associated with stress responses. Right. Right. And people that have depression and other kinds of mental illnesses and symptoms often show high cortisol levels. So, this idea that combat veterans had low cortisol levels was really kind of almost a crisis in the field\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and it was a crisis because the diagnosis of PTSD itself was controversial. And one day I said to my advisor, Dr. Earl Giller at Yale, I said, \u201CI don\u2019t know, maybe you\u2019ve just got to pack it up around this post-traumatic stress disorder thing. I grew up in a neighborhood of Holocaust survivors, and they\u2019re nothing like the patients here at the VA.\u201D Huh. And he looked at me and he said, \u201CThat, Rachel, is a testable hypothesis.\u201D And, then it went from there. We decided to drive to Cleveland, a bunch of us, and test the hypothesis that Holocaust survivors were similar to Vietnam veterans. And essentially what we found is that there were a lot more similarities than we would have ever dreamed of. And that they also had these low cortisol levels. Some of the same chemical markers were there, biological markers. Well, that is what we observed. And in terms of the fact that Holocaust survivors notoriously were not treatment-seeking in mental health. Yeah, yeah. We asked Holocaust survivors about that, we asked them about the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. We asked about nightmares. We asked about flashbacks. We asked about those things. They had been suffering many of them for decades with these symptoms. And when we asked, \u201Cwell, did it ever occur to you to go and seek help?\u201D Many of them said, \u201CWho could understand what we had gone through?\u201D One woman said to me, \u201CYou know, Dr. Yehuda, we don\u2019t have VA\u2019s like your veterans do.\u201D Gosh. I thought to myself, whoa. And went home and within two weeks, we established a Holocaust clinic for Holocaust survivors at Mount Sinai. And the field that you \u2014 again, very new, young, even younger field that you have not only stepped onto, but helped \u2014 are helping to shape, is this world of epigenetics. Which is the idea that not only do experiences lodge physiologically, but that physiological changes can actually be passed on to the next generation, transmitted generationally, transgenerationally. One helpful way to me that you\u2019ve talked about epigenetics, is that you said, think about genetics as the computer and epigenetics as the software, the app, the program. Yes. So again, in these old ways \u2014 some of these old ways where I\u2019m learning we think about \u2014 we would think about biological change between generations as being evolutionary, as something that would take time. But what you\u2019re learning is that epigenetics \u2014 it\u2019s a mechanism for short-term adaptation, that even genetic mutation can happen quickly and it\u2019s all around this trauma. So that trauma itself gets inherited. Yeah. It\u2019s not a genetic change, per se, but it\u2019s a change to the program. And we\u2019re just starting to understand that just because you\u2019re born with a certain set of genes, you\u2019re not in a biologic prison as a result of those genes. That changes can be made to how those genes function that can help. Yeah. And maybe some changes are more likely to occur than others, and some genes are more flexible than other genes. But the idea is a very simple idea. And you hear it from people all the time. People say when something cataclysmic happens to them, I\u2019m not the same person. I\u2019ve been changed. I am not the same person that I was. And we have to start asking ourselves well, what do they mean by that? Of course they\u2019re the same person. They have the same DNA, don\u2019t they? Right. They do. And what I think it means is that the environmental influence has been so overwhelming that it has forced a major constitutional change, an enduring transformation. And epigenetics gives us the language and the science to be able to start unpacking that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with neuroscientist and epigeneticist Rachel Yehuda. She\u2019s a pioneer in understanding how environmental and behavioral experiences can transmit effects at a cellular level across generations. So, it makes sense to us, I think, that parents who are traumatized in whatever way, would exhibit things around their children, right? That would affect the children. But what you are showing is that while that is true, there\u2019s also something \u2014 children who, in this sense inherit trauma actually are born with less of a capacity \u2014 some of them, born with less of a capacity to metabolize stress. And is that an actual genetic change? Well, let\u2019s unpack what you\u2019ve said\u2026 OK\u2026 \u2026because you\u2019ve said. \u2026and please keep correcting me. Well, I\u2019m just going to clarify, not so much correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are two ways to influence the next generation at least. One way is to directly transmit something that you have and you transmit it in the form that you have it. So let\u2019s say a change has been made onto your DNA, an epigenetic mark now sits on a promoter region of your gene, for example. And through the magic of myosis that mark gets transmitted through the act of reproduction. The cell divides, there\u2019s reproduction, and the change sticks. And it\u2019s present in the next generation. That\u2019s one thing. That\u2019s a transmitted change. OK. There\u2019s another kind of change that involves giving your child \u2014 either at conception, or in utero, or post conception a set of circumstances \u2014 and the child is forced to make an adaptation to those circumstances. Right. And how would you talk about what the insights of this epigenetics adds into our understanding of those dynamics and what can be inherited, passed on. Well, let me go back to why we started looking at this in the first place. Yeah. We established a clinic for Holocaust survivors and what we found was that our phone did ring, but it was mostly children of Holocaust survivors who called us. And what we began to see quite clearly was that offspring were reporting that they had been affected by the Holocaust in many different kinds of ways, but in a very coherent and cohesive pattern. They talked about feeling traumatized by witnessing the symptoms of their parents. And they talked about the expectations, being traumatized by some of the expectations that the Holocaust had placed on them, such as that they are the reason their parents survived\u2026 Right. \u2026and therefore there was a whole set of things that they would now have to accomplish so that all the people that died would \u2014 they could give\u2026 Yeah. \u2026their lives meaning. They had difficulty in any kind of a separation circumstance \u2014 divorce and those kinds of things. And they described essentially this problem in separating from their parents. I mean, the time we started to treat Holocaust survivor offspring, most of them were in their late 30s or 40s or 50s, and their mindset was to describe themselves based on who their parents were. And most people at that age are someone\u2019s parent or someone\u2019s spouse\u2026. Yeah. \u2026they\u2019re not \u2014 very few people at that age are describing themselves in terms of who their parents were. And I thought that in itself was very interesting. And what did you learn that was surprising and new? Oh, well, first of all, this idea that they felt more vulnerable. That could be supported by fact and it turned out that Holocaust offspring were three times more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if they were exposed to a traumatic event than demographically similar Jewish persons whose parents did not survive the Holocaust. That was real. We also found \u2014 and this really was very surprising to us, that Holocaust offspring had the same neuroendocrine or hormonal abnormalities that we were viewing in Holocaust survivors and persons with post-traumatic stress disorder. And later on we refined that even more so that we realized that the specific risk for certain things, like post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with having a mother that had post-traumatic stress disorder. You have also taken this inquiry to other populations. You\u2019ve studied the children of women who survived the 9/11 attacks and were at certain points of pregnancy at that moment. Is that right? Yes. And so, how \u2014 so because again, I think the Holocaust is such a singularly massive event. Tell me, did you find the same kind of a similar \u2014 did you have kind of similar findings with the post-9/11? We did. We weren\u2019t able to do as extensive a workup. But I want to get back to something you said that\u2019s really very important about the Holocaust being this overwhelming trauma. Yeah. I mean, part of why it\u2019s such an overwhelming trauma is because it happened on such a large scale. Yeah. But what we have to realize is that individuals who are traumatized maybe in a very private way are devastated by the things that happened to them, they\u2019re just not as public. They may not be as prolonged, they may not be as great. But for somebody to be pregnant and in the World Trade Center while those buildings are coming down, that\u2019s your own personal Holocaust. And I think we can understand people a lot better if we take the time to understand the impact that these events have on them personally. Just what we look for when we study the impact of a trauma is how big the event is compared to what usually goes on for a person. OK. It\u2019s this idea of this overwhelming change that is what I think resets and recalibrates multiple biologic systems in an enduring way. So, we have to be able to visualize that in order to understand why the body makes such major and drastic changes, because of course what we\u2019ve been taught in school is that you have a stress response and after a few minutes, everything gets back to normal. Right. We call it homeostasis. The body sort of bounces back like a rubber band and that happens with respect to extremely circumscribed systems, but not with respect to the entire person. You can listen again and share this conversation with Rachel Yehuda through our website, OnBeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in conversation with neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda. The young field in which she works, epigenetics, explores how genes can be turned on and off and expressed differently through changes in environment and behavior. She has pioneered studies with the children of trauma survivors, and helped demonstrate how experiences can transmit a biological vulnerability to stress in future generations. It seems \u2014 and I think this comes through not just in what you\u2019re saying, but how you\u2019re saying it, that this knowledge that we\u2019re gaining about ourselves is a form of power. And that it holds lots of promise and also very practical applications now. So we will talk about that. This science also makes it possible to talk about things that are hard for us to talk about. I mean, this whole notion of generationally transmitted trauma, it gives a kind of a chemical basis for talking about what happens to populations of refugees. Or African Americans in this country who have this history of generational trauma. Or aboriginal peoples in Australia or \u2014 I was reading about some work in generational trauma that Maria Yellowhorse Braveheart did\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026 on the Pine Ridge Reservation. You know, using the term of the soul wounds, the wounding of the Native American soul, this is science that is putting something to that phenomenon that seems to me to be quite new. It\u2019s a more holistic way of describing what happens to human beings. Yes, but it doesn\u2019t all have to be negative. I mean\u2026 Right. \u2026the purpose of epigenetic changes, I think, is simply to increase the repertoire of possible responses. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to damage or not damage people. It just, it expands the range of biologic responses, and that can be a very positive thing when that\u2019s needed. I mean, who would you rather be in a warzone with? Somebody that\u2019s had previous adversity, knows how to defend themselves? Or somebody that has never had to fight for anything? Right. So, you\u2019re saying\u2026 It might be very advantaged in many other social and cultural ways. \u2026so you\u2019re saying that our \u2014 that there\u2019s an intelligence in our bodies, behind this adaptation. Oh, yes. Is that \u2014 yes. Right. Right. There is a wisdom in our body. For sure. But do you know what I mean about saying that it opens up some conversations to be able to talk about this in terms of science and in terms of physiology? It opens up a new vocabulary for talking about things that are very difficult. Yes. I think that\u2019s right. I think that in general the concept of post-traumatic stress disorder has allowed us to acknowledge that trauma effects last. They endure. They don\u2019t all go away. And now, epigenetics allows us to extend it to generational. Yeah. I\u2019m just suddenly aware of a lot of work going \u2014 and I know you\u2019re so much more in the middle of this, but just as an outsider, I\u2019m aware of this discussion and these approaches finding their way. I was in California last year with \u2014 the California Endowment is doing all this work on healthy communities, and putting the notion of trauma \u2014 the children being traumatized, in a much more expansive understanding of what that means based on a lot of this science and trying to acknowledge that and treat that or help the children themselves become more self-aware and to modulate themselves, rather than just punishing them for bad behavior. Yeah, I mean, I think that how we think about legacy trauma changes, if you want. Yeah. Historical trauma \u2014 I\u2019ve given that a lot of thought. In the Jewish religion, we do memorialize trauma. We have many days, we even have a Holocaust Remembrance Day. We have fast days that commemorate the destruction of the temple. We have, on an individual level, we memorialize the date of death of loved ones. We say yizkor, which is a memorial service. But what\u2019s very interesting about that is that these days occur on a specified time on the calendar. They start at a certain time. They end at a certain time and then so too the effects end. So you set aside a certain part of your life to remember and acknowledge, but it doesn\u2019t own you. When you\u2019re able to put something in a context, you carry it with you, but you carry it with you in a way that promotes more reflection, in a way that gives you more of a context, in a way that shows you where you\u2019ve come from, in a way that honors your past. But not in a way that overtakes your past and makes a future predetermined, or impossible. So, I think that we have to be very careful about how we talk about generational effects. A lot of people want to say generational scars, but they\u2019re merely effects. Yeah. You cannot run from your past. But maybe you would run farther if you carried your past with you as long as you can control it. And I think that that is really what we want to understand. We want to understand\u2026 Yeah. \u2026what it means to have a greater repertoire of behavior. What it means to be \u2014 we have a concept about being optimized to your environment. Right? Right. So let\u2019s say, for some reason, your parents transmitted to you biologic changes that are very appropriate to starvation, but you don\u2019t live in a culture where food is not plentiful. Yeah. You\u2019re just not optimized, but I think that if we develop an awareness of what the biologic changes from stress and trauma are meant to do, then I think we can develop a better way of explaining to ourselves what our true capabilities and potentials are. Yeah, I\u2019m so with you. And I mean, what you just described about how Judaism in particular and I think religious ritual, there\u2019s always been this innate wisdom to that, kind of creating a container where the pain and the trauma is acknowledged, but not allowed to \u2014 that it has its place. But it\u2019s challenging for us culturally to \u2014 it also says that when we have this whole issue of race that is so with us now, of this legacy in African American communities, of all kind of layers of trauma across history. It seems to me that one of the things this science is saying is that we, somehow, in the process of healing and addressing that in a new way, there is kind of a need to create that container of acknowledgement. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m just thinking out loud. I just wonder if you think about this kind of implication of this work you\u2019re doing. I think about it quite frequently, because I\u2019m very challenged by thinking how this information could be empowering and not disempowering. Yeah. And one of the studies that we published, maybe a year ago, showed that some epigenetic changes occur in response to psychotherapy. If we\u2019re saying that environmental circumstances can create one kind of change, a different environmental circumstance creates another kind of change. Yeah. That\u2019s very empowering. Yeah. That healing also is transmitted. Exactly. And I\u2019ve been talking in some way or another to survivors of extreme trauma for, I don\u2019t know, more than 25 years now. I mean, really a long time. I think\u2026 Yeah. \u2026I\u2019ve spoken to certainly hundreds, but probably closer to more than a thousand trauma survivors. And I think the message of how you take your trauma forward and use it positively is something that a lot of people really resonate with. I mean, there was a brief moment in our field where many scientists thought that if they could obliterate the memory for the trauma that would be a cure for PTSD. Yeah. But I don\u2019t think that for most people it would be a cure for PTSD. I don\u2019t think most people don\u2019t want to remember what happened to them. They want to not be tormented by that memory, and they want to be able to take all that suffering and convert it into something positive. Yeah. And that\u2019s why you see a lot of trauma survivors engaged in social justice, and trying to help prevent future tragedies. I think that the podium of suffering provides an unparalleled opportunity, not to mention the fact that what trauma does sometimes for people is that it really focuses them on the past. They have a lot of trouble staying in the present. And there\u2019s virtually nothing left for thinking about the future. Right. And really, it\u2019s very important that although you can\u2019t change what has happened to you in the past, there\u2019s this whole future that you might be able to do something about. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with neuroscientist and epigeneticist Rachel Yehuda. She\u2019s a pioneer in understanding how trauma lodges in our bodies and can transmit effects at a cellular level across generations. I do keep being intrigued by how some of this insight, which is human and now it also turns out that we can kind of see it terms of chemistry, is also there in spiritual text. I mean, you quoted this passage from Ezekiel, \u201Cthe fathers ate sour grapes and the children\u2019s teeth were set on edge.\u201D Right, in the Bible, it\u2019s rhetorical. But, the idea is that it\u2019s a hard thing to imagine that if your father ate sour grapes, the children\u2019s teeth will be rotted. And yet, science is teaching us exactly that. Yeah, and I do think it\u2019s important to keep underlining the fact that what you\u2019re learning and what you\u2019re working on is opening up so much new insight and possibility. But it\u2019s \u2014 as you said, there was skepticism about PTSD. This kind of idea still has a ways to go before it\u2019s really settled in our midst. I think that\u2019s right. I think that what throws us off and why these ideas are often challenged is because there isn\u2019t a uniform response to stress or trauma. And it throws things off when the world isn\u2019t that ordered. Yeah. It throws things off when people respond differently to events. So, it\u2019s very hard to have somebody say, \u201Cthis event derailed me,\u201D when somebody else who experienced the same event wasn\u2019t derailed by the event. We have to appreciate that there is quite a lot of variability and diversity in the way that we respond. And some have argued that the diagnosis of PTSD is too limiting, and some have argued that it\u2019s too expansive. But one thing is for certain, post-traumatic stress disorder is one kind of response to trauma, and there are probably many others, including resilience. Mm-hmm. So let me ask a question this way, because it seems to me, you know, what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re contributing to this whole sense of how complicated we are and it\u2019s always a dance between what comes to us physiologically and also how we behave. I mean, it\u2019s not \u2014 I think, what you\u2019re saying is that parents who\u2019ve experienced trauma, do pass that on in ways that have genetic biological force, but there also are experiences their children are having that are about how how their parents are with them, right? Mm-hmm. Yes. So, if I as a parent had a traumatic experience, I mean, if you were working with, say, a mother who had been in a second or third trimester on 9/11, as you say, people who you\u2019ve worked with. What can a parent do to transmute that, to work with that inheritance factor, knowing that it\u2019s there? You know what I\u2019m asking? What \u2014 how do you\u2026 Yeah, and I\u2019m really glad that you brought up the 9/11 study, because we sort of didn\u2019t finish the loop on talking about it. Yeah. The reason that that study was so pivotal, even though we weren\u2019t able to do as comprehensive a biologic assessment as we had been able to do in adults, was that what we learned was that there was a trimester effect on cortisol levels in the babies. And that was really huge for us. And it opened a lot of doors for us. Because we began to understand that some of the differences between maternal and paternal trauma and risk might have to do with the very special in utero changes or in utero contributions to what we call developmental programming, which is really about changing the stress system so that it can have this greater repertoire. So you asked me a concrete question of what I would say to a second or third trimester mother. Yeah. What I generally say to people that have a lot more to overcome, because their biology has given their condition a firmer reality is that you have to work harder or you have to understand that a lot of what you have is biologically driven. And I find that just this information\u2026 Just the information, just naming it. \u2026just the information. Yeah. There was one time in one of the Holocaust groups \u2014 one of the women was talking about something stressful that had happened at work. It was in a group psychotherapy, and it was a terrible story. But then she stopped and she said, \u201C\u2026and then I remembered that Dr. Yehuda said, I have poor shock absorbers and I should just let it pass because my biology is going to have extreme responses before it calms down. And then I did and it really worked.\u201D Now, I didn\u2019t say that. OK. I wasn\u2019t that clever. But what was so interesting was how she had internalized the information that her stress system was more responsive and had used it to actually calm down all by herself in response to a stressful situation. So I pointed that out, of course, because it had nothing to do with me. But it\u2019s just the power of information. It\u2019s that knowledge as a form of power, just the knowledge itself. Exactly, and I think if we know what\u2019s going on in our bodies, then it just takes a lot of the confusion and the panic away from it, especially if we have this idea that this is a step on the way to having an equilibration of some sort. Does what you\u2019re learning also hold for parents who, let\u2019s say \u2014 I\u2019ll just be personal here \u2014 I\u2019ve struggled with depression at times and I think when you have something like that, of course we know that genetically there can be predispositions for these things. But it also feels like it\u2019s in this category of something that you worry about passing onto your children in every possible way. I mean, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just \u2014 and that depression does \u2014 can feel like a form of trauma in its way. Oh, absolutely. Depression is horrible. Yeah. And it does pass to children. But I think one of the things that can be very empowering is to pass along coping strategies. Instead of saying things like, \u201CWell I have depression, but that can never happen to you.\u201D Yeah. You say things like, \u201CI worry sometimes that you might get scared when you\u2019re down.\u201D And when I\u2019m down, it\u2019s awful. But I can reflect back on it and know it\u2019s an illness. Or something that can be, again, a tool. So the worst thing that you can probably do when you have depression is to not name it. And to make a lot of attributions that are not valid about your character or\u2026 Yeah. \u2026about other things or that you\u2019re not trying hard enough. The thing to do when you feel your depression is what you would do when you feel any illness, and that is have it treated. And of course, not every illness is treated very easily. But you deal with it for what it is. So, teaching somebody how they might deal with something that you might pass on is probably the thing that I would recommend. And we\u2019ve talked about how this research speaks to the whole idea about generationally transmitted trauma speaks to also groups of people. Do you work at all in communities? Is this science being brought into \u2014 to the communal level like this, or is it useful at that level? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not really dealing with things in that manner. Yeah. And ironically and interestingly, we have our religious leaders do a lot of this communal trauma work. That communal \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s right. And \u2014 because you don\u2019t have a mental health professional up there in front of, you know, many families, praying because something bad has just happened. Yeah. So, I think that we charge our spiritual leaders with doing a lot of this work. Well, what you said a little while ago though is that the spiritual traditions have actually created these containers for doing the naming, right? And putting ritual around it so that it has its place? But it also has boundaries, and also I just think there\u2019s language like \u2014 there\u2019s the language of Lamentations you know what I mean? That we don\u2019t\u2026 Mm-hmm. Yeah. \u2026that we don\u2019t have culturally, but it\u2019s so necessary to the reality of \u2014 Well, Jewish tradition believes that the same person who wrote Lamentations also wrote the Song of Songs, so\u2026 Yeah. \u2026so it\u2019s \u2014 can\u2019t verify it for you, but the idea is that this is a moment, it\u2019s an expression. It\u2019s a time of your life. It\u2019s not necessarily defining you always. People can have periods of good functioning and periods of bad functioning and it can be quite uneven. There could be triggers that make things worse. There could be good environmental circumstances that make things better. There could just be a natural cycle. Time can make things better or make things worse. So, there are just a lot of different ways of really approaching this. I have to say, I\u2019m so struck, kind of, coming back to what you said to me at the beginning about the fact that we hear people say something traumatic happened to them, and it could be a veteran who came back from war, it could be rape, it could be a violent accident or a criminal attack and they say \u201Cit changed me.\u201D And your \u2014 this knowledge that have you now is that, in fact, it did. It changed people with genetic force, and it can\u2026 Epigenetic. \u2026epigenetic force that it can be passed\u2026 OK. \u2026it can be passed on. Also, I\u2019m so struck by the fact that this knowledge itself, just acknowledging the force of what has happened to us, that the force of trauma itself is a piece of knowledge that, I don\u2019t know if you want to say it\u2019s healing, but that it helps. That it\u2019s kind of a \u2014 it\u2019s a building block to healing. I think it\u2019s a necessary prerequisite for healing. You have to do more than just recognize it. But you have to recognize it. Right. We have a culture that goes to two extremes. They either completely dismiss something as nothing happened, don\u2019t worry, or they get very hysterical about what might have happened. And really what we have to do is give ourselves a little time after an adverse event to kind of take stock and not be so hard on ourselves, or not set expectations and just listen to our bodies and give ourselves the space to be quiet and to heal and to see. To ascertain what has been damaged. And try to counteract that by putting ourselves in the most unstressful, healing environment that we possibly can have to counteract some of that and promote a biological and molecular healing process that might forestall some of the epigenetic and molecular changes. I keep having this memory of some \u2014 an experience I had a couple months ago. I was in the city of Louisville, where they\u2019re working on \u2014 from the mayor to the chief of police to the school system, they\u2019re trying to figure out what it would be to be a compassionate city. And they\u2019re actually using some science in this. They\u2019re bringing some contemplative methods into schools. It\u2019s very interesting and very holistic. And there was an \u2014 actually a pastor, an African American leader, who leads one of the important churches there. And he said that one of the most important transformative things that that this mayor had done \u2014 that young people in his community had said this to him, was to sit with their grief\u2026 Mm-hmm. Beautiful. \u2026to be \u2014 to dwell with the \u2014 and they may have used the word trauma. Just to let that be in the room. Feel it. Yeah. Feel it instead of running to someone to give you a sleeping pill. Yeah. Feel it. I mean, if you want to have that kind of a culture, it boils down to two words. It boils down to being able to ask someone, \u201CYou OK?\u201D You know, just the idea that you are acknowledging the possibility that something bad has just happened to someone and inquiring about them is really, really at the heart of how military cultures really check up on each other and in other healing cultures, you really hear a lot of people saying, \u201CHey, you OK?\u201D And if you\u2019re not OK \u2014 I mean, the fact that you\u2019re not OK, right? That something terrible really has happened, and letting that be \u2014 letting that also be true. Well, the second stage is saying \u201Cno\u2026\u201D \u201CNo.\u201D \u2026when you\u2019re not. But that\u2019s\u2026 Right. \u2026that\u2019s a different problem altogether. Yeah. But just the idea of creating this space for that to be a possibility instead of having the assumption in our lives we just assume everything is OK. Yeah. \u201CHow are you?\u201D \u201CGreat.\u201D Right? We do that\u2026 Right. \u2026reflexively. \u201CHow are you?\u201D has become a pleasantry that is devoid of all meaning. But just really kind of taking a second to inquire in a real way about how someone is doing. And even if they don\u2019t tell you, and even if they lie to you, it will probably have a beneficial effect. I mean, what I hear from trauma survivors \u2014 what I\u2019m always struck with is how upsetting it is when other people don\u2019t help, or don\u2019t acknowledge, or respond very poorly to needs or distress. I\u2019m very struck by that. And I\u2019m very struck by how many Holocaust survivors got through, because it was one person that became the focus of their survival. Or they were the focus of that person\u2019s survival. So how we behave towards one another individually and in society, I think can really make a very big difference in \u2014 honestly, the effects of environmental events on our molecular biology\u2026 Right. \u2026so it it becomes \u2014 it becomes very interesting when you think about it that way. But I think it\u2019s true. Rachel Yehuda is Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience and the Director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
