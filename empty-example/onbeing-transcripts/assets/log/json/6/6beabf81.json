  "fullText": "The civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander is one of the people who is waking us up to history we don\u2019t remember and structures most of us can\u2019t fathom intending to create. \u201CMass incarceration\u201D and the \u201Cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201D \u2014 these are shorthand ways of talking about human wreckage decades on from policies that began during the Nixon administration in the wake of civil rights advances, in the name of reestablishing order. Poor people of color were swept into the criminal justice system as war was waged on drug crimes which were largely ignored when committed by middle- or upper-class whites. Michelle Alexander calls the punitive culture that has emerged the \u201Cnew Jim Crow.\u201D And she is making this visible in the name of a fierce hope and a conviction that, across the differences in this land, we not only can, but already are rising to the transformation to which it calls. The press of our daily lives can make it difficult to imagine alternatives, and to commit ourselves to even small steps towards building a movement that might have some hope of being truly transformational. But all over the country right now people are actually doing that work. In faith communities, in reentry centers, in schools, on campuses, on street corners and barber shops today, people are asking questions that haven\u2019t been asked in a long time, and saying, we don\u2019t want to live in a prison state. How are we going to go about building a movement that can birth something new? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Michelle Alexander is an associate professor of law at Ohio State University. She published The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in 2010, and it\u2019s gradually become a phenomenon, a source of national discussion and reflection. I\u2019d love to hear \u2014 I don\u2019t see a lot of you talking about your childhood or where you grew up. Where did you grow up? Well, I was born in Chicago, actually. But we moved when I was very young. So, lived out in the cornfields of Illinois when I was a young girl, not far from Kankakee, in a very small community. And then we moved to California and I moved around the Bay Area, went to three different high schools, and eventually graduated from a high school in Oregon, in Ashland, Oregon. So no real hometown. And was there a religious or spiritual background to your childhood? Well, my mom\u2019s white, and my dad was black. And when they married, it was still against the law in a number of states. Wow. And my mother was actually disowned by her family when she chose to marry my father. And she was excommunicated from her Lutheran church. And so \u2026 So when was this? What decade are we talking about? So, I guess that \u2014 well, it was in the early \u201860s. So I was raised with the understanding that faith and church are not synonymous. And I was raised with a lot of spirituality in our home, but we never joined a church as a family after that. It wasn\u2019t until I was much older, as an adult, that I found a church in Oakland, California that I began to attend regularly. And you\u2019ve written about the earliest roots of your consciousness of this language, and the notion of Jim Crow. And you wrote that this was \u2014 for you as a kid in school, this was demoralizing, to see pictures of that era and people \u201Cwho look like me\u201D sitting in the back of the bus. And that makes so much sense, and yet I feel like we don\u2019t hear many people talk about it that way, about internalizing this history as children. I hope that, going forward, we give a lot more thought to how we teach race and racial justice in our schools. Because I notice even with my own kids that it can be traumatizing to be sitting in a classroom and, in honor of Martin Luther King Day, be shown pictures and films depicting black people being demeaned, and the \u201Cwhites only\u201D signs, and crowds of angry white people screaming and spitting and hurdling objects at them. And at a young age, it can be difficult to process and to understand how we fit into that history. And I think it\u2019s important for people, young people, to be educated about the incredible courage and heroism of ordinary folks, back then and today, as they struggle against injustice. Yes. Your book, The New Jim Crow, is just extraordinary, and it\u2019s become a really important text. And it strikes me also in the sweep of your work \u2014 you\u2019re talking about telling the whole truth, telling truths we haven\u2019t named. There are shocking, terrible stories in there. And it seems to me that your passion has grown for how this story of the whole truth also is the story of our capacity to change what needs changing. That comes through to me as I see where you\u2019ve been. Well, I\u2019m glad to hear that comes through. I think, in so many ways, the whole process of writing this book, and touring, and speaking to a wide range of people \u2014 I\u2019ve spoken in prisons, I\u2019ve spoken in churches, at judicial conferences \u2014 interacting with a wide range of people who are all slowly awakening to the reality of what we as a nation have done. In this so-called \u201Cera of color blindness,\u201D we\u2019ve managed to create this vast, new system of racial and social control that has relegated tens of millions of people to a second-class status yet again. We\u2019ve done this thing as a nation. I think, for me, one of the reasons that I have become so passionate about this issue is that I think, in many ways, how you respond to the crisis of mass incarceration in the United States is really a critical test for American democracy. Will this American experiment succeed or fail? Research has shown that the most punitive nations in the world are the most diverse. Yes, and that is such a fascinating thing that you draw forward. That the most punitive nations are more diverse, and the more \u2014 the ones we look at and say, those are more structurally compassionate, are more homogeneous. Exactly. And so there seems to be this aspect of our human nature to be punitive towards the other. And in the United States today we have a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow segregation to overcome, and we\u2019re also a nation filled with people of all different faiths, ethnicities, backgrounds, and I think the question that remains unanswered is are we going to be capable of extending care, compassion, and concern across lines of race, of class, of religion, nationality? Or are we going to respond to those we label \u201Cothers\u201D with pure punitiveness? And that\u2019s what happened with the birth of mass incarceration. And you\u2019ve made the point also, often, that this statement that first entered your imagination not that long ago \u2014 I suppose it was maybe ten or 15 or 20 years ago \u2014 that the war on drugs turned the clock back on racial progress. That, initially, for you, was hyperbole and something to be dismissed, not really \u2014 couldn\u2019t reflect the complexity of reality. Yeah. I was raised to believe that there had been extraordinary racial injustice in our history, but that we are on the right path. And we may have a long way to go, but we are on the right path, headed, albeit too slowly, towards that promised land that Dr. King spoke of so eloquently. And in many ways, I think my own parents, being interracially married, felt they had to believe in that, they had to believe that by bringing mixed race children into this world they were bringing them into a world where there was hope for their future. And so I was really raised on that narrative that we were overcoming. And when I became a civil rights lawyer and was a baby civil rights lawyer, just starting out, and I saw that sign stapled to a telephone pole saying, \u201CThe drug war is the new Jim Crow,\u201D yeah, I thought that was hyperbole. I shook my head and said, \u201CYeah, criminal justice system is racist in a lot of ways, but it doesn\u2019t help to make such absurd comparisons to Jim Crow. People will just think you\u2019re crazy.\u201D And then I hopped on the bus and headed to my new job as director of the Racial Justice Project for the ACLU in California. And it was really only through those years of representing victims of racial profiling and police brutality, and investigating patterns of drug law enforcement in poor communities of color, and attempting to assist people who had been released from prison as they faced just one unimaginable barrier after another \u2014 not just to their so-called \u201Cre-entry,\u201D but to their basic survival after being released from prison \u2014 that I had my series of experiences that led to my own awakening that we hadn\u2019t ended racial caste in America. We had just redesigned it. So here\u2019s some of the ways you talk about it that \u2014 for one thing, this fact that the rate of incarceration is not tied to the rate of crime. There\u2019s not a correlation that crime went up, therefore more people are in prison. That\u2019s right. And that poor people of color are swept into the criminal justice system by the millions for drug crimes that go largely ignored when committed by middle- or upper-class whites. And that people then enter this parallel universe in which, as you say, they are stripped of the very rights that were won in the Civil Rights Movement. That\u2019s right. I think most people don\u2019t really appreciate the gravity of being convicted of a crime, particularly if you\u2019re African American. If you\u2019re white and you wind up with a criminal record, very few people look at you and think \u201Ccriminal.\u201D You may get away with not checking the box on employment applications or housing forms. But particularly for black folks and poor folks of color, once you\u2019re saddled with a criminal record, you are stripped of the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights Movement, like the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the right to be free of legal discrimination, employment, housing, access to education \u2014 basic public benefits. You really are relegated to a permanent second-class status. And as I began kind of doing work in poor communities of color that were under siege in the drug war, my mind was blown over and over again by the fact that young kids were being arrested, locked up for the kinds of things that I and my white friends and friends of color had done in our youth and just treated as part of our youthful childhood. Rites of passage. We never even imagined that we would be stripped of rights for the rest of our lives if we had been caught with some weed, or been convicted of a crime. And, I went to college at Vanderbilt University. And when I was there in college, you would go to fraternity parties, and there would be cocaine, people would be getting high, wasted, jumping off the roof of buildings. And you\u2019d go into these communities, poor communities of color, and you see, for so much less, young kids having their futures destroyed. And you have to step back and say, what is really going on here? Why are we treating these kids with such little care and concern, treating them as literally disposable? I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the civil rights lawyer and New Jim Crow author Michelle Alexander. The statistics are \u2014 there are so many statistics, but \u2014 like that, in some American cities, more than half of working-age African-American men have criminal records, which are going to be with them the rest of their lives. And that one in four women \u2014 is this right? One in four American women has someone they love, some family member, in prison. Yes. And one in two black women. One in two. Yeah. And, I think \u2014 I\u2019m glad you raise that, because in my own work, much of the emphasis has been on the experience of black men in the criminal justice system, in part because when I was working at the ACLU as a civil rights lawyer, and we were waging campaigns against racial profiling and working on police brutality cases, so many of the complaints we received and the cases involved men, black men who had been targeted by the police, stopped, frisked, their car searched, torn apart, or being brutalized by the police. And relatively little attention has been paid to the experience of black women and women in general in the criminal justice system. But also all the millions of women who are effectively doing time on the outside, struggling to survive, as their loved ones cycle in and out of prison. There\u2019s a wonderful organization called Essie Justice Group, actually, that\u2019s just been founded, that is designed to support women who have loved ones behind bars. And women who are struggling to take care of children, shuttle children back and forth to prison so that they can remain in contact with their parents or siblings behind bars, and women who often have to bear the economic as well as emotional responsibility of dealing with and supporting their loved ones when they return home. And there\u2019s so much trauma and grief that goes unrecognized. There\u2019s a film that my producer found, and I think you helped create it or \u2014 it\u2019s very short, but it\u2019s women. It\u2019s all kinds of women, all shapes and sizes and colors and ages of women, who have somebody they love, sometimes multiple people they love, and it\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s only a couple of minutes, but that word \u201Ctrauma\u201D is a diagnosis, right? We kind of throw it around, but to see these women \u2014 these beautiful people, right? The grief, really \u2014 it marks them. And also, though, you feel their strength. You feel \u2014 you see what they are carrying. Yes. It\u2019s easy to reduce the phenomenon of mass incarceration to numbers. You can crunch the numbers and show the racial disparities and all of that, but what gets lost is that human dimension, the suffering, the child who grows up visiting their father or mother in a prison waiting room. The grief of having to count down the days to your loved one getting home, and then knowing that when they return they\u2019re not really free. That they will most like be unable to find work, that they\u2019ll be barred from public housing, they may be denied even food stamps for food if they\u2019ve been convicted of a drug felony. That because of some mistake you made or your loved one made, that there will be no forgiveness. There will be no opportunity to ever be welcomed back into your community, into society, as an equal member ever again. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I am so thrilled and encouraged by the growing movement of formerly incarcerated people. Ten years ago, this movement barely even existed, but today, formerly incarcerated people and their families have been organizing nationwide, inspired largely by an organization called All Of Us Or None. Formerly incarcerated people are organizing for their basic human rights \u2014 the right to work, the right to shelter, the right to health care and drug treatment \u2014 basic human rights that we should be able to take for granted in a nation as wealthy as ours, and a nation that advertises ourselves to the rest of the world as the land of the free and a place of opportunity, equality, and inclusion. It\u2019s very \u2014 I\u2019d say there\u2019s real evil in this story of mass incarceration. And yet something in me resists thinking that people were evil. But you have this quote at the very end of The New Jim Crow \u2014 you end with James Baldwin, and I think this is it. He says, \u201CThis is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen. It is their innocence which constitutes the crime,\u201D which is a form of culpability. I wanted to read you something that kept going through my head as I was reading you. And it was a conversation I had with Vincent Harding. Vincent Harding was this great civil rights leader and elder and helped King develop the philosophy of nonviolence. And he said to me \u2014 we were talking about democracy, and he said, \u201CFor me, the question of democracy also opens up the question of what does it mean to be truly human. Democracy is simply another way of speaking about that question\u2026 My own feeling, as I try to share again and again, is that when it comes to creating a multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious democratic society, we are still a developing nation. We\u2019ve only been really thinking about this for about half a century,\u201D he said. Vincent Harding was such an important figure in my life. He passed too soon. But I think what\u2019s he pointing at there is kind of what I was trying to get at before, which is that this whole idea of every person mattering, this is a radical, revolutionary project that we\u2019re embarking upon. And it remains to be seen whether we can succeed in actually living up to, I think, what many of us would describe as our deepest aspirations. And I have probably more hope than might be warranted by the objective facts that we will rise to the challenge of building what King called \u201Cthe beloved community.\u201D I wanted to ask you if that language is resonant for you. What does that mean in the 21st century, \u201Cthe beloved community?\u201D Or do you see that \u2014 if I asked you what gives you hope that you see happening, that that\u2019s even reasonable language, where would you point? Well, I would have to point to the extraordinary people that I\u2019ve met over the last few years as I\u2019ve been traveling around the country, people who have overcome the most unimaginable odds, people who were treated as disposable, who are locked up, locked out, left for dead, utterly forgotten, and who not only have managed to make a life for themselves, but have dedicated themselves to ensuring that no one will ever have to go through what they went through. People who are committed to waking each other up, and to turning towards each other with greater love, care, and concern. As a civil rights lawyer, it\u2019s very common for advocates to get together and start talking about, how do we persuade mainstream, white swing voters to do this or that, or to pass this law or that? And we often treat as progress shifting poll numbers among the middle-of-the-road voters. But I have come to believe that what counts as progress and the source of my hope is when communities that have been treated as unworthy come to believe in themselves, begin to speak in their own voice, begin to organize and act as though their lives truly matter. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. Just in the last couple of years, you\u2019ve seen all over this nation young black folks, but young folks of all colors, waking up, standing up, and I really believe that we will look back and see that Ferguson was a turning point at a time when Michael Brown was shot down and the young people of that community stood up, and dared to say black lives matter. Our lives matter. We are not going to cooperate with this level of injustice anymore. To me, that\u2019s what gives me hope. And I think we have an opportunity here to really see some powerful cultural transformation. And I\u2019m encouraged by the formerly incarcerated people who\u2019ve begun to organize and find their voice, by the young people who are standing up and saying things that may be unpopular, but need to be said, and by people of faith who are beginning to recognize their own culpability in remaining silent as a new system of racial and social control, a purely punitive system, was born on their watch. You can listen again and share this conversation with Michelle Alexander through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the civil rights lawyer and New Jim Crow author Michelle Alexander. She\u2019s one of the people who is waking us up to history we don\u2019t remember and structures most of us can\u2019t fathom intending to create. And she is doing so with a fierce hope and a belief in our collective capacity to rise to the challenge of the present. One way you described \u2014 you use this word \u201Cpunitive\u201D a lot, and I think it\u2019s a word that needs time to sink in, right? For Americans to think of themselves as punitive. But one way you said it in more spiritual language is, \u201CWe\u2019ve become a nation of stone-throwers.\u201D As you said before, set up with a system in which forgiveness is not possible, redemption is not possible, there\u2019s no mercy. And one thing you said is it\u2019s \u2014 and in moving away from that \u2014 it is not enough just to drop your own stone. So how would you start to talk to people who care \u2014 black, white, other \u2014 about first steps? How to begin? I think the first step is saying I\u2019m willing to be awake, that I\u2019m not going to tell myself the same old stories. I am willing to wake up to our current racial reality, our current political and economic realities. I\u2019m willing to wake up, and I\u2019m also willing to acknowledge my own complicity in the systems. I think there\u2019s varying degrees of culpability and complicity. But we all \u2014 all of us, if you\u2019ve been born in the United States, or lived any significant period of time in \u2014 I may not have white privilege as an African-American woman, but I certainly have class privilege. Yeah. And you tell a story \u2014 was it the night of the Obama inauguration when you \u2014 ? That glorious night, you walked out \u2026 And I saw the young man in the gutter, yes. Obama had just been elected the first time in 2008, and I walked out of the election night party and saw a black man in the gutter with his hands cuffed behind his back, and wondered, what does Obama\u2019s election mean for him? I think it\u2019s easy to become overwhelmed and paralyzed, and I can say, in my own life, one of the practices that I\u2019ve come to embrace is the practice of stillness, and learning to stop participating in the madness. And even the act of slowing down and sitting still in a society and an economy that seems to reward constant movement and activity and communication is a bit of a challenging, radical act. It\u2019s a countercultural behavior. But I think it\u2019s necessary for us to think about what contribution we want to make to our communities, to our families. And who we want to be and how we want to show up in this moment in time, in this moment in our racial history, our political history, our economic history, our gender history, all of it. And that takes some time and reflection. What\u2019s distinctive, I think, about what you just said, also, is it\u2019s stillness as a \u2014 not just as a private discipline, but as a public act, as part of your public self. Yeah. I think it creates space where we can begin to imagine alternatives. And I think the media and all of our consumerism and the press of our daily lives can make it difficult to imagine alternatives, and to commit ourselves to even small steps towards building a movement that might have some hope of being truly transformational. But all over the country right now people are actually doing that work. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraged. In faith communities, in reentry centers, in schools, on campuses, on street corners and barber shops today, people are asking questions that haven\u2019t been asked in a long time, and saying, we don\u2019t want to live in a prison state. We don\u2019t want a political system that is owned by a handful of billionaires. We don\u2019t want to be in a state of constant war in countries thousands of miles away. We would like to create a different reality in our communities, a different kind of political system. How are we going to go about building a movement that can birth something new? These conversations are happening, and I think they have far more potential than any of the polling and constant political madness that\u2019s going on in our primary campaigns today. But something that you\u2019ve said that I find very theological is that we have to find ways as we navigate this \u2014 as I think you\u2019re saying, as we reckon with it, we really reckon with what is at stake here, the big questions, this language you use, the big questions that we have to \u201Chonor the criminality in each one of us.\u201D Yes. Say some more. I really believe that this notion of us-versus-them, drawing lines and labeling one another all turns on this notion that we can define who the bad guys are, and rest assured that they\u2019re not us. I believe if we\u2019re going to achieve the shift in consciousness that is necessary, we are going to have to be able to say, and mean, we\u2019re all criminals. We have to acknowledge that all of us have done wrong in our lives. That criminals are not them, over there. They\u2019re us. They\u2019re all of us. All of us have done wrong. All of us have broken the law at some point in our lives. I often say, even if you haven\u2019t experimented with drugs, even if you didn\u2019t drink underage, if the worst thing you\u2019ve done in your life is speed ten miles over the speed limit on the freeway, well, you\u2019ve put yourself and others at more risk of harm than someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of their living room. But who do we shame and who do we blame? I\u2019ve spoken in churches and I\u2019ll say to a large congregation, \u201CWe\u2019re all sinners.\u201D And everyone will nod their head, oh, yes, we\u2019re all sinners. And then I\u2019ll say, \u201CAnd we\u2019re all criminals.\u201D And everyone just stares at me kind of bug eyed, like, what? You\u2019re calling me a criminal? And it was interesting. A young man came up to me after I spoke in one church and he said, \u201CIsn\u2019t it interesting how eager we are all to admit that we violated God\u2019s law, but how reluctant we are to admit that we\u2019ve violated man\u2019s law?\u201D And I think that there is a way in which we kind of give lip service to this idea that we\u2019re all sinners, or we all make mistakes. But we have a difficult time acknowledging, oh, we\u2019re all criminals. Those people that have been shamed and blamed and stigmatized, actually, we are on so many levels not really better than them. We may be luckier than them. President Obama himself wrote in his memoir about doing quite a bit of drugs, marijuana and cocaine, in his youth. And if circumstances had been different for him, if he hadn\u2019t been raised by white grandparents in Hawaii, if he had been raised in the hood, chances are very good he would have been stopped, searched, caught, and far from being President of the United States today. He might not even have the right to vote, depending on what state he lived in. Yeah, that\u2019s very starkly \u2014 yeah. I will say I believe that language is so important, and I do \u2014 I am so intrigued by how \u2014 it\u2019s still fragile, but how I hear this language of mercy and redemption, words like that, entering our public sphere. Yeah, it\u2019s funny, because I just recently read a quote by James Baldwin, and I wish I had it memorized perfectly. I don\u2019t. But it had something to do with \u2014 along the lines of, \u201CYou think that I need to be forgiven, but it\u2019s you who must be forgiven.\u201D I can\u2019t remember exactly the language, but it was this idea that we look at those who\u2019ve been labeled criminals and we imagine that they\u2019re the ones who ought to be forgiven, when in fact we are the ones who may have committed the greater crime, right? The young man who\u2019s caught with some weed in his pocket, he\u2019s hustling to make some money on the side to buy some shoes, or help his mama pay the rent \u2014 how serious of a crime is that compared to the crime we commit by locking him in a literal cage, treating him worse than we would treat many animals, and then stripping him of all his civil and human rights upon release? Whose crime, really, is in need of forgiveness? And I think all of the shaming and blaming that we\u2019ve been doing in recent decades of the poorest and, often, the darkest among us, I think really says more about ourselves than it does about them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the civil rights lawyer and New Jim Crow author Michelle Alexander. I think you\u2019re really eloquent about \u2014 even for yourself \u2014 I\u2019d say, one big theme, really, that we\u2019ve been talking about this whole time that you write about is the conversations we don\u2019t know how to have, we\u2019re just grasping to have, culturally. And I find it very moving when you talk about the conversations it\u2019s almost impossible for you to have as you are out there, and one of them you wrote about in November of 2014 in The New York Times, that \u2014 I think the title of this article, or the subtitle was, \u201CIt\u2019s much easier telling the truth about race injustice in America to strangers than to my son, who will soon be forced to live it.\u201D And that balance that you\u2019re walking as a mother of a black son, of telling him the truth, and doing what every mother wants to do, which is help your child feel safe and comfort them. This was after Ferguson, right? After Michael Brown\u2019s shooting. Yes. It is a painful thing for any parent, particularly black parents, to have to tell their children, \u201CNo, actually, you cannot trust the police.\u201D And when I had to tell my son that I knew that the officer who killed Michael Brown would not be indicted, and that \u2026 Right, because children have such a sense of justice, right? He was asking you \u2014 he\u2019s ten, and he wants you to tell him that there will be a trial. Yes. He was saying, \u201CHow can there not be a trial? At least he\u2019ll go to trial, right? Of course there\u2019ll be a trial.\u201D And you\u2019re a lawyer. \u201CHow could there not be a trial?\u201D And even before the grand jury came back, I knew there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to indict this officer. And I knew, because I knew how rare it is that officers ever get indicted for shooting unarmed black men. And to tell him that, because he\u2019s \u2014 he deserves the truth. I owe him the truth. But also to see how it shatters him, and to know that he isn\u2019t ever going to have the luxury of imagining that, a police officer pulls up behind him in a car, that he will be afforded the same presumptions of innocence that he might be afforded if he were white. And I had an experience with my son when he was very young. Gosh, he must have been five, six, I\u2019m not sure. But he had been playing outside with water guns. It was in the middle of the summer, and I was having to run a bunch of errands and I had told all the kids to jump in the car. We were going to go to the mall. I had to get a gift for someone. And unbeknownst to me, he brings his water gun with him in the car. And we get to the store, we jump out, crossing the street, and a police car drives by. And as the car drives by, my son whips out his little water gun, which I didn\u2019t realize he had it, and starts pointing the gun at the police vehicle and saying, \u201CBang, bang, cops and robbers.\u201D He\u2019s laughing hysterically. And the fear and rage that welled up in me as I practically tackled my son on the sidewalk and telling him, \u201CYou cannot do that.\u201D And it was a knowingness that he wouldn\u2019t just be a little boy playing with a water gun pointing at a police officer, but he would be a black boy pointing what might well be imagined to be a gun at a police officer, that shook me to my core. And when Tamir Rice was killed, my son came home and said, \u201CI saw a picture of a boy who looks just like me who was killed by the police.\u201D And I said, \u201CYeah, he does look just like you. And that\u2019s why I tackled you on the street.\u201D You also tell a story about being confronted by a white woman whose son is in prison, who\u2019s caught up also in this same cycle, which had a sense of racial disorder at its origins, but hasn\u2019t stopped there. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? Yes. A couple of years ago, I gave a talk and afterwards during the Q&A period, a white woman approached the microphone and she said, \u201CI hear you talking about all of the pain and suffering experienced by African Americans and the war on the drugs. And I hear you and I believe you, but I have a child who has been ensnared by the drug war, and they\u2019re suffering, too. What about him?\u201D And I had to say, in all honesty, there are millions of white folks who are serving longer sentences than they otherwise would have, are having their cars or homes forfeited as a result of federal drugs forfeiture laws, who are getting prison sentences rather than drug treatment because of this war mentality that overtook the nation when we imagined, collectively, that drug offenders were black and brown. And not extending drug treatment on demand, not rushing to these neighborhoods with care and concern. How can we help these folks who are living in these communities where work has disappeared due to factories closing down and moving overseas, and where there\u2019s despair and hopelessness and rising drug addiction \u2014 how can we go in and help these communities? No, instead they declared a war on those people. And the mandatory minimum sentences, and the harsh drug laws, and the three-strikes laws, and the scaling back of drug treatment, and all of that, has impacted people of all colors. Right, and it\u2019s that story of suffering, that human wreckage, that human drama, that somehow we managed not to incorporate into our narrative, also, or obviously not our policies. And I feel like that\u2019s what you\u2019ve \u2014 that\u2019s the story you\u2019re shining a light on, and it\u2019s so important. I just wonder how \u2014 as you\u2019ve talked about that you, at some point, developed an obsession with this, the founding paradox of America that\u2019s now so full-blown. How do you think this shapes \u2014 I want to say this calling of yours, this knowledge, but also this calling \u2014 how do you think it shapes your presence in minute ways, in the course of your days? What do you see that you didn\u2019t see before? How do you move through the world differently? I realize that\u2019s a huge question, so maybe just talk about yesterday or today. Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I talk a little a bit at the beginning of the book that once my own eyes were opened, there was no way I could unsee. There was no way that I could be blind anymore to what I had been in denial about for so long. And I think on many levels there are days when I think, oh, life might have been easier if I\u2019d never woken up. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why many of us stay asleep, because we sense that if we really woke up to the full reality and opened ourselves to seeing and witnessing and being present for the unnecessary suffering that exists, and that we\u2019re complicit with, that our life won\u2019t be as easy. More might be required of us, and we\u2019re having a hard enough time making it through the day as it is. But I have to say that waking up and seeing things as they are has also led me to just the most rewarding relationships and work that I could imagine. And I\u2019m grateful to be awake and consciously committed to trying to birth a new America, and no longer lost in this fantasy, this American dream world that if you just get the two-car garage and keep plodding along this path, that somehow we\u2019re going to make it to where we all want to go. So I have to say that I\u2019m grateful. The relationships that I now have, and the work that I\u2019m now involved in is much more rich and meaningful than the path that I had been on before. And how do you think all of this has shaped, evolved your sense of what it means to be human? I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about this notion of \u201Crevolutionary love\u201D and what that means. And it\u2019s something that I spoke with Vincent Harding quite a bit about. And I think for me what it means to be fully human is to open ourselves to fully loving one another in an unsentimental way. I\u2019m not talking about the romantic love, or the idealized version of love, but that the simple act of caring for one another, and being aware of our connectedness as human beings, and also the reality of our suffering, and the reality that we make a lot of mistakes, and we struggle and we fail. That\u2019s all part of being human. We suffer, we love, we struggle, we fail, and then we love again. And I think trying not to imagine that we\u2019re anything more or less than that, as human beings struggling to love and find our way, making mistakes, but still yearning for a deeper connection and a sense of purpose in our lives is what being human is all about. Now of course, so many people, not just in the United States, but around the world, are struggling on a daily basis just to survive. But even among those folks, what I have found is that there\u2019s love to be found. There\u2019s joy there. There\u2019s suffering. There\u2019s redemption. All of it. And that\u2019s what it means to be human. And if we are going to evolve spiritually, morally, as human beings, we\u2019re going to lean in to caring more, and loving more for one another, and honoring our connectedness, and our oneness, and resist that impulse, that fear-driven impulse to divide and label and react with punitiveness rather than care and concern.
