  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CAt Table: The Meaning of Communion.\u201D We\u2019ll explore two perspectives \u2014 Protestant and Catholic \u2014 on the origins and the social relevance of Christianity\u2019s ritual of thanksgiving by way of a meal. Some traditions have made this an extraordinarily elaborate ritual because they want to honor God. Then others come along and say, \u201COh, too complicated. We want something plain and simple.\u201D And that\u2019s going to be the rhythm of the point-counterpoint in the history of this meal to our day. Roman Catholics, I think, very often think about what they get out of Communion. And lots of Roman Catholics don\u2019t often think about what Communion gets out of us, like justice and ethical living and social action. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. From the earliest days, Communion was among the most mysterious of Christian practices to outsiders. But the word Eucharist simply means thanksgiving. Eucharist, Communion and the Lord\u2019s Supper are different words to describe the ritual of thanksgiving that formed around shared meals in early Christian homes. This hour we\u2019ll revisit that history and consider what meaning Communion might have ethically and socially in our time. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, \u201CAt Table: The Meaning of Communion.\u201D In recent years, Dan Brown\u2019s novel The Da Vinci Code sparked popular interest in the story behind Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s painting \u201CThe Last Supper,\u201D which was, in some sense, the first Communion. In a very different vein, the sacrament of Communion became politicized in the 2004 presidential election when a few bishops declared that Senator John Kerry should not be allowed to take Communion because of his stance on abortion. But such images are far removed from the original context of the Christian Eucharist or thanksgiving. Communion, the act of receiving the Eucharist, means fellowship. Jesus and His early followers were Jewish, and the Gospels report the first Communion as a Passover feast. But the language in traditional Communion rites often follows most closely on a passage in a letter of the Apostle Paul. He wrote this of his reported encounter with Jesus after the resurrection. For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, \u201CThis is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201D In the same way He took the cup also, after supper, saying, \u201CThis cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\u201D For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord\u2019s death until He comes. My first guest, Don Saliers, is a Methodist scholar of the history and theology of Christian worship at Emory University. When I ask him about the Communion ritual that evolved from that New Testament story, he begins with the human impulse to share a meal and all that implies. You start with meals. You start with what it means to be at table, the sheer phenomenon of the table fellowship, and that\u2019s a fairly important background term for understanding the evolution of things in the biblical accounts as well as background to Jesus and the disciples. So that\u2019s a wonderful place to start. And I think it does get at where the church started this all those centuries ago. But because that memory is lost, tell me the story of how Communion came to be. Well, we could start just simply with the role of food in some of the ritual practices that go way back in the practices of ancient Israel. The other, of course, is the incredible story of the children of Israel being fed manna every day, bread from heaven. They\u2019re going to a place where there\u2019s going to be milk and honey. And so you get this notion of God feeding and God showing up whenever there is bread broken. And then, of course, the Christian Communion has its biblical roots in the biblical story at Passover, the Passover feast. Precisely. Yeah. And of course that has deep origins in Judaism and certainly in ancient Israel. But that\u2019s the more immediate story, isn\u2019t it? Jesus, who had a lot of meals with His followers, with these disciples, we know He ate in tax collectors\u2019 houses, and that got Him into trouble. But in any event, in the Passover context, where Jesus is heading for His own death and He knows it, the disciples are quite ambivalent about this, He has a meal again with them. And in the context of the sacrifice of the Passover lamb and the notion of the Jewish celebration of the passover from death to life, suddenly He breaks bread, He does the familiar gestures, but all of a sudden He adds those extraordinary words, \u201CThis is my life.\u201D Literally, this is my body broken for you. I doubt that the disciples understood everything that was going on with that. So that, in a sense, literally is the end of a long tradition of meals, a long history of Jesus\u2019 own meal fellowship with the disciples. Now, in the Passover context, He Himself becomes the Passover, but they don\u2019t understand it till later. And still there are a lot of big jumps. I mean, if you actually go back and look at those passages in the New Testament, in Matthew, Mark, Luke and also what the Apostle Paul had to say about teachings he received from Jesus, it\u2019s a pretty spare story. There are those mysterious words in some different variations. And still it\u2019s a great big leap from that to the liturgy we know today to the notion of sacrament, right? To all the theology that has come down to us in the 21st century. Now, my impression \u2014 and I wonder if this is true from what you know \u2014 is that in those early decades in the first century, I mean, what we would see as a precursor of Eucharist, or a Communion, continued in the form of meals that people took in churches, which were in homes. Yes. The first real example we have that is fairly late, and that\u2019s the Dura-Europos house church where we really have the architecture that tells us a bit about that. But quite before that period, we know in Paul\u2019s letters and in some of the other corroborating letters and literature from the time that \u2014 let\u2019s go to Rome, for example c that a lot of these Christians lived in what we would now call tenement buildings. And this is those first, second, third centuries? Mm-hmm. The first. You know, even before really, almost at the close of the New Testament period, we have some corroborating evidences here. And you\u2019re absolutely right that the meal context and the Communion itself are quite commingled, that these were in some sense meals with special blessings, with special memory of Jesus. But at that time it\u2019s a long way from, say, the first full liturgy celebrated in Rome or in Jerusalem, say in the fourth century, from those first what we call the Love Feast or the agape meals. The other distinctive thing about some of those things: We do have enough sociological evidence that the Christians would have their meal, but it always had to be shared with others. With outsiders. With non-Christians? Yeah, with outsiders. Now, that\u2019s where you begin to get some really interesting history. What makes the special in-group meal that we then know as the liturgy of the Eucharist, or the Communion, differentiated from a large fellowship meal to which we share food with others? I think you also point out in some of what you\u2019ve written that Communion in the early church was very much associated with this other value of serving the poor. Very much so. In fact, probably one of the most interesting things for anyone listening, is a little account called Justin Martyr\u2019s Apology, which is written just in the middle of the second century, and it reflects the practice at Rome. And it goes something like this: \u201CWine is brought with bread and water, and then a presider.\u201D This now means that the community has an order in which someone is sort of presiding at the table. And this person sends up prayers of thanksgiving. It\u2019s a blessing prayer. It comes out of the Jewish prayer known as the berachah or berachot. You bless God, and thereby sanctify these things. And then it says, \u201CWe partake of the food,\u201D and then a blessing is said. And immediately this food is taken out to the absent by the deacons. And then it says, \u201CAnd they take care of the orphans and the widows and the sojourners and the strangers.\u201D And that\u2019s all of a piece? It is all of a piece, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so impressive about this early story of Holy Communion, of Eucharist. Quite frankly, Krista, I think the church has struggled to hold those things together, the ritual aspect and the service. Liturgist and theologian Don Saliers. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today we\u2019re exploring the meaning of Communion. As early Christianity expanded, the rituals of the young religion spread to a multitude of cultures. By the fourth and fifth centuries there were major elaborations and a diversity of forms. Then, with the great defining debates of the church, the emergence of heresies and the formulation of doctrine, the meaning of Communion became a source of division. Roman Catholic doctrine insists on the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine, a miracle called transubstantiation. In the medieval church, Communion became a highly ritualized celebration in which the mass of congregants scarcely felt worthy to participate. This was one of the practices against which the Protestant reformers rebelled. Martin Luther declared that Christ is truly present in the Communion meal, but the bread remains bread and the wine remains wine. And as my guest, Don Saliers, has reflected on the history of Communion, he stresses that it was always meant to be transformative socially as well as personally. But he\u2019s said there is an excruciating gap between the mystery of the sacrament and the capacity of the Christian community to turn it into reality. I asked what he means by that. You might put it this way: At the center of this Holy Communion is a broken symbol, but the symbol happens to be a real life. You know, it\u2019s the life, the teachings, the death, the suffering of Jesus Christ. And that is broken even in the words that a lot of our churches, despite their differences, say: \u201CThis is the body broken for your\u2026\u201D; \u201CThis is given for you.\u201D The problem is, as T.S. Eliot once said, we can\u2019t stand that much reality. We confront this symbol of God\u2019s breaking God\u2019s self open for the world, and if we receive this, then we are part of that ongoing power in the world. And I think that\u2019s scary. That asks something of us. So I think one of the things that happens is that people aren\u2019t prepared to receive the implications of that participation in the meal with Jesus. In other words, the meal isn\u2019t just simply my shot of grace, it already is my incorporation into, shall I say, the body, the church, for the world, for the sake of the world. Now, for me then, that\u2019s the theology of presence that I would like to have more churches \u2014 even despite our differences \u2014 understand. That when Jesus comes to speak with us, so to say, and when Jesus comes to feed us, He comes to reconcile, to forgive, to feed, to empower us to be His body in the world and be vulnerable to God\u2019s pain in the world. That\u2019s the radical claim at the heart of this Eucharistic meal, this Holy Communion, this Lord\u2019s Supper. This is just such a different way of thinking about what\u2019s happening in Communion, again, than \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 than you get of watching movies in which Communion happens, right? Or reading about it in the newspaper. So, I mean, where does that gap come from? Oh, it\u2019s just a lack of good education in the basics. Sometimes I think the church teaches sort of silly things around the edges and neglects the most central things of all. What is it together about word and sacrament, Sunday by Sunday by Sunday, if not to build up the body of Christ for the sake of the world? So I lay some of this problem to the doorstep of poor education of the laity. Now, I happen to teach in a theological seminary, so I even see that my struggle is to teach future pastors and priests something of the richness of the mystery of the power of this, because they are going to be the presiders and the teachers of the church, the leaders of the church. But listen, Krista, the other side is the popular culture issue. We\u2019d prefer simple popular images of this than we would the deep, complex ones. But the other side of it is I think we realize somewhere in our heart of hearts that there really is something at stake with this God who has become incarnate in a human life like ours and offers life in a way that nothing else does. I think there\u2019s something in us that is drawn to it and that can\u2019t quite make it out. It\u2019s maybe too much of a mystery, too deep, too demanding all at once. But would that be also sort of a human explanation for some of the reasons that over time this act of Communion became ritualized and elaborate and made more tangibly mysterious? I mean, would that be a way to understand how that could happen? Oh, yes. Yeah, and very early on, too. We could go to some texts in the early centuries where there\u2019s a sudden build-up of mystery. You know, you don\u2019t want to touch the elements because they\u2019re so powerful. So there\u2019s an element of what I even call the superstitious, certainly an element of recognition of sacral power. But then there\u2019s also the kind of popular imagination that starts to develop around the practices. So, you know, it\u2019s so fascinating to my students to learn that in the Roman Catholic tradition in 1215 at the Lateran Council they had to pass a law requiring the laity to commune once a year. That tells you something. You know, what on earth? And then here\u2019s another thing. You know, in the English church there\u2019s this joke about at the elevation of a chalice of \u201CHigher, Sir John, higher, so we can see the miracle.\u201D So the participation was not in eating and drinking, but seeing the miracle happen. Watching the magic trick would be the cynical\u2026 We want that. Right. Listen \u2014 oh, don\u2019t we want it! I mean, we want the magic, we want the quick fix, and here\u2019s God taking the long, slow way. You know, we\u2019d rather have authority and miracle, said Dostoyevsky, than to be vulnerable to the suffering and pain of the world. And then to find out that God is in on that, in the midst of the pain and the suffering, and that part of the meaning of the supper, part of the meaning of Eucharist, is God\u2019s identification and solidarity with that. Wow, that\u2019s a heavy thing. Some traditions have made this an extraordinarily elaborate ritual because they want to honor God for this great gift. I respect that. Then others come along and say, \u201COh, too complicated. Too many layers. Too many symbols. Too many gestures. We want something plain and simple.\u201D And that\u2019s going to be the rhythm of the point counterpoint in the history of this meal to our day. Theologian Don Saliers. Protestantism has encouraged a wide range of practices of Communion in memory of Jesus\u2019 last Passover meal with His disciples. Some churches offer Communion as a standard part of weekly worship; others observe it rarely. Solomon\u2019s Porch, an independent Christian congregation in Minneapolis, draws many worshipers in their 20s and 30s. Couches and reading lamps adorn this warehouse-turned-church in a rehabbed commercial building. Here the weekly Communion is truly a social ritual. Communicants serve each other bread and wine from tables scattered throughout the room. The body of Christ broken for you. The blood of Christ shed for you. May the peace of Christ be within you. And also with you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. My guest, Don Saliers, is a scholar of the history and theology of Christian worship, including Communion, across many traditions. I asked whether he feels that the meaning of Communion is diminished by the fact that different denominations interpret and practice it in such different ways. Let me give you an analogy. Suppose there was a beautiful melody that has haunted you and that you\u2019d do anything to hear it and sing it, and whenever you hear it or sing it, you\u2019re moved by it. But you go to one place and there\u2019s a string quartet playing it, and you say, \u201COh! I\u2019ve never heard the melody quite that way before.\u201D And then you go someplace else and it\u2019s a group of singers singing the same melody in unison. You say, \u201COh! I never realized the sound of the voice could be so with that melody.\u201D And then you go someplace and you hear the Minnesota Orchestra or the New York Philharmonic play it in a big symphonic form and you say, \u201CAh! There it is again.\u201D If that gives you some hint and guess, that\u2019s my experience, as you mentioned before. Right. These are such beautiful words, and yet I\u2019m also wanting to ask you to personalize this a bit. I mean, you have also in the many things you\u2019ve written about worship, you know, you\u2019ve written about the connection between learning to worship with the community of biblical memory \u2014 and Communion is a remembrance \u2014 and the opening up of the interior dimensions of our lives. Give me a window inside how that works for you, the connection between this ritual and your interior life. What comes to mind? Let me just start again with the notion that we live in a time \u2014 and most of us live in circumstances \u2014 in which deep memory is very difficult. We live in a culture of distraction and immediacy and forgetfulness. Here is a ritual that requires us to stop the distraction and to remember profoundly with all who have gone before us. When I talk about biblical memory, I mean literally we\u2019ve got to realize that when we\u2019re worshipping God we\u2019re worshipping in this enormous company of kinfolk. Maybe some people we don\u2019t even like. Probably some people we don\u2019t like. That is the human condition. So, you know, do my anamnesis is the Greek there in the words of institution at the supper. \u201CDo my memory. Do this in remembrance of me.\u201D When that is said, remembering Jesus includes remembering all He has brought. You know, all the people that that grace of God is available to and has won, including people I don\u2019t like. Now, we do have a fancy word for this, too, the Communion of Saints. So when I \u2014 I\u2019m speaking now very personally \u2014 when I commune and I hold with trembling hand a piece of bread, leavened or unleavened, you know \u2014 and there\u2019s another dispute \u2014 and when I hold the chalice, or when I\u2019m given, you know, the cup, I realize with trembling that I am being remembered. See? How\u2019s that? Well, that God is remembering my life in its entirety and remembering the whole of humanity. So my finitude, my inability to love, the string of broken promises which is my life to this point suddenly is going to be mended by God remembering me. And when things get really tough, like they are right now \u2014 war and suffering \u2014 man, I need to go someplace with that. So I\u2019m speaking very personally now that if I didn\u2019t have a place like the meal, I don\u2019t know what I would do. Well, you could go to a psychiatrist, but\u2026 So that\u2019s one function of it. The other function is very positive. Every one of our traditions, despite all of our theological and ecclesial differences, realize that finally there is this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving that we are called to bless and thank and praise God even in the midst of terrible tribulation. So also the other thing that Eucharist does \u2014 and literally, as you said earlier, it means thanksgiving \u2014 teaches me it\u2019s a school for gratitude. And we know that the life that has gratitude at its center is very different from the life that doesn\u2019t have gratitude at its center. This gives me a chance to complete my life by saying thank you. Not for the suffering. No, that\u2019s something else. God doesn\u2019t just send the suffering. But we are thankful for the grace and the community and the support and the life of those who can keep their courage and their hope even in the midst of so much despair. Didn\u2019t St. Augustine say something like \u201CThe mystery you receive\u2026 Oh, yeah. It\u2019s so beautiful. \u2026is you.\u201D Is that it? It\u2019s so beautiful. Is that the quote? Yeah, \u201CReceive the mystery you are.\u201D He also had one other one-liner that \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 isn\u2019t even going to work in the program, but he said this: \u201CWithout God, we cannot. Without us, God will not.\u201D And that seems to me at the heart of Eucharist, too, that God has lavished \u2014 lavished in the simple notion of this bread and wine no matter how elaborated we\u2019ve made it \u2014 lavished that notion, that this is us. \u201CIt is our own mystery we receive.\u201D He also said that. You receive the Eucharist; it is your own mystery you receive back that\u2019s been transformed. And I, for the life of me, you know, that\u2019s kind of my whole vocation: just trying to get people to see what we\u2019ve been given here. Don Saliers is the William R.

Today, \u201CAt Table: The Meaning of Communion.\u201D We\u2019re exploring the original context and relevance of the foundational Christian ritual of eating and thanksgiving. Over time Communion has taken on many different forms and interpretations. There are significant differences between Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant practices. The ritual is variously called the Communion or the Lord\u2019s Supper or, after the Greek, Eucharist, which means thanksgiving. My next guest, Edward Foley, is a Capuchin priest and a professor of liturgy and music at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Roman Catholic tradition attaches special significance to the rite of Eucharist. It is performed daily in memory of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He is believed to be sacramentally present in the bread and wine. Sacrament is a visible sign of an inward divinely conferred grace. But like my first guest, Protestant theologian Don Saliers, Edward Foley stresses that, from the beginning, Communion drew its mystery and power from the human paradigm of the family meal. Even historically, one could argue that there was Communion, in a sense, before there was Christianity. There\u2019s a great line that the church was born around the table. So the Communion or the larger idea of Eucharist, or what Roman Catholics call Mass, it\u2019s sort of like in my own family \u2014 I mean, having grown up when we did sit down and have dinner every night \u2014 that the family in some ways grew out of the table, my own family. And it was sitting around at night and talking and telling stories and arguing and those kinds of things that shape a family. Sort of the way I think about this sacred ritual of eating around a table or standing around an altar in the name of Jesus, the ritual not simply expresses who we are, but it creates us. And I spoke with your Protestant colleague, Don Saliers, and he spoke in very similar terms about thinking of the core of this Christian act as a meal and as table fellowship. You know, in Roman Catholic tradition Communion is a sacrament. I wonder how sacrament and how sacramental imagination then changes or adds another dimension to this basic experience of the church, which was at the founding of Communion, which is a supper, the last supper of Jesus. Look, can I just step back a bit, though? Yeah. While the Last Supper is foundational, one of the things that I think lots of times we forget is the adjective last. It seems to me that the dining experience all through Jesus\u2019 public ministry is sort of paradigmatic of His accepting all sorts of folk to sit with Him. So, as for sacrament, I think you do touch on something that I believe sort of strongly, and that is that Roman Catholics do have a kind of particular imagination that\u2019s been shaped over the centuries, that we do believe that God is like things, like oil and candles and statues. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with that. That God is like those things and that God\u2019s presence is invited in those things? Right. Roman Catholics generally believe that God is more like the world than unlike the world. And, therefore, we feel comfortable with when you go into a Catholic church and see the candles and the flowers and using the oil and incense. And some will suggest that a Protestant imagination is that God is more unlike the world than like the world. Are you a lifelong Catholic? I\u2019m sort of assuming you are. Oh, yes. I wonder if you could talk to me about if you can recall how your sense of this sacrament became real to you? My thinking and my feeling about the sacrament has changed over the years. I think one of the things that happens as a child being brought up in a Catholic family is I understood the rituals, and out of that I began to understand my place in the family. And so I understood as a child how sacred Christ\u2019s presence in the consecrated bread was. I mean, we didn\u2019t walk into a church unless you genuflected, and you genuflected in front of the tabernacle where there was a light burning because that was Christ\u2019s presence in the Eucharist. I mean, I can remember as a kid walking with my grandfather in the \u201950s, and as he would pass a church he would tip his hat. And so I think those ritual experiences of not being allowed to go to Communion until I had gotten through the second grade and had done the preparation. As a priest today on Sunday mornings, you know, watching four-year-olds and five-year-olds grabbing for the consecrated bread, and they understand that it\u2019s important, and they want it. And the reverence that I was taught as a child. I remember some things from First Communion about especially certain teachings. You are not allowed to chew on the consecrated bread, you had to swallow it. Which as I got a little older I thought \u2014 and then as I began to study theology \u2014 I thought, \u201CWell, it\u2019s probably a little overdone.\u201D You know, it\u2019s still a little literal. And then trying to understand what\u2019s the difference between real and literal. And so we believe that Jesus is really present, but he\u2019s really present sacramentally, mediated through the elements of consecrated bread and wine. Theologian and priest Edward Foley. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CAt Table: The Meaning of Communion.\u201D Christian churches open the Communion table to outsiders, meaning other kinds of Christians, in varying degrees. But the ritual of bread and wine remains restricted in Roman Catholic church. Edward Foley describes a complex story that continues to unfold. The irony is that when you look at the table ministry of Jesus, His table ministry was really open to sinners and prostitutes and tax collectors. And, I mean, Jesus sort of says there are two requirements to get into the reign of God: You have to be a sinner \u2014 so we all qualify \u2014 and number two, you have to admit it. And His table was a place where the sinners were gathered. In the early community, if you were a baptized member of the community, you would gather with them and celebrate the Eucharist, recognizing that you were a sinner. There were folk who were cut off from the table even early on. The great sins in the early community would have been anything that would have divided the body, so schism, or heresy or apostasy, denying that you were a Christian during a persecution or something. And if somebody was identified as a sinner \u2014 we do have evidence that there is, before we have this sacrament, of penance or confession in the Catholic church today, that there was what you could call therapeutic excommunication in the sense that somebody would, let\u2019s say that during a persecution they said, \u201CJesus who?\u201D you know, and then after the persecution was over they wanted to come back. And the community says, \u201CWell\u2026\u201D And they would cut them off from the table and excommunication, cut them from Communion. And then they would do public penance for a limited period of time. And then instead of being given what today we would call absolution, they would be recommunicated, which was their return to the community. But eventually in the West, probably with the emphasis on unworthiness with the rise of the monks as the new holy ones in the sixth and seventh centuries, and then the priests and the religious\u2026 And this would be examples of people who seemed to be completely holy? Is that what you mean? Yeah. In some ways you could say that the rise of the monks in the sixth and seventh and eighth century in the West, they were the new holy. And then in the 11th and 12th centuries you start getting theologies of priesthood, that priesthood is a new holiness and it\u2019s the apex of holiness. So I think with those kinds of theological and spiritual developments, the unworthiness of the folk, the emphasis on their sinfulness, the incredible poverty of folk. And, I mean, you\u2019d have a missal or a chalice that would be worth more than they would make in their entire life, and so they would watch. That\u2019s why you start getting practices in the 11th and 12th centuries that people didn\u2019t receive the bread physically, they would look at the bread. That\u2019s why they would ask the priest to hold it up because they felt just looking at it was an act of, later on, what you\u2019ll call spiritual communion. So the idea became then that most people were so sinful most of the time, so unworthy, that they, in fact, didn\u2019t take Communion, or didn\u2019t take it often physically? Right. And that\u2019s why you have, like, a council of the church and Lateran IV in 1215 saying, \u201CYou have to go to Communion at least once a year.\u201D And of course if you\u2019ve committed serious sin, which we presume, then you go to confession before you go to Communion. And if you\u2019ve got a law that\u2019s saying you\u2019ve got to go at least once a year, then the law is good evidence that people aren\u2019t going even once a year, making what\u2019s eventually called their Easter duty. And so that in the 20th century really with Pius X, that was really a move towards much more frequent Communion. Lowering the age of Communion so that instead of being in eighth grade or 14 years old, now you are like in second grade and seven years old. And to get people to go to Communion frequently was really a 20th century \u2014 I mean, you listen to the saints, their writings of the 13th and 12th centuries, and they\u2019re talking to their spiritual adviser about whether they should go to Communion. And in the 20th century did sin seem to matter less? What was the change? Well, there was that great book by Menninger in the \u201970s about whatever happened to sin. And there is a \u2014 and I think this is a rightful concern about church leadership and bishops \u2014 is that where\u2019s the balance between recognizing that nobody is worthy to receive Communion? I mean, if you want to be really careful, I mean, nobody\u2019s worthy, but we\u2019re called. And what\u2019s the balance between inviting people into participation and at the same time not making it so nonchalant and undemanding? Roman Catholics, I think, very often think about they get out of Communion, you know, grace or a morale booster or intimacy with Jesus. And lots of Roman Catholics don\u2019t often think about what Communion gets out of us, like justice and, you know, ethical living and social action. Say some more about how Communion would get that out of communicants? Well, the whole act of going to Communion, or this, you know, supping with God, it\u2019s such an act of intimacy. God says, \u201CThis is my body.\u201D And Jesus is no longer historically present in the world today, so it was like Jesus saying to His disciples, you know, \u201CYou\u2019ve dined on me for three years. You\u2019ve chewed me up, you\u2019ve spit me out, and I\u2019m going to be gone soon. And when I\u2019m gone who\u2019s going to be my body in the world?\u201D And He says, \u201CThis is my body. You eat this, you become my presence in the world.\u201D And when He gives them the cup He says, \u201CThis is how you become my presence in the world. This is my blood that\u2019s being spilt for you, that I\u2019m pouring out for you, that I\u2019m going to literally pour out on a cross.\u201D And so eating the bread and drinking from the cup really calls us to be Christ\u2019s presence \u2014 \u201CSee how they love one another,\u201D \u2014 you know, in the world. That\u2019s what was said of the earliest Christians. Yeah. And if we eat and we drink and there\u2019s no difference and they can\u2019t tell that we\u2019re believers, then maybe we\u2019re missing what the eating and drinking is about. Catholic theologian Edward Foley. The passage to which he just referred about outsiders exclaiming at the practical love among early Christians was reported by the second-century North African church scholar Tertullian. Here is a reading from the Book of Acts, the New Testament\u2019s account of the life of the earliest churches, which links the practice of Communion with outward charity. All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. From the second chapter of Acts, verses 44 through 47. Communion became a political issue in America during the 2004 presidential campaign when a handful of conservative Catholic bishops suggested that it should be withheld from Senator John Kerry because of his record on abortion. My guest, Father Edward Foley, says that this controversy was made possible in part by an unusual outcome of the Second Vatican Council. The council met from 1962 to 1965 and substantively reformed the Catholic church. It drew a new, more direct line between worship and daily life. The first document that came out of that council was about worship, and it was a way that the church sort of said that the way we worship is the way we are. It actually said that our worship is \u201Cthe font and summit\u201D of the church\u2019s life. So I think one of the things that\u2019s \u2014 the good thing that\u2019s going on is that it\u2019s saying that there\u2019s a relationship between worship and life, that worship is not simply something we do in sequestered buildings on Sunday morning in secret. I think there is also a conflict or a challenge and confusion about the relationship between worship and ethics, and that is an ethical life as a pattern. And when you look at the teaching from Rome on this, one has to look at the pattern of one\u2019s life. That\u2019s what Joseph Cardinal Bernardin from Chicago used to call the consistent ethic of life. So one has to be attentive to issues of abortion, birth control, euthanasia, but also capital punishment, war, imprisonment. So how do we think consistently about the ethic? And I think some may have a tendency, especially because the abortion issue is so important and I think has so polarized folk in some ways, that there are some who sort of single that issue out and say, \u201CThis is the issue by which we will judge.\u201D Now, there\u2019s also been some controversy \u2014 and this happened in part in your territory in Chicago \u2014 of people visibly proclaiming their homosexuality being denied Communion. And there\u2019s been some of that. The Catholic church does have a practice of withholding Communion, and that would have to do with divorce and remarriage. If you\u2019re remarried without an annulment, without the church\u2019s permission, then the church believes that you\u2019ve entered into a nonsacramental relationship and you would not be invited to the table. The major one that\u2019s often overlooked is that we don\u2019t have intercommunion with Protestants. So that the sacrament is offered to folk who are baptized, who are in union with the church, and we don\u2019t freely offer it to seekers who are thinking about it. Or other kinds of Christians, people who\u2019re baptized in other churches. And what I want to ask you \u2014 and again, just to help in understanding of this \u2014 I mean, what is happening theologically when Communion is withheld from someone? What does that mean? What is the church doing? Now, the difference for me is that I would find it very difficult to make that decision at the Communion rail, so to speak. But what the church is trying to do, and I think rightly so, is recognize that if we hold this gift so precious and we believe that this is a particular mode of Christ\u2019s presence that was so important it even gave rise to the church, that we\u2019re careful to whom we give it. But I\u2019m quite sure that over the years many, many Catholics who are using birth control or have had abortions have taken Communion, I would think, or done other things that contradict the teachings of the church. I mean, what is the understanding of what happens when they do partake in the sacrament? Well, you\u2019re going to have a wide variety of opinion on that. The interesting thing about sacraments is that sacraments are not for God, that they\u2019re for people. I mean, God doesn\u2019t need sacraments. God is really doing really well without them. And God is self-communicating all the time. So that sacraments are particular ways in which we avail of ourselves of a very particular invitation from God. As a kid I was raised to believe that if I was in mortal sin \u2014 like, for example, if I had missed Mass on Sunday and if I didn\u2019t go to confession before the next Sunday and if I went to Communion \u2014 there would be no grace, no self-communication of God. It seems to me that God self-communicates to people whether they\u2019re sinful or not, whether they\u2019re in a serious sin or not. I mean, did Jesus self-communicate to Judas and did it make a difference? I don\u2019t know. I may get to heaven \u2014 I hope I do \u2014 and find out Judas is there waiting for us because he did repent. And so I would not encourage folk who are living in serious sin to communicate without having a good experience of reconciliation and reviewing their life. But I believe that God is not contained or not restricted by sometimes our limited theology and that somebody in serious sin receiving Communion could still experience God\u2019s grace. And the reality is historically before the first five or six centuries, people, that\u2019s the way they did experience God\u2019s self-communication, by going to Communion. By going to Communion even if they knew they didn\u2019t deserve it? Well, none of us deserve it. I mean, and, see, that\u2019s the other catch, is that we say, \u201COh, here\u2019s a notorious sinner. They should not \u2014 they\u2019re not worthy to go to Communion.\u201D And sometimes the implicit presumption is, \u201Cbut I am.\u201D Some of us are, yes. But none of us are worthy. And I think that\u2019s part of the continuum that we have to keep ourselves connected to. Edward Foley is a professor of liturgy and music at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.
