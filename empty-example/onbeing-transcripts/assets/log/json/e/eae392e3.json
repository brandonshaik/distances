  "fullText": "Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s name is synonymous with Facebook and Silicon Valley success, and she\u2019s the voice of Lean In. Today, she joins us with vulnerability and frankness, together with the psychologist Adam Grant. He was there for her after the shocking death of her young husband, David Goldberg, while they were on vacation in 2015. Adam\u2019s friendship \u2014 and his data \u2014 helped Sheryl find her way to what deep resilience might mean for herself and her children, and even daring to reclaim joy. There is so much learning here for all of us, for facing the unimaginable, and for becoming more practically caring towards the loss that is woven into lives all around us at any moment. When I saw people that I knew were facing real adversity, I would say, \u201CHow are you?\u201D figuring if they wanted to talk, they would talk. But it\u2019s so hard to bring this up. \u201CWell, how am I? OK, my husband just died. It\u2019s hard to get out of bed in the morning. I don\u2019t know how to parent my children alone. And I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019ll never feel a moment of happiness again.\u201D I mean, that\u2019s not an answer to the question, \u201CHow are you?\u201D But if you say to someone, \u201CHow are you today? I know you are suffering. If you want to talk about it, I\u2019m here,\u201D then people can bring it up. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Sheryl Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook. Adam Grant is a professor of psychology at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. They\u2019ve previously written together about gender and working life. Now they\u2019re launching a book and a non-profit together called Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy. Where I think I\u2019d like to start with the two of you is to ask about the religious and spiritual background of your life. And I\u2019ve, over time, come to understand that phrase, \u201Cthe spiritual background of your life,\u201D as very expansive. And, if looking back, you see this notion of what you understand resilience to be now in there, either taught to you or embodied, perhaps, with other names. So, Sheryl, do you want to start? Sure. I was raised in kind of an odd mix of reform and conservative Judaism. My parents kept a kosher home. We celebrated Shabbat. My bat mitzvah was something that I took very seriously, my parents took very seriously. Religion was something that gave kind of a structure, I think, to life\u2019s the calendar holiday. Judaism starts on a different calendar year, and I believed that the year started around when school started in September, October with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. And I think, when I lost Dave and lost Dave so suddenly, religion is, in many ways, the first place you turn because it gives you some things you\u2019re supposed to do. Religion told us that we were supposed to sit shiva, meaning people came over to the house. Religion told us how we were going to perform the burial. There\u2019s this \u2014 in Judaism, when you bury someone, you lower a casket into the ground, and the people themselves, the people closest to them, shovel dirt on the casket. And I buried my grandparents, so I had done that before. And in the face of something so sudden and so tragic, the traditions around the burial, the funeral, the shiva, impossible though they were to live through, I think, were actually very important and very comforting because without them I just would have not known what to do. That was, I think, hugely important because death ushers in such nothingness, such blank \u2014 I thought of it as a void, sucking you in and pushing on my chest so I could barely breathe. And religion was something to hang to in that void. There\u2019s a lot there we\u2019ll keep going with as we move forward. Adam, how do you think about the roots of resilience in your childhood and if there\u2019s a spiritual way that you see that? As I think back to my childhood, I feel like there were a lot of moments where I felt like I didn\u2019t have answers to the hardest things that happened in my life. Like Sheryl, I remember losing my grandparents and not knowing where to turn for explanations, for understanding, for meaning. And I think, in a way, it\u2019s one of the reasons I was originally so drawn to psychology. Mm. Interesting. I was trying to figure out, like, how do we make sense of something that is impossible to really understand, especially as a kid? And looking back, I guess it was going to synagogue and asking those kinds of questions that really got me interested in resilience in the first place. I don\u2019t think I realized it at the time, but looking back, I was constantly asking, like, what happens to people after they die? And how do we make sure that our lives are as meaningful as possible? And I think, in some ways, that\u2019s a question of, given the human condition, how do we find resilience? Can I add a little bit? Yeah, absolutely. The other place religion really matters was this period of mourning, so this shloshim period. And so when Dave died, the rabbi \u2014 my rabbi and another rabbi who\u2019s a friend told me that the period of mourning for a spouse is 30 days. And they\u2019re supposed to kind of have that sense of wrapping up shloshim for a spouse. And that really led me to think about where I was at that 30 days which is what led me to do that Facebook post that was a very important part of the story of my recovery and this book. But again, it was rooted in religion, that there was religious meaning to that 30-day period. I see how it created a container, obviously, for you to mourn, but also to reflect. I mean, and you wrote this stunning three sentences: \u201CI have lived 30 years in these 30 days. I am 30 years sadder. I feel like I am 30 years wiser.\u201D Yeah. I mean, it was a long 30 days, right? The longest of my life by far. And I was, in many ways, marking those days because every single one was just a victory to live through. It wasn\u2019t just the grief. Grief can be so overwhelming. I felt like I was sucked into a void where I would never really be able to catch my breath. My brother-in-law described it as a boot sitting on his chest. But it was also the isolation because I always had very friendly, easy relationships with neighbors, colleagues. When I dropped my kids off at school, I would say hi to everyone. When I went to work, we\u2019d chat before and after meetings. And that all went away after Dave died because I think people were afraid to say the wrong thing, so they often said nothing at all. So as I moved through those days, I was feeling increasingly isolated. I would go to work and people just looked at me like I was a ghost, or they were a deer in the headlights. They didn\u2019t know what to say. And so as that 30-day period approached, I wrote this Facebook post based on my journals, which expressed how I felt, and the night before I went to sleep thinking, \u201CThere is no way I\u2019m posting this thing. It is too raw, too revealing.\u201D Really? Oh, yeah. No, I definitely wasn\u2019t going to post it. But then I woke up the next morning, and my religion told me this was supposed to be kind of the end of mourning. And it was not, and it was not going to be. And I felt so overwhelmingly awful that I thought, \u201CYou know what? I might as well post this thing because things can\u2019t get worse.\u201D And it really made a difference. Because a friend of mine at work said that she\u2019d been driving by my house and not coming in. She started coming in. People at work admitted they were terrified, when they saw me, of saying the wrong thing. Strangers posted about their experiences. A woman posted from the NICU that she just gave birth \u2014 or she had one surviving twin, and one had died. And so she was struggling to find the strength to give the surviving twin a wonderful life. And other people posted on them, and I felt less alone. People weren\u2019t walking up to me and saying, \u201CHow are you?\u201D Right. Or not walking up to you because they didn\u2019t know what to say. Correct. Exactly. And this book you\u2019ve written together \u2014 I\u2019m so happy to talk to both of you because one thing that radiates from the pages is it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re co-authors; it\u2019s that you\u2019re friends, right? That it grows out of friendship. And in fact, I mean, Adam got on a plane and came out to be with you. Twice. Twice. So did not walk away. You\u2019d gotten to know each other together with Dave, right? When Dave was CEO at SurveyMonkey. And it sounds like that Adam started talking about resilience right away \u2014 that you thought that this was about the ability \u2014 could you endure this pain? But the question, Adam, you were asking is instead ask how you can become resilient. And there\u2019s this language in the book \u2014 \u201CResilience is the strength and speed of our response to adversity, and we can build it. It isn\u2019t about having a backbone. It\u2019s about strengthening the muscles around our backbone.\u201D Such a helpful image, and new. Yeah. I guess, for me, this started when Dave and I really connected. And Dave was one of the leaders I really looked up to, but also as a husband and a father, the kind of person that I wanted to be. And I mean, it was just devastating for all of us when we got the news. And I remember talking with my wife, Allison, about whether I should go. It might be a time that it would be difficult for people to have company. And she said, \u201CNo, of course you go.\u201D So I flew out. And I remember being at the shiva afterward, and people were starting to leave, and Sheryl and her family and some close friends were there. And she said, \u201CStay.\u201D And Sheryl\u2019s question was, \u201CWhat do I do for my kids? How do I help them?\u201D And all of a sudden, I felt like all these hours I\u2019ve spent learning about psychology, about how to deal with tough situations, there was a purpose to those hours all of a sudden. And maybe I had some knowledge that I could share that would help her kids through it. And so we started talking about, what do we know about resilience? Where does it come from? How do you help kids find strength in just the worst of situations? Dave gave me a lot of amazing things, and one of the things Dave gave me was Adam. I mean, Dave had a lot of speakers at SurveyMonkey. Adam was the only one he ever invited over for dinner. We were very protective of family dinner. But he said, \u201CThis guy\u2019s incredible. I invited him over for dinner.\u201D Which \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Dave ever did that. And Adam and I started talking about his work, and I asked him, \u201CHave you ever cut your data by gender?\u201D And then we started talking about gender, and we started writing together. We wrote four New York Times pieces together before Dave died. And when Dave died, I was in a total fog. I didn\u2019t invite anyone to the funeral. People came. And I was so relieved Adam was there. And I just looked at him, and I said, \u201CWhat do I do to get my kids through this?\u201D Like, there has to be \u2014 for me, the research is incredibly comforting because there\u2019s my experience, there\u2019s other individual experience, but if people have studied this and figured out what works on large numbers of people, that\u2019s better. And Adam just followed up. He said, \u201CYes, there\u2019s research, and I\u2019m looking at it, and I\u2026\u201D And he would literally send me research summaries, like, \u201COK, there\u2019s been one longitudinal study of children who\u2019ve lost fathers or\u201D \u2014 sorry \u2014 \u201Cwho have lost parents and gone through divorce. Here\u2019s what it says.\u201D And for me, that was incredibly comforting. And then I started calling him more and more with, \u201COK, here\u2019s what happened today, and here\u2019s how I feel, and it\u2019s never going to feel better.\u201D And Adam would say, \u201CThat\u2019s called permanence. That\u2019s one of the traps.\u201D OK. No, but for me, the research and the data \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it would be for everyone \u2014 but for me, it was unbelievably helpful. So, personalization, blaming myself. I blamed myself that Dave died. The early reports were that he died falling off an exercise machine, so I thought if I only found him sooner, he would be alive. And my brother is a neurosurgeon, so this is his field. And he sat there with me, at first patiently and increasingly with more anxiety and passion in his voice. \u201CSheryl, Dave did not die falling off an exercise machine. If Dave fell off an exercise machine, he would\u2019ve broken an arm, not died. He did not die that way.\u201D And then, when we got the autopsy report, and it was coronary artery disease, you know, it wasn\u2019t diagnosed. And should I have known? And then, when I finally got over, \u201COK I\u2019m not a doctor. It\u2019s not my fault I didn\u2019t diagnose a disease that his doctors didn\u2019t diagnose,\u201D I blamed myself for disrupting my mom\u2019s life, disrupting the Facebook client meetings, disrupting Adam\u2019s life. And Adam said to me, \u201CIf you don\u2019t get over the personalization, you are not going to recover. And if you don\u2019t recover, your kids can\u2019t recover. That\u2019s what psychologists know.\u201D I think you said somewhere that he told you to ban the word \u201Csorry.\u201D That you were always saying, \u201CSorry, sorry, sorry.\u201D Oh. Yes. But the reason that was so important was he could prove it. He said people have studied this. And forgiving yourself is a really hard thing, but if you tell me if I don\u2019t forgive myself, my kids are never going to recover, I\u2019m willing to do anything. So Adam just kept weighing in at these critical moments with, \u201CHere\u2019s how to think about this. Here\u2019s what we know.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and psychologist Adam Grant. And Adam, I want to ask you. I started hearing this term \u201Cresilience\u201D emerging a few years ago, kind of early 21st century, often in the context of social infrastructure \u2014 resilient ecosystems, resilient cities. Like after Hurricane Sandy, how do you \u2014 how to rebuild and plan \u2014 assuming that the unexpected catastrophe will come, but planning so that what knocks out one part of the system won\u2019t bring down the whole thing. And you\u2019re talking about resilient human beings. And I\u2019m curious about \u2014 is this a term that has had kind of a new birth or renaissance in psychology as well? Yeah, it is. So, it started to gain a lot of traction in the 1990s, late \u201890s, when Marty Seligman, a colleague of mine here at Penn, pioneered this whole initiative on positive psychology. And he said, \u201CLook, as psychologists, we know a lot about how to treat suffering. We can help people become less depressed and less anxious, but we don\u2019t know a whole lot about how to help people flourish. And it\u2019s nice to cure some of the worst ills that people face in their lives, but what about really living the best lives we can? How do we do that?\u201D And there were a lot of experts who had been sort of already tackling this question, and Marty brought them together. Excuse me. Resilience really grew out of a desire to say, \u201CLook, it\u2019s not enough just to help people recover and try to mend them when they\u2019re broken. We need to understand how to help people find and build strength when the worst things happen to them, which they do. And it\u2019s just exploded as a field of research. There are researchers studying how to build resilience in kids, how to find resilience after divorce, after loss, how to help communities build resilience together. And part of what Sheryl and I were, I think, both really influenced by was just how much knowledge is out there that hasn\u2019t been shared more broadly yet. And it\u2019s a new paradigm in American culture. And the three of us, in very different ways, are great examples of \u2014 I think we were probably born into this world of, \u201Cbe successful, be powerful,\u201D and the whole, like, American self-made man thing. And this is actually being reality-based and saying, \u201CDon\u2019t expect that things will always progress and always get better because life is not like that.\u201D And Sheryl, I think about you. You are the chief operating officer of this incredibly powerful company and force in the world. I mean, you, as a human being and as a professional person, you create order out of the constant potential of chaos. And so I\u2019ve got to imagine this was also a paradigm shift in your approach to your life as Dave\u2019s death opened up just the ground beneath your feet. Krista, I have to say \u2014 I don\u2019t think Sheryl will tell you this \u2014 but her co-author on Lean In, Nell Scovell, who edited this book with us, once told me that just for a day she wanted to own Sheryl\u2019s brain because it would be so convenient to have a brain full of color-coded sticky notes all perfectly organized. And we all live in constant envy of that. But so, even more so, it must be just \u2014 it must\u2019ve been such a shock to your system. It is such an astute question because, yes, until this happened, certainly I\u2019d faced challenges. Everyone does. I\u2019d gotten divorced very young, and that was something that was hard for me to get over and process. But there was no order to this because it didn\u2019t make sense that a grown, healthy man who woke up in the morning and went on a hike could just die \u2014 literally could go to the gym and die \u2014 and out of nowhere at 47 years old. And my story, and I think the story of so many people facing hardship is this balancing between no control, no order, accepting the grief, accepting your emotions, and trying to find things we can do that give us some sense of control. And in that first bucket, I learned a lot. My friend Davis Guggenheim who makes documentary films, he and his wife, Lisa, came and slept over early on. And he just looked at me and said, \u201CSheryl, when I film movies and I do documentaries, I can\u2019t write them in advance. I have to let the story unfold.\u201D He knows me well. He said, \u201CSheryl, your grief has to unfold. You can not put it in a box and wrap it up. There is no sticky note for this. There is no Excel spreadsheet. You have to let this happen.\u201D My rabbi told me to \u201Clean into the suck.\u201D Not what I meant by \u201Clean in,\u201D but what he was saying was you have no control over your feelings here. And learning to accept the lack of control that I have was a huge part of this for me. But then on the other hand, in the void, in the grief, in the isolation, as the mother of two grieving children \u2014 my children were 7 and 10 \u2014 and they lost their father overnight \u2014 you want something to do. So there were moments where I was just desperate for anything I could do, which I think did give me some sense of hope and some sense of control. And that\u2019s where the research and the steps I could take came in. Yeah. Well, so let\u2019s talk about some of those practical learning, those tools for living that you\u2019ve written about. And I mean, some of them are \u2014 like, you were surprised early on that Adam counseled you to focus on worst-case scenarios, which you said\u2026 Oh, no. This was crazy. You said it\u2019s a fine, old Jewish tradition so it made sense on some level, but it didn\u2019t make sense on another. I mean, Adam looked at me and said, \u201CYou should think about how things could be worse.\u201D And I thought to myself, \u201CDave just died suddenly. How can things be worse?\u201D And he said, \u201CHe could\u2019ve had that cardiac arrhythmia driving your children.\u201D I mean, in that instant, to this day, when I say that, I feel better. I\u2019m like, OK my kids are alive. I\u2019m fine. Literally. Because think about the devastation I felt with Dave, and the devastation of losing all three of them in one instant, which happens. And all of a sudden, you\u2019re better. And you would think that when you\u2019re trying to find a way forward, you want to think about happy thoughts, but actually, what you want to do is find gratitude, gratitude for what\u2019s left. And one way of doing that is think about how things could be worse. And that really did work, because the minute I thought about the fact that I\u2019m lucky to still have my children alive, what I found was gratitude. Thank god my children are alive. And I can raise them, and I can raise them to know who their father was, who their father would\u2019ve wanted them to be. Adam, do you know, scientifically, how this is grounded in our psyches? Yeah. Well, maybe. It\u2019s a strange way for us to be, but how does it work? I wish I had a good answer to that. I will tell you that long before I read the research on it, we had a close family member, Jeff Zaslow, who was killed in a killed in a car accident. And I had a really hard time just dealing with how something so horrible and senseless could happen to someone so good. And Allison, my wife, has a background in psychiatry, and she was the one who taught me to consider how things could be worse. And I had the same reaction at the time that Sheryl did, like, \u201CThis is one of the most awful things that could happen to a person, to a family. How can you imagine it being worse?\u201D And after that, I got really curious about \u2014 \u201CHow does that work?\u201D And I think there\u2019s an evolutionary story to be told about it, which is that we\u2019re wired to pay attention to bad things. Like, prehistorically, if you see something moving in the jungle, and you\u2019re like, \u201CHuh, it\u2019s orange with black stripes and sharp things coming out of its mouth, I wonder if that could be a tiger,\u201D you would die. Whereas, if you were immediately were like, \u201CTiger. Run,\u201D you would live and sort of survive and pass on your genes. I think because of that, a lot of times bad is stronger than good. And when something bad happens, it\u2019s really hard to replace the negative thoughts with positive ones. And so it\u2019s almost like the \u2014 thinking about how things could be worse, it\u2019s a trick that we use to capture our attention because we\u2019re so good at focusing on what\u2019s going wrong that then we can sort of take advantage of that wiring as opposed to trying to work against it. And Sheryl, as you said, you have drawn \u2014 both of you \u2014 you\u2019ve drawn on a lot of data but also a lot of other stories. I mean, there\u2019s a chapter called \u201CThe Elephant in the Room.\u201D But what strikes me about that also is \u2014 and I think probably starting with that first Facebook post you wrote 30 days after Dave\u2019s death \u2014 it\u2019s not just that the elephant is in the room but that you realize that unfathomable grief and loss are all around \u2014 walking around in all kinds of lives all around us. Did that take you to something\u2026 Absolutely. Because you tell so many stories of things then people share with you or that you learn or that you see or take in in a different way. No, absolutely. What happens is that when bad things happen, we deal with the repercussions of that, the grief, the loss, the cancer treatments, the chemotherapy, the nausea, the financial hardship of a parent going to prison. But then we also deal with all of the things that come from silence, isolation, lack of support, in many cases, shame. If you want to silence a room, get diagnosed with cancer. No one knows what to say. And you\u2019re right that there is a lot of adversity and a lot of hardship all around us. And it is not quiet in a room. It is an elephant, and it is following us. And what it does is it cuts us off from the human connection we need to get through things when we most need it. And I realize having been on the other side of this, I got this wrong many times. If I had a friend \u2014 and I\u2019ve had many friends who have been diagnosed with cancer over the years \u2014 I used to say, \u201CI know you\u2019re going to get through it.\u201D And I would say it once, and not mention it again. OK. So what\u2019s wrong with that? A lot. They don\u2019t know they\u2019re going to get through it. So when I say, \u201CI know you\u2019re going to get through it,\u201D what I\u2019m actually doing \u2014 I thought I was being hopeful. But what I was really doing was not acknowledging the state they\u2019re in, because the little voice in their head is saying, \u201CYou don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get through it. I don\u2019t know.\u201D And then I would never mention it again because I thought if I brought it up I was reminding them they had cancer. Losing Dave taught me how ludicrous that was. You can\u2019t remind me I lost Dave. I know that. So when no one says anything, I just feel alone. It\u2019s not that I forget. And so now what I do if someone gets diagnosed with cancer \u2014 and unfortunately, this has happened many times since I lost Dave \u2014 I will say to them, \u201CI know you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to get through this, and I don\u2019t know either. But you\u2019re not going to go through it alone. I\u2019m here to help you. I\u2019m here to do it with you.\u201D And then the next time I see them, I will ask them, \u201CHow are you feeling?\u201D Not, \u201CHow are you?\u201D but, \u201CHow are you feeling? How is it going? Do you want to talk about this?\u201D And sometimes they do, and sometimes they don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t let the silence overtake our relationship. It\u2019s so helpful. You also have this stunning sentence from somebody named Mitch Carmody. \u201COur child dies a second time when no one speaks their name.\u201D Yeah. That was \u2014 one of the things that happened in the months after Dave passed away was people started sending all sorts of stories and interviews and quotes and poems. And Sheryl shared a lot of the most moving and meaningful ones with a group of family and friends, which I think really helped us know what she was going through. And I know I was stopped cold when I read this. This was from a father who lost a child and found that afterward people were afraid to mention it, same thing that Sheryl was talking about. They didn\u2019t want to remind him, and he wanted more than anything to remember his child. And that means we have to have the conversation. You can listen again and share this conversation with Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a frank and vulnerable conversation with Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg, and Wharton psychologist Adam Grant. After Sheryl\u2019s husband David Goldberg died suddenly at 47, she found great comfort and guidance in Adam\u2019s friendship and his research into resilience. They\u2019ve just launched Option B \u2013 a book and a non-profit about the learnings that resulted. I want to read a paragraph from the book just because I feel like so many important, really practical tools have just been laid out, but here\u2019s another scenario you described. You said, \u201CPeople continually avoided the subject. I went to a close friend\u2019s house for dinner\u201D \u2014 and obviously, I know you\u2019re not saying that anybody means to be doing \u2014 this is just that we are \u2014 we have to learn, right? Anyway. \u201CPeople continually avoided the subject. I went to a close friend\u2019s house for dinner, and she and her husband made small talk the entire time. I listened, mystified, keeping my thoughts to myself. \u2018You\u2019re right. The Warriors are totally crushing it. And you know who really loved that team? Dave.\u2019 I got emails from friends asking me to fly to their cities to speak at their events without acknowledging that travel might be more difficult for me now. \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just an overnight? Sure, I\u2019ll see if Dave can come back to life and put the kids to bed.\u2019 I ran into friends at local parks who talked about the weather. \u2018Yes. The weather has been weird with all this rain and death.\u2019\u201D That\u2019s what it felt like. Yeah. Those are just such everyday interactions, right? Yeah. And no one meant harm by it. And I saw myself in a lot of those mis-steps that people made to me. When I saw people that I knew were facing real adversity, I would say, \u201CHow are you?\u201D figuring if they wanted to talk, they would talk. But it\u2019s so hard to bring this up. \u201CWell, how am I? OK, my husband just died. It\u2019s hard to get out of bed in the morning. I don\u2019t know how to parent my children alone. And I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019ll never feel a moment of happiness again.\u201D I mean, that\u2019s not an answer to the question, \u201CHow are you?\u201D But if you say to someone, \u201CHow are you today? I know you are suffering. If you want to talk about it, I\u2019m here,\u201D then people can bring it up. The other lesson here is \u2014 and this is another thing I really messed up before \u2014 is do something specific rather than offering to do anything. I used to do this all the time. If anyone was going through something hard, I would say, \u201CIs there anything I can do?\u201D And I meant it. I would\u2019ve done anything they asked. But if you ask that question, not on purpose, but you\u2019re kind of shifting the burden to the person who needs the help. And it\u2019s hard to ask. It\u2019s hard to ask for the big things. It\u2019s hard to ask \u2014 \u201CPlease make sure my kids and I are invited to somewhere for Thanksgiving dinner, because if it\u2019s just going to be the three of us, that\u2019s going to be unbearably sad.\u201D \u201CDon\u2019t leave us alone for the Jewish holidays for the next 20 years.\u201D You can\u2019t ask that. Or I couldn\u2019t. Even, \u201CGod, it would be so nice to have someone bring us dinner.\u201D That\u2019s hard to ask for too. My amazing colleague, Dan Levee, he and his wonderful wife, they unfortunately lost their son. And in the long time they were in the hospital with him before he passed away, he had some great examples. Friends would text him, \u201CWhat do you not want on a burger?\u201D \u201CI\u2019m in the lobby of the hospital for a hug for the next hour whether you want one or not.\u201D Those were the people who really helped. So urging people \u2014 just do something. Just do something rather than ask if you can do anything, I think, again kicks the elephant out of the room and shows people that you are there with them. You quote just one of my favorite lines, also, from Annie Dillard: \u201CHow we spend our days is how we spend our lives.\u201D Even just the ways you\u2019ve been speaking about how to talk to people \u2014 you know, the difference between the question of, \u201CHow are you?\u201D and then, \u201CHow are you today?\u201D Because how we spend our days is how we spend our lives, those, I think, are tools for our working life, right? With our colleagues as well as friends or people we know outside of work. I always thought that what mattered most in our work in our lives was the big moments, the day you got a promotion, the major success, the project that really helped other people. And in our personal lives, your wedding day, and when you get to welcome your first child. And of course, those moments are incredibly meaningful and memorable. But when I started, I guess, learning more about the evidence as a psychologist, I was struck that it\u2019s actually not the intensity of your positive experiences; it\u2019s the frequency that really matters for how much happiness you find in life. And that has pretty big implications for thinking about how you plan your life, right? It\u2019s not actually the big moments that matter most. It\u2019s what Tim Urban the blogger says is the joy you find on hundreds of forgettable Wednesdays. And of course, it would be great to make all those Wednesdays less forgettable, but it\u2019s actually those daily moments of joy that really matter. And one of the things that I learned from Sheryl\u2019s experience is how hard it is to rediscover joy when something horrible happens that turns your life upside down. And the idea of giving yourself permission just to feel joy again. I remember Sheryl saying, \u201CHow can I be happy? I don\u2019t deserve to be happy. Dave is gone.\u201D To say, \u201CWell, actually, that\u2019s the last thing that Dave would want is for you to continue to be miserable.\u201D After Dave died \u2014 I think it was about four months later \u2014 I was at a friend\u2019s bar mitzvah, and a childhood friend pulled me onto the dance floor to dance to a song I loved in childhood. And a minute in, I just burst into tears. I mean, it was embarrassing. I had to be kind of ushered out of the room really quickly. And I didn\u2019t really know what was wrong. And then I realized what was wrong was I felt OK. I felt OK. For one minute four months later, I felt happy. And I felt so guilty feeling happy. And the very next day, I was in Washington. My kids and I went to visit Adam and Allison and their kids. And I told Adam the story, and he looked at me and said, \u201COf course you haven\u2019t felt happy. You don\u2019t do a single thing that would make anyone happy since Dave died. You don\u2019t do a thing.\u201D He said, \u201CYou\u2019re waiting to feel better to do something that will make you happy, but really it goes the other way. And what he said was, \u201CLet\u2019s talk about what you do. You go to work, you take care of your kids, you write in your journal, and cry. Those are all important things, but you have to give yourself permission to watch TV, play a game, even these little things.\u201D And that the big a-ha of \u2014 I think I was waiting to feel better to feel happy. Well, I couldn\u2019t go out to dinner with anyone because I might cry, or I couldn\u2019t watch a TV show because it would remind me of Dave. You actually find happiness in the small things by taking those steps. I started watching TV again. I started watching Game of Thrones again. I decided I was going to take things back. My kids and I would take things back. One day, I took Settlers of Catan off the shelf \u2014 Dave, last time I saw him, we were playing that game. That was the game the four of us played all the time. And I looked at my kids, and I said, \u201CWho wants to play?\u201D And they just looked up and said, \u201CWe do. We haven\u2019t played in so long.\u201D And then, my daughter went for gray, to be gray, and Dave was always gray. And my son said, \u201CYou can\u2019t be gray. That was Daddy\u2019s color.\u201D And she said, \u201CBut I want to be gray.\u201D And I said, \u201CYes, you can because we\u2019re going to take it back. We\u2019re going to be gray \u2014 you\u2019re going to play gray in Daddy\u2019s honor.\u201D And we took it back. We took back Catan. We took back gray. I took back Game of Thrones. We took back Scrabble. We took back cheering for the sports teams Dave loved. And it actually \u2014 those little things add up, not just to moments of happiness, but because you can have moments of happiness, moments of strength. And the thing is, I really needed permission. I felt guilty. I felt guilty. And this is a common reaction to adversity. Someone dies \u2014 even when we had nothing to do with the death, we have survivor guilt. Someone loses their job, other people, if you didn\u2019t lose didn\u2019t lose your job \u2014 \u201CHow can I be happy when my friend\u2019s lost their job?\u201D Someone goes to prison \u2014 \u201CI have my freedom; how can I be happy?\u201D And along with all the hardship that we face, this guilt is a thief of joy. My brother-in-law, in an unbelievably generous move, called me months after Dave died crying \u2014 I could hear it in his voice \u2014 saying, \u201CAll Dave ever wanted was for you to be happy. Don\u2019t take that away from him in death.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and psychologist Adam Grant. I want to talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve learned about \u2014 let me just say \u2014 the story of you coming home from vacation to tell them that their father had died. I mean, it\u2019s heartbreaking. It\u2019s unimaginable. But you also experience your children, not just enduring, but moving through life. And it feels to me like this notion of resilience also changes the way you think about parenting qualitatively. This idea \u2014 \u201Cit isn\u2019t about having a backbone, about strengthening the muscles around our backbone.\u201D I wonder if both of you could say a little bit about that. I mean, you\u2019re both parents. But Sheryl, you start. I mean, that was \u2014 there were so many truly horrible moments. People have asked me what was the worst moment. There\u2019s a lot of competition for that slot, right? Finding Dave, telling my kids, burying him, like, there are so many bad moments. But even with very stiff competition, the moment I sat down on that couch with my parents and my sister to tell my kids they would never see their father again, it is unimaginable, even for me, even having lived through it. And the screaming, and the wailing, and \u2014 what happened was horrible. And then I think maybe an hour in, my son looked at me and said, \u201CThank you, Mommy, for being here to tell me yourself.\u201D And then when I put my kids to bed that night, my daughter looked at me and said, \u201CI don\u2019t just feel bad for us; I feel bad for Grandma Paula and Uncle Rob because they lost him too.\u201D And I thought about how in the very, very worst moments of their lives, my kids were able to think about other people. And that gave me hope. I marvel at their resilience. I absolutely marvel. My kids and I were just talking about what to do this Father\u2019s Day. There are these days on the calendar that just \u2014 it never occurred to me how painful Father\u2019s Day must be for millions of families, and now I know. And so months in advance, we\u2019re right now trying to get through yet another Father\u2019s Day, and my son said, \u201CThis time, why don\u2019t we go have fun? All day, we\u2019ll have fun, just like Daddy would\u2019ve wanted.\u201D It\u2019s incredible. And you also have written that you \u2014 you stopped worrying in the same way when setbacks and disappointments come into your kids\u2019 lives, that you understand\u2026 Oh, my god. Yeah. When we\u2019re having a normal kid problem \u2014 \u201CI didn\u2019t do well on a test.\u201D \u201CAll my friends made the soccer team \u2014 the advance soccer team, and I didn\u2019t.\u201D \u201CMy lunch spilled in the water, and I had nothing to eat.\u201D That happened yesterday. I am just over-flooded with relief. I\u2019m like, \u201COh, a normal kid problem. This is not death.\u201D Literally, I\u2019m relieved. Those problems that seemed so big before are tiny and small and completely surmountable. And it\u2019s not just me \u2014 I\u2019m not the only one with this perspective. My kids have it. A few weeks ago, my son\u2019s basketball team lost in the playoffs, and all the other kids were super upset. And I looked at my son, and I said, \u201CHow are you?\u201D And he looked at me, and he goes, \u201CMom, this is 6th grade basketball. I\u2019m fine.\u201D Right. I would never wish that perspective on anyone, especially my child. But he does have it, and it is a form of post-traumatic growth, and it is a valuable life lesson. Adam, how do you \u2014 I mean, you also carry around all this data and this research, and you\u2019re always immersed in it. How do you \u2014 do you apply that to your life as a parent? Yeah. I\u2019ve always wanted to be one of those psychologists who doesn\u2019t screw up my children. So\u2026 Oh my god. Adam has the greatest children. They are the cutest, sweetest, smartest \u2014 they\u2019re adorable. No comment, but\u2026 So you try not to have them as research subjects and guinea pigs. Yeah. As much as possible. But I will say the thing that psychology has underscored for me is just how important it is for kids to know that they matter. And mattering is \u2014 it\u2019s a really basic but important idea that, I think, as parents, a lot of us lose sight of, that kids need to know that other people notice them, care about them, and even rely on them. And that just becomes all the more important in the face of hardship. When you\u2019re feeling that isolation that Sheryl was describing, that lack of control, to know that other people are paying attention to you, that they\u2019re involving you in conversations, that they\u2019re letting you make some choices, and even sometimes seeking your advice is so important. And this is one of the things that Allison and I have spent a lot of time on with our kids is just making sure that they have a say in the big decisions that we make and the small ones too. And that is a source of strength because that means they don\u2019t end up constantly looking to adults for direction every time there\u2019s a decision to make or every time something difficult happens they know that they can rely on their own judgment. And I think that is one of the most striking things for me \u2014 just looking back to that first time I went to dinner with Sheryl and Dave and their kids is how many questions they asked their children, but also how they taught their children to ask questions of other people. I guess that\u2019s modeling, showing other people that they matter. And I think that that\u2019s such an important skill that probably we could all do a better job at teaching as parents. Adam, I\u2019m also curious about the connection of this kind of collection of things we\u2019re talking about, resilience, adversity, and to your work on giving and originality. As you\u2019ve lived this in friendship with Sheryl, and in your research, how does resilience flow into those things \u2014 generosity, originality, creativity? It\u2019s really been at the heart of a lot of my work. I spent a lot of my career studying why givers burn out, what happens when generous people exhaust themselves, or just when no good deed goes unpunished. And what you need in that situation more than anything else is the strength to persevere. You need places to find energy, to rejuvenate your motivation. And as far as originality is concerned, I don\u2019t know a creative person who has not faced just extreme rejection and failure and disappointment over and over and over again. And the ability to persist, to keep trying, to try new ideas, new ways of solving problems, is one of the strongest forces that drives whether people are able to move the world around them. And so I guess I\u2019ve come to think of resilience as a critical skill for living a meaningful life and for living it according to your own values. And I think I\u2019m now much more aware of that than I was before. Yeah, I actually wanted to kind of come to a close with the notion of wisdom, which is connected to a meaningful life. And which, it seems to me, throughout your writing, it\u2019s that resilience is also a building block of wisdom as much as it is healing and kind of surviving and flourishing. Wisdom can be connected to things like knowledge and accomplishment, certainly, but those are things you can point at. You can point at somebody and say, \u201CThey\u2019re knowledgeable. They\u2019re intelligent. They\u2019re accomplished.\u201D But that the measure of wisdom is the imprint that a life makes on other lives around it. And I thought of that, Adam, when I was reading something you wrote about Dave. After his death, you said, \u201CI don\u2019t believe this happened for a reason, but it has given us all a reason to be more present parents, more loving spouses, more supportive friends, and more caring leaders. The overwhelming sentiment from everyone who knew Dave is that he inspired us to be better human beings, and he had that effect on us throughout his life, long before we lost him.\u201D Yeah. I \u2014 gosh, there\u2019s very little to add to that. I will just say that Dave was extraordinary in many ways. And he just saw the good in everyone, and he went out of his way to be a friend to so many people. And I guess my hope is that that comes through in the way that Sheryl has gone on to help people with the wisdom that she gained, that she never wanted to gain, but she did. And I think that\u2019s a beautiful thing. There\u2019s this\u2026 Well, one thing\u2026 Yeah, go on. Sorry. One thing that\u2019s really at the heart of this book is post-traumatic growth. And Adam, sharing with me the research on posttraumatic growth, which I then learned \u2014 can you grow from trauma? And you absolutely can. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019d take the growth. I\u2019d much rather have Dave and give back all the growth. But since that\u2019s not an option, we grow. We grow by strengthening. I know I\u2019m stronger than I was before because I\u2019ve lived through this, and my kids do too. We grow because we have deeper relationships, more meaning. My work at Facebook has more meaning. We grow by finding more gratitude, gratitude for my kids being alive, something that really I took for granted before. I think one of the questions we are asking in this book is, can you have pre-traumatic growth? And I absolutely think you can. I would give anything to go back and live with Dave with the sense of gratitude I have for every day that I have now. Anything. What would I have done if I had known we only had 11 years? What would I have done on that last day when we went on a hike, and he walked with the guys, and I walked with the girls? If I could go back and share with him the gratitude I feel now, that would be incredible, but I can\u2019t. But what I can do is try to live my life going forward with that gratitude and other people who haven\u2019t experienced trauma can get that gratitude now. Two months ago, my cousin Laura turned 50, and I called her the morning of her birthday, and I said, \u201CLaura, I\u2019m calling to say happy birthday, but I\u2019m also calling \u2018cause \u2014 in case you woke up this morning with that, \u2018Oh my god. I\u2019m 50. I\u2019m getting old\u2019 thing we all do, I want to tell you that I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re 50 because this is the year that Dave won\u2019t turn 50. And it turns out \u2014 I\u2019d never thought about this before, but there\u2019s only two options: we either grow older, or we don\u2019t. And it is an honor and privilege to turn 50, and I am so grateful that you are alive and in my life.\u201D And I used to roll my eyes at birthdays and either not celebrate them, or \u201COh my god, I\u2019m getting old.\u201D If I get to grow old, I will be so grateful. And that gratitude, with all the sadness that still lingers, makes my life deeper, richer, meaningful, and in some ways, has a different kind of meaning and joy.
