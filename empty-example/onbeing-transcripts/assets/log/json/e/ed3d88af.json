  "fullText": "Many of my critics would be quite happy for me to stop calling myself a Buddhist. And even some of those who like my work feel that the Buddhism gets in the way. But I disagree profoundly with that. The rootedness in tradition is central to me, and I see Buddhist tradition \u2014 I suspect like other traditions, also \u2014 as not something which is static and fixed and somehow preserved in formaldehyde, but it is something that is alive. Stephen Batchelor\u2019s \u201Csecular Buddhism\u201D speaks to the mystery and vitality of spiritual life in every form. For him, secularism opens to doubt and questioning as a radical basis for spiritual life. Above all, Stephen Batchelor understands Buddhism without transcendent beliefs like karma or reincarnation to become something urgent to do, not to believe in. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Stephen Batchelor is the author of numerous books, including The Faith to Doubt, Confession of a Buddhist Atheist and, most recently, After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for a Secular Age. He grew up near London and traveled to India in the early \u201870s where, he has often written, he was immediately captured by Buddhism. He spent a decade as an ordained monk, living, studying, and writing in Tibetan Buddhist and Zen communities in Asia. You know, I feel that all the way through your writing, you talk about doubt and questioning as a radical basis for spiritual life. And I get curious, as I see that as such a thread in you and through your work, about whether you trace the roots of that, that reverence for doubt and questioning, or a sense of the primacy of that, into however you would describe the religious or spiritual background of your early life. Mm-hmm. I grew up in a sort of humanist background. My family had long departed from any active involvement in the church, so I didn\u2019t have any religious education. I never went to any religious services. And, in some ways, I never really asked those kinds of questions that religion would address. I grew up as a child who I think was quite sensitive, and I was further sensitized by the fact that I grew up in a single-parent family\u2026 Yeah. \u2026which at the time was\u2026 Also very\u2026 \u2026very unusual. So I did feel different. And I attributed a lot of that to not growing up with a father. And this made me perhaps more introverted than I already was. And I do recall being at school, for example, and wondering why the teachers never addressed the quality of our own subjectivity \u2014 in other words, the kind of anxiety that I became aware of quite early on that struck me as both troubling and yet somehow taboo. It wasn\u2019t something you talked about. Right. Perhaps if I\u2019d gone to Sunday school or church, these issues would have been addressed. But I was thrown back on a kind of deep curiosity about what it meant to exist. And that, I guess, is perhaps lying at the roots of my own subsequent fascination with doubt, with questioning, with astonishment, with wonder as the very, very root of what we call \u201Cspirituality\u201D or \u201Creligion.\u201D I also remember lying awake at night as a child and wondering why I couldn\u2019t stop the incessant outpouring of thoughts and chatter. The mind seemed endlessly restless. And that, perhaps, was a foretaste of what I would subsequently know as meditation. Yes. Tell me, when you say you were immediately drawn, captured by Buddhism, and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026immediately converted, and drawn in, and really gave yourself, your life, over to it in Dharamshala and thereafter, how do you describe what captured you, what you discovered there? I think what impressed me most was the presence of the Tibetan people, who had only recently gone into exile, about 12 years before. And I\u2019d never met people like that before. People who were living in great poverty, great, enormous distress, and yet had within them a kind of a stillness, a kind of radiance, in a way. And not just the lamas, but the ordinary people. I was immensely moved by that. I\u2019d never come across it in England, in Europe, where I\u2019d grown up. And at the same time, I\u2019m also aware that there was a high degree of romanticism, idealization, perhaps \u2014 it allowed certain deep longings to come to the surface \u2026 You mean in yourself, you were \u2026 In myself. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I was drawn \u2014 I was just so \u2014 I was completely \u2014 I fell in love with it. Yeah, right. I think intellectually, as well, right? I mean\u2026 Yes. \u2026the theology, the worldview, the richness of the tradition. That\u2019s right. Fortunately, I think, given my disposition, I landed in one of the Tibetan communities where the Buddhism was not so much about mystical experience or mandalas and all those things, but it was a very rigorous intellectual critical tradition. That, too, engaged me. I wasn\u2019t being presented with something I just had to blindly believe. Yeah. Although, it is interesting to me that you did connect with particular intensity to Tibetan Buddhism, and then to Zen. And in the spectrum of Buddhism, those are the traditions. Certainly the Tibetan tradition has a very developed supernatural \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you could use different words for that, but\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026world of heavens and hells and\u2026 Yes. \u2026and a reincarnated leader. And Zen also has very, very mystical aspects. So it\u2019s kind of interesting to me given that you now \u2014 you are a voice for what you call \u201Csecular Buddhism,\u201D or\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026your Buddhist atheism. But that\u2019s really where you are rooted in Buddhism to begin with. I think I realized when I got to Dharamshala that there was a whole experience of human life that I\u2019d been excluded from as a child. As I said, I hadn\u2019t gone to church, I\u2019d not been raised in that milieu, and I think, at some level, I had missed that. And so the exotic aspects of Tibetan Buddhism\u00A0\u2014 its mystical, rather metaphysical teachings, again, filled a void within me. And so initially, I was very drawn to that whole side of the dharma. But at the same time \u2014 and this, I think, operated as a constant tension through my training \u2014 was the rather unconscious attraction to the metaphysics, the mysticism \u2014 but constantly I would return back to the emphasis on reason, on the emphasis on mental and intellectual clarity. The two coexist quite happily in the Tibetan world, and at a certain point, I think I got the religious thing, somehow, out of my system a bit. And I came back, perhaps, to the sort of humanism in which I\u2019d been raised, and yet now infused with a kind of Buddhist spirituality. Right. There\u2019s a place in your writing where you describe \u2014 I think you say that it\u2019s the closest thing you might describe having to a \u201Cmystical\u201D experience\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026in Dharamshala. And I love the way you talk about it. You said, \u201Cit gave no answers. It only revealed the massiveness of the question.\u201D Yes. Now that\u2019s the point that, in a way, questioning became, for me, the real prime source of my practice and my life. And it was an experience that came upon me. And I don\u2019t hesitate to use the word \u201Cmystical.\u201D It was not something for which I had been at all prepared. I was walking in a woodland, and suddenly I was just overwhelmed by the sheer surprise that this was happening at all. And it struck with me a \u2014 it was like a visceral blow to the whole body. It was a deeply emotional opening to life in a way I\u2019d never even suspected before. And yet it wasn\u2019t presented to me as a set of solutions or answers to human questions. But, rather, it exposed what I still feel to be the utter primacy of the questioning, the doubting. But it\u2019s not an intellectual thing. It seizes one\u2019s whole body-mind with an undeniable sense of power, really. And I\u2019ve pursued that ever since. And that still animates my practice very much today. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with \u201Csecular Buddhist\u201D Stephen Batchelor. And you use the language of \u201Ccoming out\u201D as a secular Buddhist. Talk a little bit about that, why it feels that way. And I guess that\u2019s also a reflection on the reactions you received \u2014 you\u2019ve received across the years. Yeah, I\u2019ve \u2014 since I started writing, I\u2019ve toyed with a number of terms to try to describe the kind of Buddhism that I\u2019m trying to articulate. I\u2019ve used the word \u201Cexistential,\u201D I\u2019ve used the word \u201Cagnostic,\u201D \u201Catheist,\u201D and now I\u2019m exploring the implications of this sense of \u201Csecular.\u201D OK. What I\u2019m looking for is a way to recover what I think is very much at the heart of the Buddhist tradition that I don\u2019t think is \u201Creligious\u201D in the sense of a formal religious set of beliefs and practices. But, once again, goes back to seeking a language to address these primary questions. And I feel, in many ways, the approach of what we might understand is the teaching of the historical Buddha is in some ways closer to Hellenistic philosophies, say, the skeptics, or the Epicureans, or the Stoics, who, again, we don\u2019t think of as religious, but nonetheless these were communities of men and women who took these sorts of questions with utmost seriousness, and developed a way of thinking, a way of practicing, a way of living together communally that, to me, resonate very closely with the early Buddhist communities around Gautama. And so, what I\u2019m seeking is both to recover something of the early tradition, and to not assume that it need take an overtly religious form, but can find a voice that speaks to us in our secular \u2014 in an utterly secular condition. That may not be the language I\u2019ll continue using but I do find it\u2019s useful. And I also find it gets a very \u2014 people respond to that. I just want to put it out there, and I know you are very aware of this, yourself, that there\u2019s a very loud echo in the way your \u2014 I don\u2019t want to call it a \u201Ccritique\u201D of Buddhism \u2014 but the way you are reexamining Buddhism, with movements in monotheistic tradition, and certainly Christianity, and the language you use about looking at the canon, \u201Cexcavating\u201D the discourses and the life of Buddha \u2014 a historical, critical analysis of text and tradition. I mean, there\u2019s a long tradition of that in Christianity. So, how would you begin to tell or retell the story of who the Buddha was, what he was like, and how the distinction you see between this historical Buddha and the Buddha that you are uncovering? OK. Well, I have, as you seem to suggest, been strongly influenced by movements within Christian theology. I think we are offered extraordinarily helpful tools to apply a similar understanding of the Buddha, his early teachings. And Buddhism does present the Buddha as an almost divine, god-like figure with rather peculiar physical characteristics. It presents the Buddhist teaching as a very well-worked-out, quite sophisticated metaphysical theory with different realms of existence and reincarnation and so forth and so on. But when you go back to the text that our \u2014 the earliest source we have that predate the arising of the different Buddhist schools, the different orthodoxies and so on, we start to get a rather different sense of what\u2019s going on. The Pali Canon, which is the earliest collection we have to work with \u2014 when you read these texts, you really find yourself in a very human world. The Buddha and his followers, the different kings and other figures he interacts with, inhabit a quirky, rather tawdry human world that is very much like the world that we know today. And you find that so many of the Buddha\u2019s teachings are not stated as kind of final, dogmatic truths, but they emerge in the interactions he has with the people of his time. So the more that I\u2019ve delved into this, the more I find that the carapace of the divinization of the Buddha, the metaphysical theories, begins to somehow fall away, and one recovers a deeply human setting, and a deeply human discourse. Here are some things you\u2019ve said about the Buddha: \u201CWhat is truly original in the Buddha\u2019s teaching, I discovered, was his secular outlook.\u201D Or here, you said, \u201CThe genius of the Buddha lay in his imagination.\u201D So, open those statements up for me. Well, I have been criticized \u2014 and I think it\u2019s a legitimate criticism \u2014 that, am I perhaps simply finding what I\u2019m already looking for? Do I\u2026 Which is a human inclination after all. Yeah. One of those quirky\u2026 It is. \u2026things about us, right? It is. Yeah. So, yeah, I do have to be cautious and careful in not simply projecting my own, preformed ideas of what Buddhism is, and then miraculously finding that in the Buddha\u2019s teaching. So I\u2019m aware of those criticisms. But, as you suggest, this is a natural, human way to enter into a dialogue with these texts. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m not interested in separating myself from these discourses by some kind of scientific objectivity that pretends to somehow see things in a cold, clinical way. These discourses are engaging for me because they speak to me. And I think this has always been the case. In every situation where Buddhism has gone into another culture, be it China, Tibet, Japan, it speaks to the needs of those people at those times, and enters a kind of dialogue. And, obviously, the passages, the teachings that speak to those people are the ones that meet their particular needs at their time. Yeah. And the power of Buddhism to somehow survive is not because it\u2019s preserved a certain, fixed set of dogmas or whatever, but actually has managed again and again to reinvent itself. In other words, Buddhism\u2019s survival has to do with the capacity it has to trigger imaginative transformations amongst those who are drawn to and engage with its ideas and with its practices. So, what\u2019s going on in modernity is really no different in principle to what went on when it encountered the shamanistic culture of Tibet \u2014 and Tibetan Buddhism necessarily carries that context very visibly \u2014 or the more Taoist culture of China and Japan, which, Zen of course is very infused with that. So, in that sense, I really feel that what I\u2019m doing \u2014 and also, not just myself, but I think a whole generation of us are struggling to somehow articulate, not a cold, objective account of what the Buddha was or said, but what his teachings somehow have to say to us in our condition, how they address the needs of our own suffering humanity. Yeah. You talk about \u2014 here\u2019s something you said. \u201CJust as Christianity has struggled to explain how an essentially good and loving God could have created a world with so much suffering, injustice, and horror, so Buddhism has struggled to account for the presence of joy, delight, and enchantment in a world that is supposedly nothing but a vale of tears.\u201D I mean, I know I\u2019ve changed the subject a little bit here, but it\u2019s\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026it\u2019s another way of struggling to get at the heart of what\u2019s going on in the tradition. No, that\u2019s right. The \u2014 I think belief is the big problem\u2026 Yeah. \u2026frankly. Not belief as a kind of hypothesis \u2014 well, maybe this is true, I\u2019ll give it a go. But belief in the sense that this is the way reality works. And that often calls upon supernaturalistic-type explanations, be they theistic, or be they the law of karma that operates over lifetimes. And this becomes increasingly the kind of public face of, let\u2019s say, Buddhism. Religion caters to people\u2019s need for security. We do live in a highly contingent, unpredictable, changing, tragic world. And religion provides us with some sort of stable basis on which we can begin to make sense of all of that. So I don\u2019t \u2014 and I recognize that such consolation is, of course, much needed in our world. But I think that\u2019s achieved at the cost of somehow obscuring what is radical, what is original, what is, perhaps, deeply unsettling\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026in what the Buddha\u2019s saying. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t think the Buddha is actually interested in offering us a consolatory view of the world that will just make us better able to cope with our lives. I think he really wants us to deeply engage with our lives without premising that engagement on certain non-negotiable beliefs. Yeah. And one of the things that you point out is also that when we try to reduce these traditions to belief, it actually distances people from the immediacy of the mystery of life. Mm-hmm. And you talk about how Korean Zen also actually cultivates \u2014 and Zen, in particular, cultivates virtues of perplexity and astonishment and wonderment, and in fact, doubt. That\u2019s right. So that at the heart of the tradition itself there is a contrast to that, that dynamic you\u2019re describing. That\u2019s absolutely right. And I suspect the same is also true in Christianity when you go back to the actual life of Jesus and what he struggled with in his life. But Zen was a movement that emerged in China about a thousand or more years after the Buddha. And I think it actually sought, again, to rebel against these consoling certainties of scholarship and belief, and return to what the Buddha\u2019s own experience was when he left, supposedly, this luxurious life he was brought up in, and goes outside the palace, sees a sick person, an aging person, a corpse. That\u2019s where the existential question, the sense of mystery, the sense of astonishment, the sense of deep, deep curiosity and bafflement begin. And his awakening I can only understand as some kind of resolution to those primary existential questions. And Zen seeks to recover that. Buddhism tends to become a set of answers to these questions, and the questions then slowly, but perhaps inevitably, slip away and get forgotten. So Zen comes back. And the great attraction to me to Zen Buddhism, after my time with the Tibetans, was precisely this recovery of this primacy of questioning. And so our meditations in Korea were \u2014 for three months, twice a year, we would just sit in a darkened room, and ask ourselves, what is this? And rest with that question. Nothing else. I loved it. It was marvelous. So, I mean, I know that the nature of what we\u2019re talking about defies words, but can you speak a little bit more about that experience? What is it? What is it? Well, first of all, the words, the form of words \u2014 and they could just as well be \u201CWho am I?\u201D or \u2014 \u201CWhat is this\u201D starts out as a form of words. You repeat it to yourself when your mind has achieved a degree of stillness and quiet, in a more meditative frame. But once the words begin to sink in, once this question becomes a kind of, almost a physical sensation, it begins to infuse your whole body-mind. At that point, you can let go of the actual form of words and you can focus far more on simply infusing your consciousness of whatever is going on in that moment with this deep sense of curiosity, puzzlement, bafflement, it\u2019s so difficult to find the right word. Yeah. But it is really about opening up to life as profoundly mysterious. And rather than trying to solve that mystery, it\u2019s actually about penetrating that mystery. And when you penetrate a mystery, it doesn\u2019t become less mysterious. It becomes, if anything, more mysterious. So this source of questioning and doubt is something that, as you go into it, only intensifies. Only becomes, in a sense, more pronounced. But that doesn\u2019t lead you into a kind of a chaotic bafflement. It actually becomes a still, I think, rather serene relationship that you begin to cultivate with life as such, that everything, every detail of life, every person you meet, every situation you find yourself in, is one that, in a sense, is deeply surprising, deeply odd. It lets go of your habitual views and opinions about this, that, or the other, have less firm ground to stand on. I don\u2019t even know if this fits, but I have to say, when I read you and hear you talking about surprise, I was thinking about the great rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. Do you \u2014 are you familiar with Heschel at all? I\u2019ve \u2014 not really. I\u2019m aware of who he is, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2026 I think he also \u2014 he talked about depth theology, and he also had this sense of mystery at the core, which in itself was orthodox and also, in its way, challenged everything that is orthodox. Mm-hmm. Both at the same time. And he would talk about surprise as a spiritual virtue, right? So here\u2019s something he said. \u201CI would say about individuals, an individual dies when he ceases to be surprised. I am surprised every morning that I see the sun shine again. When I see an act of evil, I\u2019m not accommodated\u2026 I\u2019m still surprised. That\u2019s why I\u2019m against it, why I can hope against it. We must learn how to be surprised. Not to adjust ourselves. I am the most maladjusted person in society.\u201D Which is really what you\u2019re saying about \u2014 the Buddha also did not \u2014 that there\u2019s something \u2014 that a part of what these traditions are for is to unsettle us in ways that\u2026 Yes. \u2026that we need. Yeah. That quotation is wonderful. I\u2019ve not heard it before. But that\u2019s exactly what \u2014 he says it far better than I can say it. I think that is just wonderful. I remember, also, after my experience in the forest in Dharamshala, I found very little in Indian Buddhist, Tibetan Buddhist texts that really spoke of this. I was kind of surprised, as it were. And that led me to actually seek insight as to what had gone on in me at that point in non-Buddhist traditions. And one of the first texts that really spoke to me in this way was Martin Buber\u2019s I and Thou. Again, this is famous because of this relationship, the centrality of this relationship. But there are other passages in that book in which he, too, taps into this deep sense of puzzlement, astonishment, surprise. I found it also in the work of the Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel. I found it in Heidegger. I find \u2014 and then you find it even in Socrates. \u201CThe source of philosophy is wonder.\u201D And I was rather uncomfortable with the fact the Buddhism that I was engaged with at that point didn\u2019t seem to have much room for that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that I was drawn into Zen, because they emphasize it, make it very much the central point. And an emphasis that you, I feel, are just living more and more passionately into in your work is, then, this enlivening interplay that might seem counterintuitive on the outside. Mm-hmm. You know, you say, above all, \u201Csecular Buddhism is something to do, not to believe in.\u201D Yes. It\u2019s a lived\u2026 Yes. \u2026piety. It\u2019s creating the conditions whereby we can embark on a way of life that is not dictated by our instinctive reactivity, our habits, our fears, and so forth and so on, but stems from an openness, an inner openness, that is unconditioned by those forces, and that allows the freedom to think differently, to act differently, to respond more fully. And in doing so, to allow the human person to flourish. To realize more fully the potentials that each one of us has. You can listen again and share this conversation with Stephen Batchelor through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, exploring the secular Buddhism of teacher and writer Stephen Batchelor. For him, secularism opens to the perplexity, astonishment, and mystery of living in this world. His re-imagining of this vast tradition echoes the way every great tradition cherishes \u201Cquestions that probe ever deeper into what is still unknown.\u201D I\u2019m so aware at this moment in time that, somehow, I feel we are, and I would even use the word \u201Cevolving,\u201D as a species with \u2014 and science as a companion in this, and spiritual life in all its modern fluidity is part of this. And, yet, it\u2019s such a paradoxical moment, because when you talk about this quality of non-reactive stillness, not as an end in itself, but as a way that can lead us into a way of flourishing, can be discerning and directive of the right action, right living, which is a Buddhist phrase. So much of culture conspires against non-reactive stillness. Not necessarily maliciously, but I\u2019m talking about how we are struggling to kind of live with these technologies. And also looking at the world writ large, and non-reactive stillness is the opposite of the reaction to, a terrorist attack in Paris, or things that happen closer to home that are less dramatic but equally devastating. You know what I mean? We\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s such a complicated\u2026 Yes. No\u2026 \u2026time. Mm-hmm. No, I completely agree. We live in a world where we\u2019re bombarded with information, that we are pressed to produce and to achieve in a way that\u2019s almost violent, at times. At the same time, though, what has really surprised me in my 40 years of involvement in Buddhism is the sudden embracing in the mainstream culture of the practice of mindfulness. Yeah. Now, this, of course, is an essential Buddhist meditation that, until recently, was practiced by a handful of people, like myself, in India or in retreat centers. And suddenly it\u2019s become mainstream. Now, what\u2019s going on here? This is a movement that, in its very essence, is questioning this frenzy of activity that our culture is so embedded in. I think it\u2019s, in a sense, timely that people are looking for something like a non-reactive stillness, if that word is helpful. And mindfulness allows them the very simple possibility of stopping, just pausing, opening up a gap in their thoughts and their feelings. And this, I think, is perhaps arising at this time because we are becoming conscious as a community, as a society, as a human community, of this stressful overload that is so demanding and, I think, so undermining in many ways. It prevents us, I think, from really living fully. And I think people are sensitive creatures. They intuit this. They sense this. They don\u2019t want to have a life that\u2019s just dictated by these forces. So, on the one hand, yes, what the dharma is teaching, but I think this is also true in terms of most of our religious traditions \u2014 they\u2019re actually standing up to the drives of our nature, and offering another way of living. I don\u2019t think Buddhism is unique in that. But it does have methodologies, practices, that can be quite readily converted into somewhat secular forms without, I think, losing something that is essential to them. And it\u2019s quite remarkable, to the extent to which this has been picked up. I experience you also to continue to be in a very vital and creative relationship with tradition. Mm-hmm. Including the tradition that has transcendent aspects. I mean, you revere the Dalai Lama. And you speak about how much you\u2019ve learned from him across the years. But there\u2019s no greater embodiment of the supernatural belief system of Tibetan Buddhism in particular. Mm-hmm. But I sense you choosing to live in that place of relationship and even reverence for that. I mean, you\u2019ve said \u2014 Alain de Botton, who I\u2019ve also had on the show, who suggested in the future we might have atheist cathedrals. Yes. But you said you think the holy places, including the holy places of the past, are necessary and to be honored. Is that correct? That\u2019s true. I realize that sits, perhaps, for some, uncomfortably with some of the other things I write, which have a sort of secular, pared-down feel to them. But one of the things that I greatly cherish is pilgrimage. And pretty much every year for the last few years I\u2019ve been going back to India primarily and visiting these ancient sites. Buddhism, of course, no longer really exists in India. But there\u2019s some wonderful places, both those where the Buddha lived and taught. We\u2019ve now identified these places. We can visit them. And also, sites of ancient Buddhist monasteries in India, such as Ajanta, and elsewhere. And I find \u2014 particularly, perhaps, as a somewhat intellectual person \u2014 that actually, physically going to these places that carry these memories, let\u2019s say \u2014 I don\u2019t see this in a weird mystical way of vibrations or something like that. But when I find myself in these places, and I sit quietly in such places, and I bring to mind what has occurred in these places in the past, it connects me to the tradition in a nonverbal way that is somehow a kind of literal \u201Cearthing\u201D of my practice. But I must say that when I find myself trying to replicate such practices here in the modern West, it doesn\u2019t quite work in the same way. I think, nonetheless, we do need to be open to the fact that we\u2019re not just looking for a philosophy of life. We\u2019re looking to create spaces, spaces where we can come together as strangers and publicly celebrate what we value most deeply. I keep thinking of a conversation I had with the late Jaroslav Pelikan, who was just one of the great scholars\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026of Christian tradition. And, in fact, before he died, he did this monumental study of creeds across time and the globe. This gets at what\u2019s the danger of creating a new secular Buddhism, right? Because the human condition remains involved. He said, \u201Cthe only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.\u201D But what he meant by that is that tradition has this heft. I mean, it has its problems, right, to state it mildly, but it\u2019s a work of generations. And our traditions hold great beauty and wisdom. And he said you can say that you\u2019re throwing the old creed out, but as soon as you start creating that new community according to your vision, you do, in fact, start creating a new creed, and the danger is that it cannot have the gravitas or the wisdom of what came before. And is this something you think about? I think about this a lot. Many of my critics would be quite happy for me to stop calling myself a Buddhist. And even some of those who like my work feel that the Buddhism gets in the way. But I disagree profoundly with that. The rootedness in tradition is essential to me. And I see Buddhist tradition \u2014 I suspect like other traditions, also \u2014 as not something which is static and fixed and somehow preserved in formaldehyde, but it is something that is alive. And it evolves and it changes over time. I believe that that change is not something that can be speeded up with all of our modern technologies and access to information. I think of Buddhism as more like \u2026 There\u2019s not an app for that. No, not yet, although they\u2019re working on it. Right. But even the apps, which will come, no doubt \u2014 in fact, they already exist \u2014 I just think are the ways in which people can access the wisdom of these traditions in the ways that they\u2019re used to doing so many other things now. So, in some sense, I find it helpful to think of being rooted in a tradition without being stuck in a tradition. But I do feel quite passionately that we need another kind of language in order to articulate this tradition in ways that speak to our sense of modernity, or the kind of creatures we are now in a world informed so much by the natural sciences. A sense of being sentient creatures who have evolved on the surface of this planet that\u2019s spinning around the sun. This is a worldview quite different from that in which Buddhism has grown up. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with secular Buddhist Stephen Batchelor. You\u2019ve been speaking of a phrase for a while, and it\u2019s the final chapter in your book, in your newest book, After Buddhism \u2014 this notion of \u201Ca culture of awakening.\u201D And I wonder if you would talk a little bit about that. OK. This idea first sort of came to mind when I started to ask myself the question, is Buddhism a religion in the conventional sense? And if it\u2019s not a religion, then what is it? And this gave rise to the idea that it\u2019s a culture. And of course, all religions are embedded in some sort of culture, but I\u2019d like to put the emphasis more on the culture, which might have religious elements within it. But to emphasize that, that a culture is a \u2014 a culture arises out of communities that share common values and practices, and over time they generate a common sense of what matters in life, a common ethical aesthetic, philosophical sense of the world. They live communally, according to similar principles. And there is a beautiful parable in the early Buddhist texts where the Buddha sees his Eightfold Path, his way of life, as leading not to nirvana, which is the traditional view, but leading to the rebuilding of a city. And that, to me, is a very, very valuable source for thinking of Buddhism as a culture. I like to think \u2014 and again, I might be wrong\u00A0\u2014 that the Buddha was concerned not with the founding of another religion. He was concerned to establish a set of norms, which are enacted through the Eightfold Path, that would give rise to another kind of civilization. That might be rather grandiose today to seek for another civilization. But a culture, I think, is something that actually is emerging in, let\u2019s say, modernity. I think in America, particularly, when I come here to teach, and to lead courses, and so on, I become very much aware that, over the last 30, 40 years, a Buddhist culture is emerging. And it\u2019s inflecting not only formal Buddhist centers, but, also, we find it reflected in literature, in poetry, in music, in the arts in general, in philosophy. Buddhist ideas are beginning to sort of infiltrate into our wider sense of life in modernity. America\u2019s quite distinctive here. There are many prominent artists from different disciplines who self-identify\u2026 That\u2019s true. \u2026as Buddhists. And, likewise, I see this advent of mindfulness that is spreading so rapidly as another indicator of what Buddhism is providing for us. It\u2019s not a religious belief, but a kind of cultural inspiration. How that will play out, of course, we don\u2019t know, but I do feel it\u2019s almost assuming, now, a kind of unstoppable momentum. Yeah. And, actually, I wanted to read some language from your 1989 book, The Faith to Doubt, which is a wonderful book. Mm-hmm. I just want to read it because it\u2019s beautiful, but then \u2014 and I think it\u2019s a wonderful way to kind of come back to where we started. \u201CThe way of the Buddha is a living response to a living question. Yet whenever it has become institutionalized, its vital response has become a well formulated answer. The seemingly important task of preserving a particular set of answers often causes the very questions which gave rise to the answers to be forgotten. Then the lucid answers Buddhism provides are cut off from the stammering voice that asks the questions.\u201D Which is such an incisive analysis of what we do with religion in general, but is something that I think modern people are acutely aware of and working with. Yeah. No, I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s always, I find, strange to hear myself quoted back. Because I wrote that book more than 25 years ago, but I would say it in exactly the same way today. That is a thread that I think continues to run through and animate what I\u2019m doing. And I do think people are very sensitized to these questions. And, yet, we often, in our culture, don\u2019t really have a clearly formulated and expressed language, or cultural forms, as it were, that allow us to speak that language. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s a kind of taboo, in some ways, too, against these things. I\u2019m not interested, really, in establishing Buddhism as another religion in this country. I think really its reach is probably far greater than that. And as you say, it\u2019s something that you can be a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or an atheist, and these practices are just as applicable, just as accessible, just as fruitful, no matter what your sort of belief frame might be. It\u2019s also \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating that somehow it all \u2014 it continually \u2014 as much as we\u2019re \u2014 you were talking about secular Buddhism, and it also, always circles back to these layers of mystery. Yeah. Or, this is how you said it in Buddhism Without Beliefs: \u201Cquestions that probe ever deeper into what is still unknown.\u201D Yes. No, that\u2019s right. Yes, exactly. Well, I \u2014 of course I say \u201Cexactly,\u201D it\u2019s what I wrote. That\u2019s right. I want to ask you\u00A0\u2014 this is also from Buddhism Without Beliefs\u00A0\u2014 \u201CSince death alone is certain, and the time of death uncertain, what should I do?\u201D So you are bringing the way Buddhist tradition has grappled with the ancient human question back to that question \u2014 what does it mean to be human, and how do we want to live? \u2014 without the promise of something beyond this life. And you said, so again, \u201CSince death alone is certain, and the time of death uncertain, what should I do?\u201D You wrote, \u201COver time, such meditation penetrates our primary sense of being in the world at all.\u201D And I wondered if you would speak, as we close, just about \u2014 in a very concrete way, whatever that means, yesterday or today, about how this observation, this questioning, penetrates ordinary life, an ordinary day in the world, your primary sense of being in the world at all. Well, the meditation on death that you\u2019ve just read out is actually an adaptation of a Tibetan reflection on mortality. Mm-hmm. As a young man, I did this practice daily. I found, of all the Tibetan practices I did, it was the one that was most life-changing, to the extent that today, I find that my sense of being in the world is deeply infused with an awareness of how this may be my last day on Earth. And these reflections on death are not in the remotest sense morbid or gloomy. The weird paradox is that the more you ask yourself that question \u2014 \u201CDeath is certain, its time is uncertain, what should I do?\u201D \u2014 this brings you back to a very vivid sense that you\u2019re alive. It intensifies the sense of aliveness, in terms of how you see the colors, the shapes, the leaves, the flowers, the \u2014 whatever impacts you visually, from the ears to the nose to the tongue to the body to the mind \u2014 it is a kind of intensifier of being alive. A kind of \u2014 almost a celebration of being here at all. And that is infused not only with a sense of wonder, but also with a sense of possibility, a sense of responsibility, that in what you say, think, do, this may be your final legacy on this earth. That, to me, is where this reflection leads me. And it\u2019s with me \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say every single minute of every single day. I also have moments in which I\u2019m not particularly\u2026 Right. \u2026proud of how I speak or act or think. But broadly speaking, I find myself constantly returning to what\u2019s implicit in that question. And that has made my life, I think, very full. I\u2019m deeply grateful for the practices that this tradition has brought me. And I very much hope that others, too, will find value in these ideas. And it will allow their lives, too, to flourish.
