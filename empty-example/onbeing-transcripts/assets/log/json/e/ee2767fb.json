  "fullText": "While I\u2019m on stage, you\u2019re all my guests, because that\u2019s sort of like the the unsaid agreement. So while you\u2019re my guest, if something bad happens on stage, I often think of Julia Child \u2014 \u201COh, the chicken\u2019s fallen on the floor! Yes. Oh, well pick it up and put it right back.\u201D And you know what? Everybody\u2019s with you. So whatever you practice for on the engineering side that fails is all right, because we have a greater purpose. The greater purpose is that we\u2019re communing together and we want this moment to be really special for all of us. Because otherwise, why bother to have come at all? It\u2019s not about proving anything. It\u2019s about sharing something. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma is one of the most famous musicians in the world. In this generous and intimate conversation, he shares his philosophy of curiosity about life, and of performance as hospitality. In his art, Yo-Yo Ma resists fixed boundaries. He\u2019d like to rename classical music just \u201Cmusic\u201D \u2014 born in improvisation, and traversing territory as vast and fluid as the world we inhabit. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. In addition to his numerous Grammys, Yo-Yo Ma has received the National Medal of Arts, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the 2014 Fred Rogers Legacy Award, of which he said, \u201CThis is perhaps the greatest honor I\u2019ve ever received.\u201D I spoke with him that year from Boston, where he lives. Let\u2019s dig in. I\u2019ve been steeping \u2014 I\u2019ve been listening to your music forever. And then, getting ready for this, I\u2019ve been reading a lot of other interviews you\u2019ve given and things you\u2019ve written. Uh-oh. So, yeah, I\u2019m just going to jump in. So you\u2019ve prepared. I\u2019m prepared, yeah. Oh, no. So you were born to Chinese parents in Paris. And then you straddled another world when you moved to the U.S. as a child. You know what? I want to ask the question this way. Was there a religious or spiritual background to that childhood of yours? However you want to define that. Well, as you can tell from the brief bio, I grew up pretty confused because there would be all these languages floating around, different messages floating around. And in terms of a spiritual worldview, my mother was Protestant, my father was more or less Buddhist, and I grew up more or less Episcopalian. Confused. OK, got it. And so, I think I\u2019ve tried for all my life to make sense of things. I remember as a five-year-old \u2014 at the age when people say, \u201CWhen I grow up I want to do whatever\u201D \u2014 I thought that what I really wanted to do was to understand. That was a five-year-old\u2019s wish. But that gives you a little bit of an indication on where my mindset was. And I believe that was before we first came to the United States. So already I was kind of thinking, hmm. I wonder how things work in this world? Well, that\u2019s definitely \u2014 that question then echoes through the rest of your life. So we\u2019ll keep coming back to that. Now, you had already given up the violin by the age of four, when you took up the cello. And you have said that coming to the cello was \u201Ca compromise and an accident.\u201D Can you tell that story? OK, so, one day we \u2014 there\u2019s a very over-sized double bass that\u2019s maybe about eight feet, nine feet high, in the Paris Conservatory. We went by, saw it, and, of course, as a four-year-old, something huge, something big. Oh, I like it. I want to play that. So I was haranguing my parents, saying, \u201CGive me this instrument.\u201D And of course, it was not possible for a four-year-old. And then the compromise was the next largest instrument, which was the cello. And that gave us Yo-Yo Ma, the great cellist. Yes. I\u2019m a firm believer of accidental meetings between objects, people, circumstances, because so much of my life seems to have been orchestrated in that way. Right. There is this parallel \u2014 really not just parallel, but interconnected, interwoven fascination for you, or passion, alongside music, within music, with this whole adventure of what it means to be human. So I think it\u2019s interesting that, even though you were something of a prodigy, that you then \u2014 you didn\u2019t immediately pursue that. You went to Harvard and studied anthropology. Do you think, even at that point, did things take up comparable places in you? This fascination with humanity and culture, and your life with music? Well, I think you point to a very consistent, parallel development. Skill at an instrument versus just trying to figure things out, trying to decipher people. I think my life-long preoccupation in the human realm has always been \u201CWho did it and why?\u201D Say some more. You mean, just everything that comes along, those are the questions you want to ask? Absolutely. Imagine a seven-year-old\u2019s mind going from a Parisian landscape of not tall buildings, but very interesting rooftops \u2014 tiled rooftops, sometimes with chimneys and whatever \u2014 to the landscape of rectangular buildings with an odd, at that time, water tower \u2014 a wooden sort of barrel at the top of it. It made me think, gee, who would have built that? What happened here? Somebody did it, right? And this would go to practically every asset of life. Why do people have different habits? Why is the bread square, white, and sliced, versus a baguette with that wonderful scent of baked goods in the morning, when you go by a patisserie, and it\u2019s just like\u2026 You want to grab the closest loaf of bread or croissant in your hand. And then to, obviously, to language and to behavior, to all kinds of things that I was receiving unconsciously, but probably early on starting to at least pose the question, why? How come? So what you just described about experiencing this spectrum of how humanity expresses itself in different cultures with all these things \u2014 architecture, food, and where you are a master is this realm of music. And the way you just talked about that actually helps me think about my sense that you are steeped in music as an entry point to all that \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to use the word \u201Cdiversity,\u201D because it\u2019s almost \u2014 it\u2019s an overused word, and it\u2019s almost too cold for what we\u2019re talking about \u2014 all that richness, all that variety. Is that right? Absolutely. I think Pablo Casals used to talk about \u2014 the great cellist from Spain, from Catalan \u2014 talked about infinite variety. And I think that\u2019s what I seek in the mind\u2019s eye. If you look at the, to quote Carl Sagan, \u201Cthe billions and billions of stars out there,\u201D and what stirs the imagination of a young child \u2014 you look at the sky and you start wondering, where are we? How do we fit into this vast universe? And to Casals saying that within the notes that he plays, he\u2019s looking for infinite variety, to Isaac Stern saying the music happens between the notes. OK, well, what, then, do you mean when you say music happens between the notes? Well, how do you get from A to B? Is it a smooth transfer \u2014 it\u2019s automatic, it feels easy, you glide into the next note? Or do you have to reach to get to the \u2014 you have to physically or mentally or effortfully reach to go from one note to another? Could the next note be part of the first note? Or could the next note be a different universe? Have you just crossed into some amazing boundary, and suddenly the second note is a revelation? So it\u2019s about merging different aspects of one realm, which, in the realm of playing an instrument, is pure engineering. But the mental process, the emotional process, the psychic investment in trying to make something easy \u2014 infinitely hard. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the singular cellist and citizen artist, Yo-Yo Ma. Were there kinds of pieces of music or, experiences of working with other musicians, or particular concerts \u2014 have there been cathartic moments where you discovered this, or started to be able to articulate it \u2014 or even something going on now? I\u2019m just wondering if you can embed that in a piece of music or a story. Sure. Well, I\u2019ll give you two. So one of the composers that wrote for cello alone, Bach, wrote six of these wonderful suites. And they\u2019re different movements. I have a moment of going between the moment at the end of a movement to the beginning of the next movement \u2014 so, actually, not necessarily coded or written in by the composer, they\u2019re just separate movements \u2014 that I remember often playing, loving the connection between the end of the Sarabande of the first, the G Major Suite, going into the Minuet, the next movement. Because there was something \u2014 a Sarabande is like a slow dance, and it goes into a Minuet, which is a slightly more lively dance. And there is something about the incredible restfulness of the way the first movement ends\u2026 \u2026and suddenly, the sunlight comes in. There\u2019s a moment where you can go into nature \u2014 always, at any moment, and figure out some parallel to what is happening in a sound-centric world. And that moment was amazing for me. I wouldn\u2019t want to end the day playing just the end of one movement without also including the other. And so there was a connective thing. So that\u2019s an early-age memory. I think you like to say that sound can be visual. Well, it\u2019s telling stories, giving narrative, giving substance or meaning to something that\u2019s coded that I think gets us to want to be involved in a specific world that one is describing. So you play and celebrate and encourage many, many kinds and forms and genres of music. But this example is classical music. And I did want to speak to you about classical music in the modern world, in a modern sensibility. I wonder if you would say something about how classical music distinctively works for us and with us. It seems to me that you were just describing there is this fullness and drama and sweep that a classical piece is capable of, and that\u2019s quite unusual, even compared to other kinds of complex music. But I don\u2019t know if that generalization works. I don\u2019t know, either, because I both like to make sweeping generalizations, and I also don\u2019t like to make sweeping generalizations. Yeah. I know. Me, too. So I\u2019m always conflicted in that sense. I think I would, first of all, say that the idea of classical music is kind of \u2014 the definition of it bears reexamination. In some ways, it\u2019s a false category. It\u2019s certainly a commercial category, because you can then \u2014 with that category, you can go into a certain world and assume that there\u2019s a certain number of things that are going to be there. Some people would say, well, classical music is really \u2014 its roots are church music, court music, and popular music. So they\u2019re all mixed in. So the sacred and secular definitely are part of it. And the sacred, secular, and, certainly, the folk elements in Haydn and Mozart and Brahms, the Roma people. It\u2019s all over the place. Yeah, but you\u2019re right. That\u2019s not something, that\u2019s consciously pointed at very often or named. Exactly. And that\u2019s what I mean by large generalizations. There\u2019s that great famous New Yorker cartoon that says, for New York-centric people, it\u2019s Manhattan, there\u2019s the Hudson River, there\u2019s New Jersey, then there\u2019s the West Coast. And then there\u2019s Asia. So you get to a larger and larger way of collecting an immense amount of information into one word. And, obviously, we know it\u2019s not true, not quite true, but it serves a purpose. Even thinking about music as geographies rather than a timescape, right? Which, classical music is\u00A0\u2014 you\u2019re right, it sets it in time and makes it sound like something that once was. Right. It\u2019s \u2014 oh, yes, it\u2019s dead white European music. Well, what about the classical great composers that came to, not just North America, but to South America, that took in all of the influences of indigenous people \u2014 especially in places like Brazil, the African traditions \u2014 and then created a different sound, a different thing that we all treasure? And when something \u2026 So who would you think of in that category? Just give me an example that people might know. Well, OK. Let me use Argentina first. The music of Astor Piazzolla. Piazzolla, tango, nuevo tango. So here\u2019s a man who was born in Buenos Aires. His father was a barber. He came to New York for a better life when he was a teenager. And he heard \u2014 went, in those days, to jazz clubs in Harlem, loved the music. Then they had to move back because they couldn\u2019t make a go of it. Later on, he went to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, one of the greatest teachers of music ever, who influenced Stravinsky, Copland, and tons of musicians from everywhere. And she looked at his work and said, \u201COh, not bad. It\u2019s a good \u2014 you\u2019re trying to sound like Bartok and it looks pretty good. Let me see some other stuff that you\u2019ve written.\u201D And he shows her his tango-influenced music. And she said, \u201CWow. The other stuff is OK, but this stuff you should really continue, because that is just outrageously fantastic.\u201D So he went and continued to write in that style. So he now has jazz in his background. He\u2019s had the contemporary classical skill sets in his background. He has tango music in his background. Piazzolla, to this day, is claimed by everybody. He\u2019s claimed by world music, classical musicians, jazz musicians. He\u2019s one of us, because he\u2019s put in and people recognize, in his music, their own DNA in it. So if you could replace the words \u201Cclassical music\u201D with another phrase, or some other words, what would they be? I would say that, most people who\u2019ve tried, they just say \u201Cmusic.\u201D Music of our world. And, obviously, classical music, which had roots in improvisation \u2014 Bach, Mozart, Beethoven were some of the greatest improvisers of their time, and, in fact, were renowned for what they were able to do, but then also wrote things down. We know their work because there were no recordings at the time of the music that they wrote down. So I would have a template for good musicians that, as people who know something very, very \u2026 Good music. Yeah. Good music. Look, or any type of music can be part of good music in the sense that \u2014 but I\u2019m not even saying good music. I\u2019m saying good musicians would be able to compose, to improvise, to be virtuosic in what they do, and can easily absorb other influences and make it organically their own so that new influences are embedded. So there\u2019s the process of constant growth. And then, finally, the last quality would be the musician that actually is able to transfer, to inject, all of their knowledge and give it to somebody else so that they can actually look at the world and figure it out for themselves without the first musician being there. So it\u2019s a process of birth. It\u2019s a process of constant cultural rebirth. You can listen again and share this conversation with Yo-Yo Ma through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a spacious conversation with one of our greatest musicians, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. We\u2019re exploring his philosophy of life and of performance. He\u2019s described himself as a \u201Cforensic musicologist\u201D \u2014 dedicated to decoding the music of creators who are no longer with us. But Yo-Yo Ma also makes music with a vast range of living artists, from Bobby McFerrin to the Kalahari Bushmen. His \u201CSilk Road Project,\u201D named after the ancient trading route that joined the Mediterranean and the Pacific, knits far-flung contemporary worlds together by way of musical encounter and understanding. His Silk Road Ensemble involves musicians from this array of cultures. So it seems to me, also, that even as you described \u2014 you\u2019ve sometimes thought of a \u201Cforensic musicology,\u201D that you were asking, \u201Cwho did this and why?\u201D It seems to me you\u2019re also doing that all the time in your life of music with musical creators who are with us, playing music, making music with so many others. And when somebody \u2014 if somebody sees you on stage, and even if you\u2019re together with someone else, this other person is very skilled, and there\u2019s a feeling of mastery, perfection. But I think that the state you\u2019re in, and the experience you\u2019re having and that you\u2019re making, is much more vulnerable than an audience might realize. Yes. A lot of artists will say, \u201COh, I have to make myself so vulnerable.\u201D And that is absolutely true. If you\u2019re well defended \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m going to show you how strong I am\u201D \u2014 then that precludes the idea of saying, actually, \u201CI\u2019m very weak.\u201D Because weakness can be a strength as a form of expression. So if you only show strength, you\u2019re showing a one-dimensional aspect of something that you\u2019re trying to describe. If you only show weakness, obviously, one thing. But if you show both, and you show the variety in between, you\u2019re describing a multi-dimensional world. Which is what we are, I guess. So I think another state that I\u2019m fond of describing is \u2014 when I come to Minneapolis, I\u2019m a guest in your town. But when I\u2019m on stage, all of you that are in the hall are my guests. So I\u2019m the host of a wonderful party. You\u2019re all my guests, because I have the floor. While I\u2019m on stage, you\u2019re all my guests, because that\u2019s sort of like the unsaid agreement. So while you\u2019re my guest, if something bad happens on stage \u2014 I often think of Julia Child. \u201COh, the chicken\u2019s fallen on the floor! Yes. Oh, well pick it up and put it right back.\u201D And you know what? Everybody\u2019s with you. Because \u2014 and even if nobody\u2019s going to touch the chicken, they\u2019re not going to let that moment spoil their evening. They\u2019ll remember, \u201COh, yes, oh, remember when Julia dropped that?\u201D Oh, that\u2019s so great. That\u2019s such a great image for life. Yes, exactly. So, it\u2019s like, \u201COh, well, this happened. Boom!\u201D But, actually, that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here, to watch the bad things that happened. So whatever you practice for on the engineering side that fails is all right, because we have a greater purpose. The greater purpose is that we\u2019re communing together and we want this moment to be really special for all of us. Because otherwise, why bother to have come at all? So it\u2019s not about how many people are in the hall. It\u2019s not about proving anything. It\u2019s about sharing something. It\u2019s about being whole together, too, isn\u2019t it? Which includes\u2026 Yeah. There\u2019s something that\u2019s so \u2026 \u2026all these things that could go wrong. Absolutely. It\u2019s so \u2014 rewind to September 11. On the morning of September 11, I was in Denver. At nine o\u2019clock, my wife calls me and says, turn on the television. Something bad is happening. I turn on the television. I\u2019m supposed to go to Colorado Springs on the 11th, and to Denver to play another concert on the 12th, and the 13th in Phoenix, Arizona \u2014 three different orchestras. And so, in the wake of this horrific thing, every orchestra had to decide, do we cancel or do we play? And what every orchestra decided was, we\u2019re going to play. We may change the program a little. We\u2019re going to actually be together and have a moment, literally, of being together. And music will be the way that we will come together. Because we\u2019re asserting ourselves as a community, as a people, as a city, as whatever. And we need to be together. So, to this day \u2014 this is now, how many, 12 years later \u2014 when, if I go back to any of those places, not a single person does not remember vividly what that evening meant. I think that\u2019s a wonderful image for some language you use of being a citizen artist, and that this insistence that this must be at the table, arts, in music, as we define ourselves culturally and weight it as defining alongside politics and economics and the things we discuss in a more \u2014 that we sometimes seem to take more seriously. Well, I think it depends how much room we have for what. And the thing is, again, what is it and why? What are we doing here? What \u2014 who are we? And I often ask musicians, what do you think of yourselves? As the instrument that you play as your identity? Or do you think of yourself as a musician? Or do you think of yourself as a human being? And what is the ratio between the three? I think that the citizen part is somewhere towards the human part, because we\u2019re looking at how we fit in within society. And if we look at our Constitution, we have an ideal of what our nation could and should be like. So how do we participate? I know I, for one, often feel frustrated and say, there\u2019s so many things that are happening, and I have nothing to do with it. I\u2019m not connected to it. So, therefore, I can\u2019t care about it, because it\u2019s just a waste of time and energy, because it\u2019s all beyond me. Now, that\u2019s kind of like giving up. It may be true \u2026 And I think that\u2019s an experience so many people have. Yeah. So many people who do different things in different corners. But ultimately, if we are the democracy that we claim to be, it does require full participation. And that\u2019s the anomaly that I\u2019m sort of trying to wrestle with in myself, too. As a musician, I\u2019m thinking, OK, well what in the world can I do? Essentially, it\u2019s like what my wife always says to me \u2014 don\u2019t just make lists. Just ask, what can I do to help? And I think if we ask, if we even start to look, you will find lots and lots of needs. I love this language of Rilke about \u201Cliving the questions.\u201D And I think there is something powerful about posing the question. You can\u2019t live into it unless you ask it. Right. But once you ask it, you see, you already put yourself in a position of slight vulnerability because you don\u2019t know the answer. And I think that by doing that, you can actually begin to see where the solutions may lie. At least you start to open yourself to someone else who might propose a solution that starts to lead us in a certain position. And I think that\u2019s where the basis of a cultural citizen or citizen musician comes in, because I think that, as musicians, music actually very easily crosses spaces. You go from people\u2019s earbuds, into concert halls, into living rooms, into cars \u2014 so it can exist across a lot of different physical spaces and geographical spaces. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with cellist and citizen artist, Yo-Yo Ma. I\u2019m curious about your relationship with your cello or your cellos, probably. Do you have more than one? Or do you have one? Yeah, I play on a number of instruments. Two of them are old and several of them are new. I\u2019m wondering, is it like a part of your body? Is it like a friend? Is it like a family member? Can you talk about that? As usual, I feel two ways about it. See how conflicted I am? It\u2019s a wonder I can get up in the morning. Should I get up? Why should I get up? Who am I that thinks I should get up? It gets very confusing. I love the instruments I play. But I also like to be separate from them. So I think the image I have of the four strings of the instrument and the bow I use is that the bow, which draws out sound, are the lungs. And the strings that are on the instrument are the vocal cords. So I think of instruments as sort of the extension of the lungs and the vocal cords. And the instruments are great pieces of, in a way, sculptural architecture, designed to give life to sound and beauty and all of those aspects. And I can talk a lot about sort of the golden periods of certain instrument making and why it became that way, whatever. But for now, it\u2019s really \u2014 these are relationships with separate instruments, and each of them has a different quality. The Stradivarius I play on is more of a tenor instrument, meaning that the core sort of sound that the greatest string might be the top string. A Montagnana, the Venetian instrument I play on, may have, as its core, the lowest string. So it become more like a bass baritone. And so there are differences, the way there are differences in wines, in all kinds of \u2026 In voices, in human voices also. And in human voices, right. And then you try and balance out what needs to be in another space, which is \u2014 if it\u2019s a concert hall you\u2019re playing in, I think of each concert hall as a different instrument. Because each concert hall has separate qualities. So obviously, in a theater, it has a dry acoustic, because you really want to hear words. But in a place like Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, it is reverberant, because it wants to blend the sounds of various instruments. And so it has a longer reverb. Two seconds or something. And then there are multipurpose halls that are configured for whatever the needs may be. If it\u2019s a conference, obviously on the drier side, if it\u2019s \u2014 so I think knowing the space that you\u2019re in is really important. I\u2019m not saying that you match the instrument to each hall, but that you just want to know the characteristics so you can start to work in a way that works for the listener because \u2026 So you\u2019re never even just working with the instrument. You\u2019re working with the instrument and the environment. Absolutely. So it\u2019s the environment. And, as I love to say to people that want to listen to me, is that, if you\u2019re going to perform some place, please don\u2019t fall in love with what you\u2019ve constructed. It\u2019s like in the Marines \u2014 don\u2019t fall in love with your plan, because the plan\u2019s always going to change. And you need to make sure that the audience is the most important person in the room. Because if you want to make something that\u2019s memorable for somebody else, as well as for yourself \u2014 the purpose of playing, of doing live music, is that it\u2019s like a communal witnessing of something. Hmm. So, somebody said to me, who\u2019d seen you perform up really close \u2014 I think maybe when you \u2014 it\u2019s one of my producers \u2014 I think maybe it\u2019s when you did a performance at NPR. She said, in a way that she had never seen before or since, she said that you radiated joy. And I\u2019m curious about \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen that at more of a distance in your performances. And I wonder if \u2014 is that something you\u2019re conscious of? Is it something that developed over time \u2014 has developed over time? Well, I think it has some connection to the hosting and guest thing. Imagine being a host of a party and walking out and saying, \u201COh, so you\u2019re here.\u201D Right. But is this a presence that you grew into \u2014 that you settled into? Possibly. I mean, I don\u2019t have that good a memory for a state of mind of from 30 years ago, 40 years ago. So I think that it\u2019s part of that host thing. You can\u2019t be a pessimist on stage. Yes, but you can\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be joyful, right? And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something either that you can manufacture. You can find \u2026 You can be gracious without being joyful. True. There\u2019s some quality to your presence in \u2014 when you\u2019re playing your music. Maybe all the time. Well, maybe the joyfulness could be the hope of joy. Hmm. The intention. Yeah. I think \u2014 I often say optimism is a philosophy. Unless you\u2019re, obviously, 24/7 optimistic. Well, then, it could be a blessing and a curse. \u201CYour dog died? Oh, really? How wonderful.\u201D But I think I hear you saying you choose joy. I think so. Well, certainly, in performing, I think that is a choice. Because it really doesn\u2019t matter where I am in life, but I truly am happy and grateful that people have taken the time to show up. So if I\u2019m a host, I\u2019m entertaining guests. And I\u2019m not saying that that elevates or cheapens it, but in the tradition that we\u2019re talking about, and with the example of Nadia Boulanger saying that\u2026 About that musician \u2026 \u2026that you are a priest. You are entering into a priesthood. You serve that. You\u2019re looking for an elevated sense of being in existence\u00A0\u2014 at least, that the music should somehow make us better. Now, of course, we live in the 21st century, and I\u2019m not sure whether something like that works. I would like to think that that\u2019s certainly part of what we try to do. Well there\u2019s \u2014 I looked back, getting ready to interview you, at that appearance that you made on Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood. Oh. Back in the 20th century. I love Mr. Rogers. Yeah, I know you do. It was clear that you do. And I was so struck. Now, I think I was watching \u2014 I don\u2019t know where this came from, YouTube or something, but I didn\u2019t hear you answer this question. But to the point you just said about the great \u2014 potentially, the great responsibility of the priesthood of being a musician, he ended by saying, \u201CDo you know what a present that is, when you play something for somebody? It\u2019s just like giving them a present.\u201D That\u2019s so typical of Mr. Rogers, isn\u2019t it? Speaking of which, he \u2014 so we think of him as the children\u2019s program that he created for so many decades. And what\u2019s funny is, Mr. Rogers lives on. I mean, there\u2019s so many legions of people that grew up with him and they\u2019re still, in a way, growing up with him. And he, of course, was a minister. I forgot that. And the children were \u2026 I had forgotten that. Yeah. And he \u2014 the children of the show in the neighborhood are his ministry. And what a beautiful thing that is. So I, to this day, when someone says, \u201CWhat are you most proud of, to have accomplished?\u201D I am so proud to have been part of that. It\u2019s a wonderful image, also, of \u2014 as you say, he was also an entertainer, for tax purposes, probably. But entertainment is a kind of gift economy. A gift economy, I like that. Can I borrow that? Yes, you can absolutely borrow it. Relational, not transactional. Yes, Krista said. Yes, exactly. A gift economy. We just have a few minutes, but I think maybe where I\u2019ll end is \u2014 I\u2019m collecting definitions of beauty. I feel like beauty is \u2014 well, so I\u2019ll give you some that I love. In Islam, beauty is a core moral value. Scientists and mathematicians, and you\u2019ve named a few, talk about \u2014 if an equation is not elegant and beautiful, it\u2019s probably not true. There\u2019s this equation of beauty with truth. The philosopher and poet John O\u2019Donohue said, \u201CBeauty is that in the presence of which we feel more alive.\u201D I wonder \u2014 beauty is a word you\u2019ve used in this conversation. You use it a lot. Obviously it\u2019s just there in what you do, whether you\u2019re talking about it or not. I wonder if you\u2019d talk to me about the meaning of beauty for you, or the power of beauty in the world? Wow. What a simple question you\u2019ve posed. I know. I think I can\u2019t say the word \u201Cbeauty\u201D without also equating it with the word \u201Ctranscendence,\u201D because it seems like there\u2019s so many different things that are beautiful to so many different people. But I think beauty is often an encapsulation of a lot of different things in a certain moment \u2014 a frame, let\u2019s say. It could be music. It could be a poem. It could be an event. It could be in nature \u2014 and often, possibly most often, in nature. But when that encapsulated form is received, there\u2019s a moment of reception and cognition of the thing that is, in some ways, startling. And the moment you solve an equation. The moment that something is revealed, either in your own head or physically, materially revealed. When that moment happens, when, in the Sistine Chapel, when you see the finger \u2014 Adam just about to touch \u2014 there\u2019s that moment where something is being transferred. I think even when we observe nature \u2014 so if we are part of nature and we observe nature, but we\u2019re part of the human realm, and there\u2019s that moment which \u2014 essentially, there\u2019s a transfer of life. So even if you think nature is inanimate, and therefore\u00A0\u2014 but the beauty of nature, it\u2019s the human cognition of that vastness, the awe and the wonder, something that\u2019s, in a way, bigger than yourself. That phrase, \u201Cit\u2019s a transfer of life\u201D \u2014 I think, is also a wonderful way to talk about music, about what happens when you in the experience of music, of playing it, making it, or receiving it. Well, I think that\u2019s true. In the Silk Road Ensemble, I\u2019m fond of being able to quote a number of incidents where \u2014 Kojiro Umezaki, the shakuhachi player, which is a bamboo flute \u2014 when he plays a piece of music that was written after, let\u2019s say, I think the Tokyo fire of 1927, and he plays this sort of thing over and over again. And it\u2019s kind of \u2014 it\u2019s certainly deeply spiritual and mournful. I\u2019ve had more people come to me and say this is the most extraordinary thing I\u2019ve heard. Or if \u2014 Cristina Pato is the Galician bagpiper, plays the gaita \u2014 and she and Wu Tong come across the stage at one another\u00A0\u2014 or with Ko, so a bagpipe and a shakuhachi. And they walk across the stage and that, to me \u2014 I get the goosebumps of seeing this incredibly wonderful, but very powerful and penetrating instrument. I get a time-space-geography-crossing moment that cognitively makes me aware of the vastness of what, basically, humans all over the world have been trying to express for millennia. People have, for ages, been trying to code the awesomeness of the infinite variety of possibilities\u2026 There we are, back in infinite variety. \u2026of creation. With the Silk Ensemble, it\u2019s really that kind of thing, where we\u2019re trying to join people together in what might be an unusual way, but, in fact, has become more and more the usual, which elicits, sometimes, in people \u2014 you can turn fear into joy when you receive something that\u2019s living, that goes inside you. Because it becomes your own. Yo-Yo Ma\u2019s newest album is Songs from the Arc of Life with pianist Kathryn Stott, and his most recent release with the Silk Road Ensemble is A Playlist Without Borders. He\u2019s received over a dozen Grammy awards, as well as the National Medal of Arts, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the 2014 Fred Rogers Legacy Award.
