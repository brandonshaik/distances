  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder Bill Wilson once said that the program he helped create is \u201Cutter simplicity which encases a complete mystery.\u201D This hour, we\u2019ll explore the spiritual foundations of addiction and recovery. Kevin Griffin reflects on the consonance of Buddhist teachings and the Twelve Steps in his experience. Susan Cheever has written a biography of Bill Wilson, and she knows addiction and recovery in her own life and that of her father, the late fiction writer John Cheever. There\u2019s something mysterious at the heart of Alcoholics Anonymous, and whether you call it God or not, there\u2019s something mysterious there that makes people whole again. Addiction was just an extreme case of exactly what the Buddha was saying was the cause of all our problems. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Over 20 million Americans \u2014 nearly one in 10 over the age of 12 \u2014 suffer from alcohol or drug addiction. A comparable number battle other forms of addiction, sometimes simultaneously, including gambling, sex, and food. Until the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1930s, addiction was a nearly always fatal affliction, immune to the best methods of psychology or medicine. In seven decades since, the Twelve Step program of AA has saved or repaired the lives of millions across the world. And it has done so in part by analyzing addiction as a spiritual malady. The Twelve Steps\u2019 insights into the human condition and its disciplines for spiritual healing translate across the world\u2019s cultures and traditions. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Spirituality of Addiction and Recovery.\u201D Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder Bill Wilson once said that the program he help create is \u201Cutter simplicity, which incases a complete mystery.\u201D AA formed organically from the experiences of alcoholics themselves, forged in fellowship with each other, and condensed in 12 steps and 12 traditions. In 1939, the movement\u2019s first 100 or so members laid out what they had learned in a guiding text, The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Here\u2019s a recording of Bill Wilson, who died in 1971, reading from a chapter called \u201CHow It Works\u201D: (recording of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous) \u201CIf you have decided you want what we have, and are willing to go to any length to get it, then you are ready to take certain steps. At some of these we\u2019ve balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas, and the result was nil until we let go absolutely. Remember that we deal with alcohol \u00E2\u20AC\u201D cunning, baffling, powerful. Without help, it is too much for us. But there is one who has all power. That one is God.\u201D In such language, it\u2019s possible to imagine a quasi-religious movement. Later in this hour, I\u2019ll speak with Kevin Griffin, who\u2019s found life-giving resonance between the Twelve Steps and Buddhism My first guest, Susan Cheever, has written widely about her own experience with addiction and recovery, and that of her father, the late fiction writer John Cheever. She\u2019s also written a biography of Bill Wilson. I interviewed her shortly after the 2004 release of that book. Even as she describes the significant Christian influence in the formative years of AA, Susan Cheever also points out that Bill Wilson was never a conventionally religious person. He grew up in an age in which churches were a driving force in the temperance movement behind Prohibition, a legal ban on alcohol in the United States that lasted from 1920 to 1933. But in that same era, in the New England of Bill Wilson\u2019s childhood, the writings of American icons like Thoreau and Emerson were subtly affecting traditional ideas about God and faith. Susan Cheever suggests that these shifts in the American religious imagination made the accessible spirituality of AA possible. What was happening in the 1850s and \u201960s, before the Civil War in New England, contributed in a very direct way to what Bill breathed in and out with the Vermont air at the turn of the century. And I think the whole sort of overturning of the idea of God as an authoritarian male figure, that the divine could exist in the song of a wood thrush or the reflections in a pond, and that it could especially \u2014 this was especially Emerson\u2019s point \u2014 that it could exist in other human beings. And, of course, one of the things that Bill Wilson, in his genius when it comes to spirituality, understood was that it\u2019s a mistake to prescribe faith for another person, that you can say to another person, \u2018You must have some kind of faith,\u2019 as Alcoholics Anonymous sort of does, but you cannot say to another person, \u2018You must have faith in X.\u2019 It can reside wherever you say it resides as long as it\u2019s not you. What does that say about the spirituality of addiction itself? There\u2019s a wonderful letter. In 1961, Bill Wilson wrote a letter to Carl Jung, and Jung had treated a man who ended up being one of the original men in Alcoholics Anonymous. And this man, Roland, had often talked about Jung, and Jung writes back to Bill, and he says, \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 He says, \u2018I despaired of treating alcoholics, because I knew that they couldn\u2019t get better unless they had some kind of religious experience.\u2019 He called it religious. And then he came out with this wonderful phrase. He said, it has to be \u201Cspiritum contra spiritus.\u201D He draws that semantic kinship between spirits, as in alcohol, and the human spirit, but more than a semantic kinship. Exactly. You know, many, many people in Alcoholics Anonymous will say that alcoholism, that drinking is a low-level search for God. In other words, that the role of the spirit in the abuse of spirits is profound in its multiplicity. And I think, you know, Bill Wilson understood that very well. He was a man who had turned against religion, who had walked out of church, who did not want to be told what to do, who had walked out of church specifically because they asked him to take a temperance pledge. And he just thought it was a bunch of hooey. However, he was a man who was extremely open to ideas. So the identification of this as a spiritual malady was more important than prescribing a spiritual treatment? Exactly. I mean, he says somewhere in the writing that he\u2019s not going to give any alcoholic any rules, that everything he writes \u2014 I think it\u2019s in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, which he wrote, you know, later \u2014 is just suggestions. You know, he\u2019s just a profoundly tolerant human being. And, you know, you see it in his personal life in the way he dealt with his family, but you also see it \u2014 you know, the program of Alcoholics Anonymous is imbued with this tolerance. It reeks of it. The openness of it is so astonishing to me, and that\u2019s why, you know, I don\u2019t mean to be dancing around, but it\u2019s hard to pin down what faith is in terms of what Bill Wilson laid out as the program of Alcoholics Anonymous because he was so canny about not laying it down. I mean, he really wanted to make it a moving target. You mentioned this in passing that he did have this very dramatic experience of what I think he called God, of blazing light, right? Absolutely. And a mountaintop. And didn\u2019t he stop drinking on that day? Yes. There\u2019s no question that in his story, he was a man desperate to stay away from a drink. And over this period of about 10 or 15 years, he put together, one piece at a time, trial and error \u2014 mostly error \u2014 the things that helped him stay away from a drink. So he would get, for instance, that if he spoke to another alcoholic he had a better chance of not drinking. And then he would think, \u2018Oh, now I have it,\u2019 and then he\u2019d drink again, right? Or he would get, as he got from Dr. Duncan Silkworth, the idea that alcoholism was a disease, that it wasn\u2019t a willpower problem, that he was allergic to alcohol, and that was why he couldn\u2019t drink. And he\u2019d think, \u2018OK, now I\u2019ve got it,\u2019 you know? And then he\u2019d drink again. But slowly he was getting it. And the last piece, which he got during his fourth hospitalization at Towns Hospital on Central Park West, was a direct, extremely dramatic experience of God, where Bill Wilson, just feeling helpless and, you know, hopeless, fell to his knees and cried out, \u201CGod help me.\u201D And he had, you know, the room was suffused with light, a divine light. And he said, \u201CSo this is the God of the preachers.\u201D I mean, for him, there\u2019s no question that he had, like St. Paul on the road to Damascus, that he had a religious epiphany and that after that experience he never drank again. But, as I keep saying, and I hate to repeat myself, he understood that that wasn\u2019t going to happen to everybody. Yeah, and I will say I\u2019m a little bit surprised to \u2014 I\u2019ve been interviewing a few people for this trying to think about the spirituality of recovery. Mm-hmm. And I have actually heard two other stories that are very similar to that one. One of them was an Indian man, who \u2014 I mean who also \u2014 where the room opened up and it was not God it was his ancestors, but it was of a mystical experience that was very dramatic and a moment of healing in a way from which he never could turn back again. I mean, did you have a dramatic experience before you got into recovery, anything like that? I don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t, no, I mean I didn\u2019t have, I mean, I would certainly remember if I had that, that quality of experience. Yeah, yeah. But no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a direct experience of the divine. Indirect sure, but \u2014 I mean, I think of faith, for me at least, as not something I have. It\u2019s something I aim toward, I struggle towards. It\u2019s something I try to point myself toward, but it\u2019s not something I ever, ever have, you know, the way I have my keys in my pocket. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less real. Author Susan Cheever. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media.

Today, we are exploring spirituality, addiction, and recovery. Susan Cheever has struggled with addiction in her life, as did her father, the late fiction writer John Cheever. Her biography of AA co-founder Bill Wilson is called My Name is Bill. That title refers to the core principle of anonymity that guides Twelve Step philosophy. It begins at every local meeting, where people tell their stories and listen to others identifying by first name only. And such basic practices, as Susan Cheever tells it, have also changed her sense of the meaning of faith. You know, Alcoholics Anonymous is a very intimate way of living. And I think that for anybody who has faith, when they go into Alcoholics Anonymous that faith becomes much more intimate. In other words, it\u2019s one thing entirely to believe in a God who controls all, and it\u2019s another thing to believe in a God who really cares whether or not you drink that tequila shot. And it makes whatever your God is, whoever your God is, it makes it very, very personal and intimate. And I think that\u2019s, you know, one of the amazing things that Bill was able to do. He was able to take faith with a capital F, and God with a capital G, and bring it right into people\u2019s hearts and minds so that that faith becomes, you know, whether you\u2019re an alcoholic or you\u2019re addicted to food or you\u2019re addicted to heroin, God comes between your mouth and your hand. And that\u2019s just so amazing, because usually faith is something out there waiting for you, you know? Or, I mean, usually these things are thought of, or conventionally these things are thought of as very much outside the scope of what happens between your mouth and your hand. What is it about alcohol that can force people so close to this intimacy that you\u2019re describing? You know what? I think it\u2019s not just alcohol. I think it\u2019s all addiction. There is something about addiction, you know, just thinking about my own life, it comes from fear. This is just from me. You know, this is not from any other addict. But it\u2019s kind of fear-based. You know, there\u2019s kind of lack of trust. I mean, I certainly can talk about it right now in terms of food. I will say I\u2019m going to eat two soy cutlets for lunch and then around about 5:00, I think, \u2018Huh! There\u2019s never going to be any more food in my life. I\u2019m going to starve to death, and the cupboard\u2019s going to be bare, and there\u2019s going to be nothing in the fridge, and the markets are going to be shut.\u2019 And you see this fear, you know, when people hear there\u2019s a hurricane coming, they line up at the supermarket as if \u2014 you know, I think that fear is very much present in human life. But, so then, instead of waiting for dinner, I have to have whatever I have to. Do you see what I\u2019m saying? Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s a lack of trust. It\u2019s an inability to just think, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019 And, like, who was that, St. Julian? Julian of Norwich. Who said, \u201CAll will be well.\u201D Yes. \u201CAll things will be well.\u201D Yeah. It\u2019s the opposite of that. It\u2019s a kind of panic. It\u2019s, \u2018There\u2019s never going to be any more food.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s never going to be another drink.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s never going to be enough for me.\u2019 And in my experience, addiction comes out of that, that wanting, that hunger. And that\u2019s very intimate. In other words, you won\u2019t get a lot of people on the radio even copping to this stuff. And, you know, therefore, to put that into remission, or to calm it down, you have to have a faith or a system or whatever you\u2019re going to call it that\u2019s very intimate as well, because it\u2019s private, it\u2019s personal. And I think \u2014 you know, I often wonder why we live in a culture that is so blind to alcoholism and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons, it\u2019s so private, it\u2019s so personal what a person drinks or what they don\u2019t drink. And I think that\u2019s partly also the basis, you know, of Bill\u2019s understanding of the importance of anonymity is that anonymity sort of protects that incredibly intimate private nature of addiction and, you know, the treatment for addiction, of that change of heart. You know the human heart is such a, such a private and frightening place. But I also think that it \u2014 to me, one of the greatest \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the word is \u2014 one of the greatest foundations of spirituality is what Bill called anonymity and, you know, what Christ called humility. And I\u2019m sure that Buddha also had a name for it. I want to ask you about a couple of the other spiritual disciplines that are a part of AA, of the Twelve Steps. Mm-hmm. Storytelling, you know, why \u2014 why is that a spiritual discipline? And you are a storyteller, so I really want to hear your thoughts on it. I think storytelling is the whole game. You know, if I say to you, \u2018You\u2019re an alcoholic,\u2019 you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Goodbye.\u2019 If I say to you, you know, \u2018This happened to me, and this happened to me, and this happened to me, and this happened to me, and then this happened to me,\u2019 there might be something in that list of things that happened to me where you go, \u2018You know what? That happened to me, too.\u2019 And that\u2019s, you know, the best way of communication that we have. So what\u2019s spiritual in that? Well, to me, you know, the most spiritual thing anybody can do is connect with another human being. And that\u2019s how we connect: storytelling. Sometimes we\u2019re connecting with ourselves, but I think in Alcoholics Anonymous, the energy of this and the ability that we all have, the incredible eloquence that we all have about our own lives is harnessed in the service of connecting one alcoholic to another. And that gets at another discipline or aspect of Alcoholics Anonymous, a recovery that you can also find in all the religious traditions, just this value of community, of relationship, in AA. Well, I think what people get in AA is for an alcoholic who has not been able to stop drinking, to be able to stop drinking is one of the most miraculous things that anybody ever sees. And it isn\u2019t just miraculous for the alcoholic, it\u2019s miraculous for the alcoholic\u2019s family and everyone around them. I mean, people in Alcoholics Anonymous do have a change of heart. And it\u2019s ultimately mysterious. In other words, we can break it down and talk about storytelling, and this and that, but ultimately something happens to people who go to Alcoholics Anonymous with all its lack of rules and regulations that enables them to stop drinking a day at a time. And that really, I mean, this was my first exposure to Alcoholics Anonymous was when my father went. And he didn\u2019t want to go. He\u2019d been to meetings. He didn\u2019t like them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And finally he went to rehab, and he came out a different person. When he went into rehab, he was just this sour \u2014 he was ready to die. He just sat around criticizing all the time. You could just tell he was miserable. And so he made everybody else miserable. And he came out of rehab and started going to AA meetings, and he was a completely different person. He was totally engaged with the world. He suddenly wanted to learn how to work the dishwasher so that he could take care of himself. You know, he was funny, he was empathetic, he was concerned. You know, he was involved in other people\u2019s lives. I mean, he had a change of heart that blew us all away. And so, to my mind, you know, there\u2019s a countervailing force to addiction. And you see it at work in people who go into Alcoholics Anonymous and go into recovery. And, you know, maybe the brain chemistry changes. I\u2019m sure it does. And maybe it has something to do with the power of the group. I\u2019m sure it does. But there\u2019s something mysterious at the heart of Alcoholics Anonymous, and whether you call it God or not, there\u2019s something mysterious there that makes people whole again. And to my mind, that\u2019s a pretty good argument for faith.

Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, exploring the spirituality of addiction and recovery My next guest, Buddhist meditation teacher Kevin Griffin, has found Twelve Steps spirituality and Buddhist insights to echo and inform one another to profound effect. He\u2019s written, \u201CI need the wisdom of the Buddha to absorb the realities and mysteries of life; and I need the voices of a thousand alcoholics and addicts to keep me on track today.\u201D Like my first Susan Cheever, Kevin Griffin has chosen to break from the Twelve Step tradition of anonymity by writing and speaking publicly and in the media about his experience of recovery. He grew up in Northern California in the 1960s and \u201970s and became a musician at a young age, a story he tells in part in his book One Breathe at a Time: Buddhism and the Twelve Steps. Kevin Griffin struggled with addictions to alcohol, drugs, and sex until he was 35 years old. Even as, for some of those years he was a health-conscious vegetarian and a spiritually engaged person. In some ways my spiritual search was another search for a fix. Right. For another drug. And I\u2019ve seen people use it that way, not just me, you know, people who, you know, who don\u2019t relate as alcoholics or addicts, who get very caught up in having particular kinds of experiences. What I realized after I got sober was that I was overlooking the fundamental morality foundation of any kind of spiritual growth. And that came partly out of my own willful ignorance and partly because the way Buddhism was being presented in our culture in the \u201970s, was they were not emphasizing that aspect of it. Many of the people who got into Buddhism early on got there through LSD. Right, right. And, I mean, putting your story in the context of those times is \u2014 there\u2019s also this line that you talk about walking, even music like \u201CStrawberry Fields\u201D or Jimi Hendrix, those almost kinds of transcendent spiritual experiences that were connected with drugs and kind of exalted and very powerful, right? Well, yeah. I mean, \u201CStrawberry Fields nothing is real,\u201D I mean that\u2019s a very powerful, spiritual statement, and it\u2019s in the context of music that\u2019s kind of trying to induce that hallucinogenic state. Mm-hmm. So there was a lot of confusion about it. There still is. Yeah, and so talk to me about, tell me a little bit of the story about your turning point. I know that it\u2019s not one moment; it\u2019s a long passage of life. But what happened to start it to move you \u2014 what happened to really finally move you towards recovery, towards sobriety? Well, so I was trying to find my way out of suffering, basically. I identified that suffering mostly around depression, but it was certainly \u2014 really more complicated than that. Mm-hmm. And, yeah, basically I felt like I tried everything and nothing worked, you know, going so far as to go on a three-month silent retreat. If that doesn\u2019t fix you, what will, kind of. So that I then lost myself by turning myself over to this kind of homeless guru, and that\u2019s when I really kind of bottomed out, which was three years before I got sober. And I started to kind of rebuild my life, and it is mysterious in a way. I met somebody who was sober, a musician, and I was playing with him. And that gave me a vision of sobriety, where I thought, \u2018Oh, OK. He\u2019s kind of cool,\u2019 you know, \u2019cause you think that anybody who is into a 12-step program is just either a looser or, you know, some\u2026 That\u2019s what you thought, back then? Yeah, and \u2014 and the only person I\u2019d ever known who was sober was a friend of my parents, you know, so I didn\u2019t have any associations with my generation. Did you get into an AA, a 12-step group? Well, I don\u2019t really talk about that specifically what program I got into. I know that\u2019s kind of drawing a ridiculous line, but I acknowledge that I have broken my anonymity on a public level. Right. Right. And it just \u2014 I don\u2019t say the words, and it\u2019s almost like superstition. OK. All right. That\u2019s fine. Then I will honor that as kind of part of the mystery somehow. So you\u2019ve written an analysis of desire is at the root of the compatibility between Buddhism and the Twelve Steps, talk to me about that. Well, it comes down to the Second Noble Truth in Buddhism. So the First Noble Truth is the truth of suffering, the unsatisfactoriness of life. And then the Buddhist says the cause of that is our desire, or our clinging, our craving. So he\u2019s pointing at something that is exactly what addiction is about and it \u2014 the more I started to look at that the more I realized that really addiction wasn\u2019t something outside the of normal human behavior, it was just an extreme case of exactly what the Buddha was saying was the cause of all our problems. A magnification of that. Yeah, I mean, I talk about it as being a continuum of craving and attachment that in this sort of middle zone, we call it normal. And then when you get out to more the edges of that continuum, we call that addiction. But it\u2019s essentially the same thing. In a way, the spirituality of recovery is that we get to see that so clearly. Buddhist teacher and author Kevin Griffin. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Spirituality of Addiction and Recovery.\u201D In his book One Breath at a Time, Kevin Griffin describes the first three of the Twelve Steps as the surrender steps. Here again is the voice of Bill Wilson, recorded in 1963, summarizing these three steps that he helped lay out in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. (recording of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous) \u201COne, we admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable; two, came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity; three, made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.\u201D And what\u2019s really fascinating to me as I read your work is how you \u2014 you live with \u2014 if I can put it this way with these different sacred texts, which is the teachings of the Buddha and the Big Book. Mm-hmm. Something that I\u2019m quite aware of is how there are some real problems with the language of the Twelve Steps in a modern Western imagination, right? You noticed that. And well \u2014 and you know, and you talk about how Buddhist will sometime balk, but other people balk as well. Oh, yeah. You know, just the basic in Step One, we admitted we were powerless. Twenty-first-century Americans don\u2019t admit that they are powerless over anything. Yeah, yeah. And you write and I think this is really part of it that\u2019s for many of us now, I think powerlessness equals passivity or giving up, but that\u2019s now how you\u2019ve come to experience it. No, I think that anybody who sits down and closes their eyes and tries to follow their breath immediately sees that they are not in control of their mind and body. And if you want to call that powerless or just not in control, it doesn\u2019t really matter so much. And that is more palatable somehow: \u201Cnot in control.\u201D Yes, yeah it is, and I think that partly the language of the steps is meant to be dramatic\u2014 Mm-hmm. \u2014so they really get your attention, but I got to a point where I kind of just reflected on how what happened to me when alcohol got in my body. And what happened was that the craving overcame me. And sometime before it got in my body, the obsession overcame. And to say am I actually powerless, can I do nothing \u2014 no that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s just that the force of energy is so strong in that direction that it\u2019s unlikely that I will do anything. So it\u2019s a problematic word in certain ways. Now, there\u2019s the Buddhist teaching about sickness, old age, and death, something else that, you know, our\u2014 Americans don\u2019t \u2014 \u2014culture doesn\u2019t like to think about. Right. Don\u2019t really accept. Yeah. Yeah, or even just the basic principle that suffering is a central experience of life. That\u2019s not the way Americans describe life. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and suffering is the common translation of the word dukkha, which \u2014 as is true of many of the terms in Buddhism \u2014 our English translation doesn\u2019t quite grasp it, so we have to use a variety of words. So unsatisfactoriness is actually kind of more accurate in a lot of ways, in the sense that there\u2019s no moment at which you arrive at total satisfaction in your life. You have a moment of intense pleasure and then it\u2019s gone. It doesn\u2019t continue then, you know, it\u2019s, as I like to say, after sex a cigarette, you know. Right. I mean, you know, sex wasn\u2019t enough? I mean my goodness. You use also, this example of the tradition commercial at the end of the Super Bowl. Right. You\u2019ve won the MVP award for the Super Bowl, and now, \u201CI\u2019m going to Disneyland.\u201D Right. Like it wasn\u2019t enough to reach the pinnacle of your profession, but in fact the only place to go after that is the place where dreams are made, you know, because you\u2019ve already achieved everything in reality. Right. I mean, it\u2019s never enough. And that\u2019s the real powerlessness of life, I think, you know, that it\u2019s never enough. You never have what you want, and the fact is that that\u2019s because desire tells you that once you satisfy it, you\u2019ll be OK. And that\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s this lie that we keep believing. I mean, I also want to say, very quickly, that when we set up the idea that not having desires is the way to be happy, then we just create another goal and another way of beating ourselves up. \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve still got desire, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019 And, you know, desire is a natural human quality, you know, we wouldn\u2019t survive if we didn\u2019t have desire. So it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s great to me about spiritual teachings is that when you get down to it, there\u2019s always a paradox there. And it\u2019s never just this, OK just do this and then, and then everything is OK. And that\u2019s the argument that I have with fundamentalism, including fundamentalist Twelve Step. Right. Which there is plenty of, and fundamentalist Buddhist. You know, there isn\u2019t this one answer that satisfies us in every situation. That\u2019s why we have to be mindful. That\u2019s why we have to be awake. And then of course the other language that comes into steps two and three of the Twelve Steps is about the higher power: \u201CWe came to believe that power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.\u201D And Step Three: \u201CMade a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.\u201D I think the language of higher power is again, as you said, it\u2019s dramatic and it doesn\u2019t quite seem to fit a modern imagination. But I wonder if it was especially challenging for you as a Buddhist? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, for me it\u2019s about deepening and moving forward in my spiritual path, my spiritual growth. And so I think it\u2019s more than the words. I think the words are pointing to the problem, which is that people loose their way, their sense of connectedness of surrender, you know, of being \u2014 I guess having faith or being OK, um, and trusting in the process. And the higher power \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of ways we can talk about higher power, one of the main ways I talk about higher power is the law of cause and effect, also known as karma. So if you act in ways that are going to lead to more harmony and happiness in your life, you are going to have more of that. If you act in unskillful ways and immoral ways, you\u2019re going to get those results. And when you turn your will in your life over it means that instead of following your own reactive self-centered, selfish, greedy mind, you are saying there is a better way to live. So for me, it\u2019s not religious or even about God, although I do believe that what I call God includes karma and karma is a big part of what I call God. Author and Buddhist teacher Kevin Griffin. He describes the fourth through ninth of the 12 steps of recovery as a stage of \u201Cinvestigation and responsibility.\u201D This begins with Step Four, as the Big Book puts it, to make \u201Ca searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\u201D Kevin Griffin says that his own process of taking a moral inventory back through his life also became an exercise in better understanding some of the core spiritual teachings of Buddhism. You know, you talked about, when you were there going back through broken relationships and violence and recklessness and you wrote, \u201CEach of these memories was like a slap in the face, an awakening to another view of the world.\u201D And then you write, \u201CThis was slowly, painfully the beginning of compassion developing in me.\u201D Now, explain that. So when we can admit deeply to our own failings, then we can start to potentially accept the failings of others, and that\u2019s what I meant by that. That it\u2019s harder to judge others when you\u2019ve seen how your own weaknesses and the mistakes that you\u2019ve made and really been honest about them. Then you can see someone else \u2014 instead of saying, \u2018Oh, what an idiot,\u2019 or worse language, saying \u2018Oh, that\u2019s really sad that they are doing that to themselves and that they are doing that to the world or to me even.\u2019 Because they are creating this suffering for themselves and indeed they are expressing their own suffering. You know, I had a boss one time, who \u2014 I was driving magazine deliveries, and his bookkeeper was really an angry person and was really difficult to be around. And I remember saying to my boss one time, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s such a pain.\u2019 You know what he said, \u2018You know what I do, when I hear him talking like that, I think that\u2019s the way he talks to himself. He\u2019s walking around with that voice in his own head and then I feel compassion for him, rather than being angry with him.\u2019 I thought that was a very wise thing. That is very wise. It\u2019s hard to live that way though. Well, of course, I mean, that\u2019s why you have mindfulness to try to remind you the root of the word mindfulness \u2014 the word we translated mindfulness from: sati. The root of that word has to do with memory and, you know, I often say to people it\u2019s easy to be mindful in a moment if you just remember to do it. The hard part is to remember to be mindful. Concentration, that\u2019s difficult to sustain, mindfulness easy, you should know OK. To say, \u2018Oh, be mindful. OK, yeah. All right. Here I am sitting in the studio I see the microphone, you know, here I am, I feel that.\u2019 But how do I remember to do that all the time? That\u2019s the hard part. So that\u2019s why we practice, that\u2019s what practice is all about, right, is to embed that habitual tendency to remember. And this also does get at I think a hard question about \u2014 you talk about your experience and this is an experience many people have had of implementing this practice of seeing, seeing the destructive patterns of their own behavior and then in that act of seeing becoming aware, beginning to change, unraveling the habits. And yet we\u2019re learning more about biological roots of addiction, we know more about mental illness and even just the stubbornness of human behavior that may have to do with how our neurons fire. I just, I wonder do you, do you believe, do you feel that most of us or all of us in some part of ourselves are capable of this kind change, or how do you wrestle with that? Hmm. Well, one day at a time Hmmm. You know, and I\u2019ll say that there are some things and they talk about this, I think Bill Wilson talks about this in The Twelve \u2026 and Twelve \u2014 there are some things that we can really change. And like I don\u2019t have the obsession to drink any more or to take drugs. Occasionally, I might think it would be nice to have a cold beer, you know, but I don\u2019t have the obsession anymore. So that has really been uprooted, but there are other things, as you say, that are perhaps, yeah, somehow more hardwired into us. Certainly, I mean, I think sex addiction is really, I mean, what a challenge, you know, that\u2019s an energy that you have in you and you don\u2019t just turn that off, you don\u2019t just \u2014 I mean there\u2019s nothing to put down. You know, you can\u2019t just stop going to the liquor store. Right. You know, it\u2019s with in you, and the same with food addiction. I mean, people, who have food addiction, have to eat their drug of choice three times a day. Right. You know, I mean what a challenge. So there\u2019s two different ways we can look at this. There are things that change, that really do get uprooted, and then there\u2019s things that we learn to live with. And living with, I mean, that\u2019s the First Noble Truth, you know, that there\u2019s suffering and that you don\u2019t get to turn it off. And so it\u2019s how we hold the experience, it\u2019s how we live with it. I mean, that\u2019s the grace of spiritual life, is how we live with our struggles, with our suffering. I mean, that\u2019s why happiness is not about pleasure. Kevin Griffin. Here again is the voice of AA co-founder Bill Wilson reading the final three of the Twelve Steps. (recording of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous) \u201CTen, continue to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong promptly admitted it; eleven, sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for the knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out; twelve, having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.\u201D For you, as a Buddhist in recovery, there is this very intriguing echo between the real meaning of the name Buddha, which is to be awake, and then Bill Wilson several thousand years later is talking about spiritual awakening. It is very interesting to see you make that connection. Yeah, mean it\u2019s one of the easy ones to make. It\u2019s very clear isn\u2019t it, um, and you know awake is a metaphor. So part of our work is to figure out what awake is and how I bring that about. And the awakening, it comes at the end rather than at the beginning. I think in our culture we think you have this breakthrough and then everything flows from there. But this is, this is an awakening at the end of an incredible amount of hard work and really not at the end, because then the cycle starts all over again. Yeah, you know, there are different models about awakening and, you know, Jack Kornfield has that book After the Ecstasy, the Laundry, which is sort of the model you are talking about, you know, where you have this kind of breakthrough experience and then you kind of try to integrate that into your regular life. And the people have that. I haven\u2019t, unfortunately. You don\u2019t do the laundry yet? No, I \u2014 yeah, I do the laundry, I don\u2019t know about the ecstasy part OK. I>mean, I didn\u2019t\u2019 \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a breakthrough experience is what I\u2019m saying, and I have known people who\u2019ve had these moments before they even started spiritual practice, where they had some kind of enlightenment experience or satori or whatever you call it. And ultimately the problem with having the big breakthrough moment is that it actually doesn\u2019t solve anything. I was teaching this weekend and saying that, you know, right now as I\u2019m teaching, I\u2019m teaching you about things that I\u2019m not experiencing right now. I\u2019ve had the experience of them, you know, I\u2019ve had these experiences of deep emptiness or stillness or tremendous sense of connectedness or ecstasy, but right now I\u2019m just sharing about them and having had that experience I can refer back to it. And that\u2019s the value of it actually that, you know, what I thought when I got involved with spiritual practice was I\u2019m going to have this enlightenment experience and that\u2019s just going to carry me. I\u2019m going to float on that for the rest of my life, everything is going to be solved for me. Right. But it really \u2014 it\u2019s just a reference point. And if you forget that reference point, then you can just fall back into the same habits just as easily. Let me just ask this I think by way of ending. What do you understand about Buddhism that you might not have understood or at least so deeply or richly without the Twelve Steps, and what do you understand about the Twelve Steps that you think you see more clearly because of your Buddhist practice? What I saw through my Twelve Step work was that isolated intensive meditation practice was not going to fix my life. The Twelve Step program has helped me to get my feet on the ground and see that what they call in Buddhism sila, the ethics, is the foundation the moral \u2014 the morality is the foundation of spiritual growth. I did not see that when I met Buddhism. For the Twelve Steps, what I see is that Buddhist practices, especially, give me access to the spiritual experience the direct conscious contact that we\u2019ve talk about. It\u2019s not theoretical anymore. It\u2019s not just saying a prayer or going to a meeting. It\u2019s really having that authentic sense of touching something beyond yourself, something, you know, powerful and meaningful. Kevin Griffin is a writer and meditation teacher. His book is One Breath at a Time: Buddhism and the Twelve Steps. Earlier in this hour, you heard author Susan Cheever. In closing, final words of Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder Bill Wilson reading from the chapter called \u201CHow It Works,\u201D in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. This was recorded for AA World Services in 1963. (recording of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous) \u201CMany of us exclaimed, \u2018What an order. I can\u2019t go through with it.\u2019 Do not be discouraged no one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.\u201D In my unedited interview with Kevin Griffin, he delves in greater detail into Buddhist philosophy and the Twelve Steps.
