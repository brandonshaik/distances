  "fullText": "In 1995, a young environmental scientist, Craig Minowa, started the band Cloud Cult. Musically, lyrically, it\u2019s hard to categorize, and is sometimes called an \u201Corchestral indie rock collective.\u201D Less in question is the profound and life-giving force of Cloud Cult\u2019s music. The young band\u2019s trajectory was cathartically altered the day Craig Minowa and his wife Connie woke up to find that their two-year-old son Kaidin had mysteriously died in his sleep. The music that has emerged ever since has spanned the human experience from the rawest grief to the fiercest hope. We are really blessed as a band because our supporters are seekers. They come to shows with the masks down, and with their hearts on the outside. And since they\u2019ve gotten close to the albums, they feel comfortable with us. So they come and they share their stories and you find out how gorgeous people are, and we just have to keep working to peel those layers of skin off so that everybody can walk around in their gorgeousness. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I welcomed Craig Minowa and Cloud Cult to the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. Their base is the organic Wisconsin homestead where Craig and Connie Minowa live with their two children. So you\u2019ve been the soundtrack for my life for weeks now. Aww. Yeah. I\u2019m taking you to the gym. You\u2019ve been in the car with me. You\u2019ve been here at work. And now here you are in my space, and it\u2019s just so beautiful. Aww, thanks, Krista. Yeah. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s an honor to be here. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t wear shoes. I was going to say I read in my preparation that you like to play without shoes. Mm-hmm. And I wanted you to know this is a shoe-optional workplace. I appreciate that. And so you fit right in. Anyone else can take off their shoes, as well. I\u2019m wearing shoes tonight because we have company. But you can\u2019t imagine \u2014 we actually work here by day, and we moved all the desks out. They\u2019re downstairs. But we do have the sofas out. [laughter] Oh, fantastic! So you grew up in Owatonna. Mm-hmm. And was there \u2014 how would you talk about the religious or spiritual background of your childhood? I was raised in a very devoutly practicing Lutheran family. It was the kind of practicing that was every service and Vacation Bible School and volunteering for the church. And it was our community. Those were our closest friends growing up. And that practice was ingrained in me very deeply and beautifully, and in different ways. With my dad, it was that this is what we do, this is what we\u2019re supposed to do. And with my mom, it felt like she was passionately in love with her belief system and \u2014 the kind of thing where it\u2019s Easter morning, for whatever reason, daylight saving time is happening at the time, so you\u2019ve got to wake up really, really early. And as kids, we kind of realized, OK, we\u2019re going to have to go to the early service at six, and then volunteer to work at the breakfast, and then do the Sunday school, and then the late service, and get up an hour early to do that. But my mom was the real deal. She would wake up, it\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning, and we would hear, \u201CWake up, kids! Today is the day the Lord is risen!\u201D And she is so joyful about it. It was beautiful. And the same kind of thing, on Good Friday, she wept openly in church. Really? Mm-hmm. Wow. I also read somewhere that your mother said of you, \u201CCraig was early on interested in the stars.\u201D And I think that there\u2019s some star imagery in, I would say, your adult spirituality that\u2019s evolved. Yeah. When I was really young I was kind of an astronomy geek. All my friends were into football and trading football cards, and I was into memorizing the diameter of the planets and doing extra credit reports. And I used to sign my name \u201CCraig, Future Astronomer.\u201D Did you really? In some ways, yeah, it stuck around through the music. I think people have trouble classifying Cloud Cult. Both the group and the music. And I thought this phrase got maybe as close as I would get to saying \u2014 \u201Corchestral rock collective.\u201D And you\u2019re so beloved by your fans, and celebrated at this point. But like every overnight sensation, you had a decade or two in the shadows, right? It\u2019s interesting how we tell the story of the great success. Yeah. It\u2019s been a very long road. I feel like it\u2019s such a competitive field that you have to inherently just love it in order to survive. And I really like to compose and write and be in that sacred space. But I\u2019m not a limelight lover. But it comes with the territory, so I\u2019m thankful for the ritual of performance, and the ceremony that we can do when that is happening. So, in 2002, in February, your son Kaidin didn\u2019t wake up one morning. And it seems like you poured your grief into music. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how you would say it. How would you start to talk about that connection? Yeah. I really just didn\u2019t want to go out into the world at all. We had a little farm out in Hinckley. And all I wanted to do was go down to the basement and play recordings of him, and play music at the same time. And if I did that long enough, I would feel like I was with him again. And that was the only way that I could feel like I was with him again. And so, I did that pretty obsessively for a very long time. And it was \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any intention of creating a project out of it, it was just personal medicine. You use that phrase, \u201Cmusic as medicine.\u201D Had you thought of music as medicine before that? Oh, for sure. Yeah. It\u2019s always \u2014 it\u2019s saved me so many times. And I think it\u2019s such an important thing to push to our youth who have hormones flying through them. And they need things like that. But it\u2019s always felt like that. Something very, very spiritual and sacred. If you look at the history of music, for the vast majority of time, people have used music as medicine, or as a connection to the divine, and as a very, very sacred tool. And I think sometimes I talk about pop music, and I can come across as sounding like a scrooge or something. \u201CYou just \u2014 you have to do it sacred, otherwise it\u2019s \u2026\u201D But I think there\u2019s a place for the really light stuff, and there\u2019s a place for the highly intentioned stuff. And I\u2019ve been always very attracted to the highly intentioned. And so at that time, I needed that highly intentioned connection to the divine and personal medicine aspect of music more than anything. So it was very obsessive. There\u2019d be weeks that I wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house. I was fortunate to have a day job at the time that I worked remotely as an environmental scientist for the Organic Consumers Association. And so I wouldn\u2019t have to go anywhere at all. Well, you recorded over 100 songs, right? During that time? Over the course of a year, yeah. Do you listen to those songs now? Very, very rarely. I think it would be hard for any of us to have that kind of record. I don\u2019t know what an equivalent would be, in music or some equivalent, of that kind of dark place. Yeah. I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time I listened to it. And for the most part, the songs from those earlier albums are not an option for set lists now. We did them during sets for years, and they were a way on stage to connect with Kaidin, too, that I felt like as soon as we were up there, and you were playing, and you could get into that spot through the music, that I could feel his soul join me on stage by the end of the set. And I felt for years that if I left the stage and I hadn\u2019t gotten that deep, enough to feel his presence by the end of the set, that I didn\u2019t do my job that night. And I still feel that, but in ways where it\u2019s more \u2014 not exclusive. Like Cedar Falls last week, I felt my grandma up there with me. And then we had a story shared from fans and supporters of people that they\u2019ve lost, and I feel like the whole ceremony is an opportunity to raise the ghosts and mix them around in a celebration. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with singer-songwriter Craig Minowa of Cloud Cult at the On Being studios on Loring Park. It\u2019s pretty astonishing to read what people write from hearing the songs, that people respond \u2014 completely, directly, and intimately to your loss, because it turns out that everybody has lost. They\u2019ve lost in all kinds of ways, all kinds of people, relationships. This is one I wrote down. Somebody who wrote, \u201CI came across this band shortly after I tried to kill myself. And the song \u2018Thank You\u2019 reached into my soul and planted a seed of hope. A hope that life could be beautiful. That song was the first turning point of healing for me. And since then, Cloud Cult\u2019s music has continued to change and heal me.\u201D And there are thousands of variations on that theme. I wonder, was that a discovery for you, too? To look up and see that everywhere in the world? Yeah. Like I said, early on, it was a personal medicine, but then people started coming to shows that had similar loss. Initially, it was people that had lost children as well. They found comfort in that music. And as time went on, then there\u2019s more people that were coming with different \u2014 for different reasons. Struggling with addiction, or depression, things like that. And that\u2019s where I realized that, flash back to when I was in college and trying to decide what I was going to do for a major, and I remembered being in the woods and feeling like I need to decide between music composition and environmental science. And sitting out there meditating, waiting, and ultimately feeling I want to leave this place better. Music feels kind of too self-y, and I could do good with the environmental science. So at this point, now flashing ahead, where people are finding something good in it, and I feel like I could do good with this. I could continue to do this. And that\u2019s where things started to shift. But it was also very important at that time to realize that I needed to continue the humility and understand that when people are coming with those stories of struggles that they\u2019ve overcome, and sharing it in a way where they are honoring the band and the music, I recognize wholeheartedly that has very little to do with us, and that we\u2019re a reflection. There\u2019s something in this that they\u2019re able to see deeper parts of themselves. And all of that energy and power of healing and overcoming and hope is coming out of them. Yeah. You get to let it in, right? But you get to let it go through you, as well. Right. Exactly. I was thinking \u2014 and you have two other children now right? Mm-hmm. I was surprised when I was reading your story, and listening to the music, and you have \u2014 again, you heard Kaidin\u2019s voice, and I\u2019ve seen pictures of him. You have films of him that come out in films about the band. And two years old, right? A two-year-old. That\u2019s such an amazing \u2014 still so tiny, but so incredible. And I was thinking about before \u2014 it was way before On Being. It was when I was doing pilots. It was called \u201CChildren and God.\u201D Mm. But I heard in that time \u2014 and also I had young children at that time \u2014 there\u2019s this old \u2014 there\u2019s this Hebrew proverb, and I think there\u2019s actually an Islamic version of this, too \u2014 that before a child is born, the angel Gabriel tells them everything, all the secrets of the universe. And then kisses them on the forehead, and they are born, and they begin to forget. Mm. I think I had this feeling \u2014 and I saw it in these pictures of Kaidin \u2014 you have this feeling with children like they do know things. Like then they\u2019re closer to God, or whatever God is\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026and they just kind of embody that mystery. And you just wish they had the words to tell you\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026the secrets they know. And you also see them growing and becoming more like us. And but then also the fact that that\u2019s all of us, right? The child in each of us. So that\u2019s all part of our story. And you talk a lot about moving through that loss and through that grief as kind of a rebirth. This doesn\u2019t really sound like a question. I just wanted to tell you all I\u2019ve \u2026 I think it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019m just engaged. Does that make sense to you? It makes beautiful sense. I totally agree. And with Kaidin and with our kids now, we\u2019re asking what they\u2019re dreaming. You just know that they\u2019re connecting in a way that censorship hasn\u2019t stepped in yet, and that all that modeling hasn\u2019t stepped in yet. And, actually, the new album that we\u2019re just releasing is really about that adult reclaiming that child inside that can believe in magic, and connect to things in a way that doesn\u2019t have all the cynicism that we all end up \u2026 And knows things, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Kaidin had a look in his eyes that he knew. Every parent knows, they look at their one-year-old, two-year-old, three\u2014, six-year-old, whatever, and know that, whoa. You know way more than I understand you know. [laughs] And that is a beautiful thing. Mm-hmm. I was so happy you started with the song \u201CYou Were Born\u201D tonight. I love that so much. When did you write that? That was for Nova. After Kaidin had passed, Connie and I went through grieving for a few years, and then spent time rebuilding our relationship. And trying to get to a point that we felt like we could have the strength to have a child again. And we were lucky to be able to do that. And before Nova was born, we finished the Light Chasers album, and that was a song written specifically for him. I like that. That\u2019s that Einsteinian view of time looping around and \u2026 Yeah, that looping of time or lack of time is all over the place in there. And, in fact, there\u2019s a whole lot of intention in not getting too caught into the illusion of time. And I think the presence of Kaidin is only possible with that recognition that time doesn\u2019t actually exist on a level of quantum mechanics. Hence, when this illusion of the physical universe dissipates, or we fold back into dark energy or whatever the case is, I know that all those moments that we had with him, they are forever. And this moment with you right now is forever. Every moment is forever. And that intention on timelessness at this point in time is huge in our lives. Einstein said that our perception of time as an arrow moving forward, past, present, future, is \u201Ca stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201D Maybe you were referring to that quote. Exactly. We blend a lot of quantum physics into our philosophies and in our music, and I am an absolute lover of the fact of \u2014 or the idea of timelessness, and formlessness. Mm-hmm. I think somewhere you said that in that depth of grief, you \u2014 what did you say? You lost \u2014 after Kaidin died, you \u201Cgave up on God, and turned to science, and discovered magic.\u201D Yeah. There\u2019s so much to be said about a belief system and what kind of reality that sculpts for a person. Like I said earlier, I was raised in that Lutheran church, but when I was 16 and I bought my first car, it was Easter Sunday, and I had worked the night before until close. And it would be absolutely out of order in my family to not go to church on Easter Sunday. And but I had been up late working the night before. I was supposed to meet my family there. And I drove the car. And instead of turning to go to church, I turned and went to the woods. It\u2019s a big public woods that was there in Owatonna. And I sat out there, beautiful spring morning, everything coming to life, and had a religious experience that I hadn\u2019t ever felt within those four walls of the church. And magic was reborn in me. And it wasn\u2019t shutting any doors, or setting anything apart. Jesus spent his time praying in the garden of Gethsemane, and there\u2019s just \u2014 there\u2019s something to be said about stepping out into the wilderness and just letting those constructs of the mind disappear, and reawakening to the fact that it is an incredibly complicated, mysterious, and beautiful universe. And I can\u2019t put my finger on it, I can\u2019t name it, can\u2019t classify it, I can\u2019t put it in a box, so right now I\u2019m just going to lay back and be in awe. And maybe that\u2019s something that we all need to practice a lot more, which is the child in us. You can listen again and share this conversation with Craig Minowa through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the singer-songwriter Craig Minowa of the band Cloud Cult. I welcomed them to the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis before a live audience. So let\u2019s talk about some of your lyrics, which are so beautiful. Thank you. You\u2019re a poet. Actually this follows on what you were just saying. So in \u201CBreakfast With My Shadow,\u201D which is another \u2014 well, there\u2019s really so many wonderful songs, so many wonderful songs in your repertoire. Thank you. So, here are two questions. \u201CCan you fall in love with the things you only know, the things you may never touch?\u201D Another question, \u201CIf I truly believe that things can change, will I wake up to something different?\u201D I just want to know where you came out on those questions. Thanks. But also would you explain \u2014 I think I get this, but I\u2019d like to know how you explain, \u201CCan you fall in love with the things you only know, the things you may never touch?\u201D What\u2019s that about? I think that that is so much about so much of our reality. If we\u2019re \u2014 as a band, one of our recurring themes is that philosophical search for the divine, and the connection to God, however you want to define that, and that true source out there. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re never going to be able to wrap our heads around. And we\u2019ll keep trying to get as close to that as possible. And it\u2019s something that you really never do truly touch. And get down to the physics on that of where there actually really never is the actual touch. And so the whole thing is an abstract, but I\u2019m madly in love with it. And I want to live my life that way. Yeah. And what about, \u201CIf I truly believe that things can change, will I wake up to something different?\u201D I think that would go back to that same thing of manifesting the dream, create-your-own-reality kind of situation. There\u2019s so much to be said about the mantra and intention and practicing things over and over in your head, as far as how you want your reality to be sculpted. And it takes a lot of practice to do all of that. Presence, presence, presence. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. Or are you always thinking about the past? No, I\u2019m here. No, I\u2019m worried about the future. No, I\u2019m here. You have to keep on doing it. And you have to keep on believing in the bigger things, too. I mean, we\u2019re all told through the media to have this cynicism or to think that we understand the universe more than we do. And it takes a lot of strength to step out of that and say, I want to believe in something bigger, and I want to have guts to have faith in that without having to argue with anybody about what that is. I feel like hope is \u2014 and a rejection of cynicism is a huge theme that runs through your music, through Cloud Cult. And it\u2019s not just in the lyrics. I think it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a presence, and it\u2019s a spirit that \u2014 and the feeling, the joy, it\u2019s a hopefulness that kind of comes through the music, that transmits through the music. It occurred to me that \u201Clight chasing\u201D for you is a synonym for hope. That\u2019s true. Yeah, the Light Chasers album was a figurative and literal journey. The whole story was about a crew that decides to take off and \u2014 out into space and look for God, look for the light at the end of the tunnel. Like, physically go after it, and look until they find it. And in the end, all hope is gone, the fuel is gone, everything is spent, and there\u2019s nothing there. And it\u2019s not until that moment of surrender and apology, laying down all the layers of the \u2014 protective layers of the self, this ultimate moment of fragility where love is able to come outside of the skin, and then for that moment, there\u2019s that connection, and they see the light, and they recognize that was always there. And that we have to travel through the universe to do it. And, so there is that hope of that \u2014 those brief moments that we get to be in touch with that sort of power. It\u2019s brief, but how can we practice to make that more prominent in our lives? How can we practice to make that more prominent as a culture and as a global family? And one of the interesting things about that whole journey out into space to find that light is that space is curved. So the universe, instead of being a plane, can blow up like a balloon. And since there is no time on the energy level, you remove the facet of time. And if you remove time, and you could see far enough, the farthest that you could possibly see would be the back of your head. So, you can search as far as you want to search, and you can journey as far as you want to journey, and you\u2019ll ultimately end up right here, right now. And that gives me hope. I also think we live in this bizarre moment where we\u2019re inundated with the opposite of hope. Mm-hmm. The terrible things happening in the world, the presidential election, the way that \u2014 that won\u2019t make it into the show, but \u2014 [laughter] the way news is defined\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026and brought to us. But I feel like hope is making a comeback. Mm. I feel like what you\u2019re talking about, the way you\u2019re talking about \u2014 a lot of us are \u2014 we\u2019re just waking up to that. Mm-hmm. And it\u2019s kind of that thing that you said, we get to know it. Mm-hmm. We get to know it. All evidence to the contrary, notwithstanding. Mm-hmm. And also to say that\u2019s not the only evidence that\u2019s out there. Mm-hmm. But it\u2019s kind of countercultural. It\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I would totally agree. I think it\u2019s really difficult given the structure of the media, and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026you\u2019re going to get big kudos here, but what you do with this program is huge. It\u2019s not something \u2014 if there were more programs like this, then I think people would feel differently about humanity and the direction that things are going. But there\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s probably a genetic thing that we\u2019re attracted to the negativity because back when we were\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026hunters and gatherers, you had to be super \u2014 have our ear on the\u2026 Yeah. \u2026worst possible thing that could happen so you could protect yourself. But now people are attracted to that, and so the media provides it. And, I agree. It seems like a \u2014 we are really blessed as a band because our supporters are seekers. Yeah. And they come to shows with the masks down, and with their hearts on the outside. And since they\u2019ve gotten close to the albums, they feel comfortable with us as the band members. And so they come and they share their stories openly and quickly. You don\u2019t have to have icebreakers and the blessing that you probably see, too, is that you find out how gorgeous people are. That they \u2014 if they can talk about it openly and without protection, that just about anybody you can pick out on the street has gorgeous interior. And we just have to keep working to peel those layers of skin off so that everybody can walk around in their gorgeousness. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with singer-songwriter Craig Minowa and his band Cloud Cult at the On Being studios on Loring Park. So your new album is called The Seeker, right? Mm-hmm. You are, you\u2019re becoming more and more a theologian. I don\u2019t know if that, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m telling you. Oh. Uh oh. I mean, what\u2019s this song, \u201CThe Great Unknown,\u201D on this album. I have so many \u2014 just \u2014 I have favorite lines in this one. Correct me if I don\u2019t have a line right: \u201CWe were made to walk through fire in our dance shoes. God gave us words, they were I love you, please, and thank you. God gave us thirst, and it\u2019s a hunger for the universe. God gave you feet so you could find your own way home.\u201D That\u2019s beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, I \u2014 it\u2019s called The Seeker, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find. But, it\u2019s really not about an individual, it\u2019s sort of a story for humanity as a whole. And I feel like \u2014 that we\u2019re on that crust, that era, as a people, that we have the potential to wake up to a new age. We have the responsibility to wake up to a new age. There isn\u2019t any room for pessimism anymore. Mm. Time is limited and so, yeah, it\u2019s all on the table with this one, as far as lyrics go, of trying to wake myself and every \u2014 anybody around me up to the fact of, \u201Chey, let\u2019s go be good people and do a good job.\u201D You \u2014 that thing you said a minute ago as \u2014 it\u2019s a really perceptive way to talk about \u2014 we are riveted by the scary news. And we\u2019re hard-wired to be riveted by the scary news. Mm. To be a seeker, you \u2014 I think that there\u2019s a \u2014 you have to be choosing to be open to something scary that you don\u2019t know. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s an evolution. Mm-hmm. But it just occurs to me that The Seeker is actually \u2014 like that word holds \u2014 it\u2019s so gentle in a way. It\u2019s so open. But it\u2019s a departure\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026that\u2019s very courageous. Yeah. I think it doesn\u2019t classify either. I think you can be a part of any religion, or a part of any spiritual pursuit, and be a seeker. And it\u2019s kind of a scale. There are those that search a little \u2014 or are just hungrier for it. But I see the evolutionary aspect as well. There\u2019s the Carl Sagan book where he talks about how if you walked into a room and then your father walked into the room right behind you, and then your grandfather walked into the room right behind you, how long it would take before you hit an ancestor who was down on all fours. And he was discussing it on the level of just evolution in general, but I was thinking about it in the context of, OK what if that did happen? And ultimately what you end up with is about 250,000 people.\u201D Your dad, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, all of them in there, 250 \u2014 quarter of a million people. And represented in that three million years of that would be hunter-gatherers, 10,000 years of that would be farmers, and, depending on your family, for my family, it would just be the last two generations that haven\u2019t lived off the land. Mm-hmm. So you\u2019ve got a quarter of a million people that are your direct lineage, that if they could all speak the same language, they\u2019d all be able to sit down and talk about living off the land and jabber on, and on, and on. And it would just be me and my dad sitting there not knowing what to talk about. [laughter] Right. So, there\u2019s so much change that\u2019s happening right now. And we have to keep up with that spiritually. So the requirement to grow spiritually at the pace that we are growing technologically is absolutely necessary. I just want to come back to something I had in my notes. And I don\u2019t really know where it fits in here in the arc of this conversation, but you said, everybody\u2019s gorgeous, and everybody\u2019s also been hurt, and those two things all at once. And you have this song, \u201CBlessings,\u201D in the Light Chasers album. I mean, the thing is, what you went through with Kaidin, I guess, every parent, every night \u2014 my son is here tonight. He\u2019s 17. He\u2019s like a foot taller than me now. He\u2019s this big, strong hockey player. And still, I go into his room in the middle of the night when he\u2019s come home, or first thing in the morning\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026worried, is he OK? Mm-hmm. Right? Mm-hmm. And so that is this universal experience, and then the worst happened to you. But you have more children now, and you choose to get through the night to worry every night again, right? And I just \u2014 there\u2019s something very beautiful in you have this. And the Light Chasers album was after you had kind of come out the other end\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026of \u2014 or while \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say come out the other end, but walked through the grief. Mm-hmm. \u201CBless the children, safe sleeping\u2026 / Bless the parents, hearts aching. / Bless the wakeless on their journey. / Travel safely, travel safely. / We\u2019re the sleepless always searching, / Light chasing, light chasing.\u201D Yeah, that one \u2014 it\u2019s interesting that you bring that one up in that context, because that came \u2014 the line came in the middle of the night \u2014 Nova was born at that point, and there was so many sleepless nights where you\u2019d just almost couldn\u2019t let yourself fall asleep because that PTSD is there. Yeah. So, we were both \u2014 Connie and I were both going through that. And there was a night that was when Nova was a newborn and the next day was Kaidin\u2019s birthday, and we were both just so panicky, and couldn\u2019t sleep. And in the middle of the night, that line was just there. And I give thanks to whatever it is that lays those kinds of things just there. They\u2019re gifts, and I think when I was younger and I heard people talk about \u2014 artists talk about things not coming from themselves, it felt a little bit \u2014 it felt a little pompous, like, \u201COh, God\u2019s talking to you? Like, wow, you\u2019re so important.\u201D Yeah. But I think it\u2019s \u2014 I really feel that now, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me individually. I think everybody has that power to sit in silence, or be in a moment, and to hear things from \u2014 again, we know of two percent of the universe. There\u2019s 98 percent \u2014 now there\u2019s multiverses. This thing is huge. There\u2019s so much to be heard. And our bodies can be tools to hear that and put that out there. And all of us have the power to do that. And that line was a gift. Mm. It wasn\u2019t from me. So, I\u2019ve started asking this question recently when I\u2019m finishing an interview, how you have come through all the things that have happened to you, this life you\u2019ve lived \u2014 how you\u2019ve come to think about what it means to be human, which is obviously an enormous question. And so it\u2019s just how would you begin to talk about that? I did want to read \u2014 again, I\u2019ll read you back to yourself some beautiful lines that seem to me to start speaking to that, from \u201CThrough The Ages.\u201D \u201CI\u2019m done being stupid and worried and dramatic. I lay down my every disguise. / So if ever I can\u2019t see the magic around me, / please take my hands off my eyes.\u201D It\u2019s a wonderful thing. We should all ask the people who love us to do. \u201CPlease take my hands off my eyes.\u201D \u201CI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re from, but we came here to be. / We came here to be courageous.\u201D What would you add, in terms of what you\u2019re learning about what it means to be human? Looking back at the evolutionary discussion that we had earlier, if you continued to trace that lineage all the way back to the creation of life, us going back three million years to being on all fours, that\u2019s one percent of geologic time. There\u2019s so much more that\u2019s before that. And there\u2019s so much more before the creation of the earth. And who knows how many cycles the universe has gone through to get to the point that we\u2019re at right now. But now we\u2019re here, and we are incredibly advanced organisms who are not grasping our potential. And we have to be courageous about laying down our insecurities and our fears, and \u2014 in order to get to the point that we can really embrace that energy in us. There was a fact that I read. All of physical matter, as we know, is made of energy. And all physical matter can be converted back into energy. And it takes a tremendous amount of energy to make the smallest particle of matter. And so in the average human body, there\u2019s 7\u00D710 to the 18th power joules of energy. And that translates into 30 hydrogen bombs. Just this physical body right here, the energy in it, is equivalent to 30 hydrogen bombs I have right now. And that\u2019s my only guarantee. I don\u2019t know about tomorrow, but I have right now, and I\u2019ve got this power. What am I going to do with it? Mmm. OK. Craig Minowa, thank you so much. Thank you so much for Cloud Cult for being here. And this is not over. We\u2019re going to hear some more music. So here we go. I\u2019m leaving. Thank you, Krista. See you later. Yeah.
