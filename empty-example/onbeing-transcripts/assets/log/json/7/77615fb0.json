  "fullText": "I can never give up on the idea that we the people can organize and bring change because we did it, and we can continue to do it. I mean, one of the things about what we call the Civil Rights Movement that I think was so phenomenal is that folks weren\u2019t afraid to experiment. And I feel like we\u2019re in a fascinating time right now. I feel like I do see those experiments, so to speak\u2026because there\u2019s so much to be done there\u2019s so much to be done. Lucas Johnson is a 30-something minister who is bringing the art and practice of nonviolence into a new century, for new generations. Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons was one of the original Black Power feminists. Together, across generations, they bring little-remembered nuance of the civil rights movement into relief. It\u2019s history I discovered I scarcely knew; a messier, more human history that reveals how much more powerful we are, than we know, to bring the great lessons of that time into practice in our own. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Rev. Lucas Johnson was born into an army family in Germany, and grew up in coastal Georgia. He is a leader of the century-old International Fellowship of Reconciliation. Dr. Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons became a leader, while still in her teens, of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Today, she\u2019s a professor of religious studies at Florida State University, and a student of Sufism. She was raised by her grandmother, who\u2019d been a sharecropper and whose own mother had been a slave. I spoke with Lucas and Zoharah at NPR headquarters in Washington D.C. before events in Ferguson and beyond reignited racial anguish. But the perspective they offered that night has become, if anything, more necessary. So, Zoharah, you tell a story about your first awakening. You described that joyful family you grew up in and you\u2019ve described your own childhood as joyful and you were protected in many ways. Mm-hmm. Yes. So then you went to Spelman College. What year was that, \u201962? Yes. I went in \u201962. OK. Yeah. Howard Zinn is the head of the history department. Yeah. Right. So I always say it was such a setup, you know, because\u2026 What was a setup? I mean to get there at that time and first of all, it\u2019s important to note that my grandmother had made me swear up and down that I wasn\u2019t going to get involved in the movement, and I said, \u201COh, no. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not.\u201D And I really meant it. You know, I really did. You know, I was so glad to be going to college. And then as \u2014 you know, I was told to get myself into a church as soon as I got there. So of course, there was this big nice church right up the street which was, you know, Reverend Abernathy\u2019s church. So I joined that church, having no idea who he was. Right. And then \u2014 so the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\u2026 Is right around the corner. OK. And what I \u2014 I should\u2019ve known this but I found this clarity in your writing about the particular focus that SNCC had, that it was focused on building organizations and concepts of leadership in the Deep South. Yes, you know, SNCC evolves into moving from being a student-based group growing out of the sit-in movements to then becoming a group that\u2019s borrowing in to communities and, you know, living with the people and helping to develop the leadership potential. Yeah. You know, I mean, one thing I noticed in an essay you wrote about, you know, about your story of those years\u2026 Yes. \u2026is you told the story about getting ready for the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer. Yes. And you didn\u2019t mention the March on Washington. Yeah. Well, first of all, I certainly wanted to go. OK. But my grandmother wouldn\u2019t let me. All right. So, you know, because at that point I was not letting on that I had gotten involved in the movement. So I couldn\u2019t tell my grandmother why I wanted to go. Yeah. It was just like, \u201CEverybody\u2019s going,\u201D and there were buses going from the various churches. That\u2019s always a very convincing reason for parents. Yes. Yes. Exactly. \u201CEverybody\u2019s doing it, Mom.\u201D But she said, \u201CNo. There\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble up there and you don\u2019t need to go.\u201D So because I kind of want to move into the present, I want to fast forward a little bit on the evolution of SNCC. Mm-hmm. Which was fairly dramatic. Yes. And here\u2019s one way you wrote it very succinctly. \u201CSNCC evolved from a movement whose symbols was two hands \u2014 one black and one white \u2014 clasped together to one whose rallying cry became \u2018Black Power\u2019 and its logo became the Black Panther.\u201D OK. Now, you\u2019re really kind of squishing time, right? OK. OK. Yes, we\u2019re squishing time. Yes, but we have to. But we\u2019ll keep talking about what it means. Yeah. I know, I know. Yeah. But\u2026 Yeah. So, you know, SNCC and me \u2014 we go through quite a bit there in Mississippi. Yeah. So, you know, first you\u2019ve got the three Mississippi workers who were killed. Yeah. So we do the Mississippi Freedom Summer. Many people stay on after \u2014 black and white stay on to work full time in Mississippi and other SNCC venues. Then the big thing I think that was a turning point for many of us was when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation went to the Democratic Convention which was held in Atlantic City. This is 1964. And we had put all of our effort into organizing the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, holding mock elections across the state, electing the delegates. And then the Democratic Party sells us out at the convention. I mean, we were na\u00EFve to have thought that our delegation would be seated because we didn\u2019t understand how politics worked. But it really hurt us so deeply because we were believing that we had done the right thing, and because you\u2019d done the right thing, the Democratic Party is going to do the right thing. So I think for a lot of us, and I know for myself, this began to create a change in thinking as to wait a minute \u2014\u00A0what are we really up against here? And then you\u2019ve got the Malcolm X phenomenon. Yeah. Right. That impacts on a lot of us. So Yeah. Luke\u2026 So it was a lot. Let\u2019s \u2014 yeah. No, we\u2019ll keep drawing this out. All right. Let\u2019s pull Lucas in because one thing that I know \u2014 I heard from you when I first met you is that you grew up \u2014 one of the things that you said is that you probably heard Martin Luther King Jr. preach at around the same age that your parents heard him, but they heard him live and you heard him as history. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And that you got a bunch of mixed messages about him and about the legacy of that time. Well, I mean, it\u2019s strange. I mean, I feel like it\u2019s like \u2014 like I\u2019m still in Mississippi with Zoharah right now. I know. We could stay there all night. But I \u2014 so, yes. So my parents, you know, I grew up with \u2014 like, if there was down time in the house at some point there would be recordings of Dr. King\u2019s sermons that were played. Or if we were driving among road trips they would play Dr. King\u2019s sermons. And so it\u2019s like I grew up with his voice and Aretha Franklin and, you know, like, it\u2019s strange because I probably did grow up in some ways like I was around in the \u201960s just in that little way. But, yeah, it is interesting because I think that in my generation the dominant image of \u2014 the way people would talk about Dr. King and Malcolm X was a very oversimplified sort of paradigm and it was very, I think, problematic. I mean, many people would think of him as this \u2014 you know, as loved by white people and not a true champion for the cause and Malcolm X was the epitome of black masculinity and he was the one to really aspire to. I mean, these were not the messages from my parents but these were the messages from my \u2014 you know, growing up in the social context in\u2026 In the \u201980s and \u201990s. In the \u201980s. Yeah. Yeah. And the \u201990s. So, you and I were actually together at a gathering called Wild Goose Festival and there was a wide generational range. And I came to an event you did on non-violence, non-violent resistance, and there was a young man maybe about your age doing fabulous things in the world. And he talked about how for him the idea of non-violence, it sounds passive. I mean, what I\u2019ve come to understand from you and from John Lewis and others is it\u2019s not an absence but a presence. Yeah And the tradition that you\u2019re in \u2014 I also experienced you to see your lineage as even bigger and longer than the Civil Rights Movement. So. The Fellowship of Reconciliation. Gandhi. Right. Right. So I mean, oftentimes I think about what A. J. Muste, who was one of FOR\u2019s early leaders in the \u2014 FOR was founded around 1914 and Muste was a phenomenal pacifist. And he talked about \u2014 Muste would talk about a revolutionary pacifism, right? That was his expression and that was his way of describing this notion of direct engagement. Pacifism was not about neutrality while injustice was around you but it was about finding the courage to respond in love. And I think that it begins with a commitment to love. I describe it as a spiritual discipline, right, as something that requires a lot of internal work in order to see others as opponents but not enemies, to see others a part of the social transformation that you\u2019re seeking to create. Hmm. And so, you know, the people that I\u2019ve learned the most from in FOR\u2019s tradition include A. J. Muste and Howard Thurman and Vincent Harding and others. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in conversation on civil rights and social change with Rev. Lucas Johnson and Dr. Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons. The language of the beloved community as the goal was so central to Dr. King and certainly the early movement. I wonder how did the Black Power movement take up that image or wrestle with it or work with it. You know, where did this core value of love go? Or how did that evolve? Well, I think that it\u2019s important to see that this evolution \u2014 you know, it\u2019s that the story is told and I think it\u2019s quite true, even though I wasn\u2019t out there on the continuation of the Meredith March. And that is the march where Stokely Carmichael, after having been arrested, stands on a flatbed truck and says, you know, \u201CI\u2019ve been arrested 68 times and I am not going to be arrested anymore. What is it that we need? We need black power.\u201D And, you know, the crowd just goes- erupts. And of course this whole period has been so demonized and misunderstood historically and often people say, you know, Black Power killed the Civil Rights Movement and all of that. But it was an evolution. You know, people don\u2019t know that a delegation of SNCC people went to Africa after the Mississippi Summer Project and, again, they\u2019re smarting after what has happened in Atlantic City. And then they go to Africa and they visit Guinea, they visit Ghana. And more and more, the understanding became that this is more than a moral issue. This is more than getting white Americans to love us. This is about us sharing power. And so while it was stated, flamboyantly, arrogantly, and all of that, it really was a coming to some understanding about how this country operates and that groups have to exercise power in order to get some of the things that we were trying to get for people. And so, you know, even Dr. King said, you know, it\u2019s one thing to be able to go to a restaurant but if you don\u2019t have any money to buy that hamburger or more, you know, to sit down and have a nice four course dinner, it really doesn\u2019t matter. And this tension is still with us, right? Absolutely. Yeah. Well, it is. And I was \u2014 I mean, and I know that was a segue to the present to talk about what\u2019s still with us, but I\u2019m still thinking about the way that people seem not to deeply wrestle and understand with the positive identity formation that the Black Power movement also represented, right? And\u2026 So say some more about that as you understand it. Well, I mean,I benefit from it. I\u2019m, you know, this consciousness that enabled African-Americans, one, to imagine Africa as something that wasn\u2019t inherently negative, right, and to reclaim sort of a sense of afro-descendancy that they could be proud of, and that meant something. Even the fact that we now use the language of African-American. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. That, you know, I mean to no longer feel like they needed to be subservient to white people or white interest and to have an internal sense of pride that was not about a political achievement, right, that was rooted in something much deeper. And I think that if we don\u2019t understand that ,we run the risk of oversimplifying what, you know, the Black Power movement was about. In the face of the defeats of the Mississippi Freedom Summer, I mean, I \u2014 and Zoharah, you have to tell me and correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 but I see part of what the black power movement that came out of that experience is representing was an opportunity to root our struggle in something beyond a political victory. Right? Mm-Hmm. Well, that\u2019s a good point. I tell my students all the time and they fall out laughing, I said, \u201CYou know, when I was growing up when you called a black person an African you might get hit in the nose.\u201D It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was true with me growing up too. I mean, this was \u2014 no, but \u201CAfrica? I\u2019m no African. I grew up where the only movies that I saw was Tarzan. Remember? And Cheetah had more sense than the Africans. So we have to remember what was going on. Yeah. And isn\u2019t it fascinating\u2026 The denigration of black people. \u2026that this language that we now use all the time carries such weight. Yeah. And we don\u2019t know that. Yes. And so as Lucas is saying, I mean, you know, we had a whole lot to deal with because we\u2019re talking about a culture that has denigrated black people, made us ashamed of everything \u2014 your hair, the shape of your nose, the size of your lips. I mean everything you hate because you\u2019ve been taught to hate. And this is why Malcolm was so amazing. You know, because he said that to us and I just, you know, want to say that in Laurel, Mississippi, you know, we had built with the community, had taken this boarded up building and built this beautiful center and the Klan firebombed it and it was burned down. Now, I\u2019m sitting in this partially burned out place and that\u2019s \u2014 nobody would rent us anything else. And the mail comes. In the mail is a record of Malcolm X. I\u2019d never heard of Malcolm. And we have a little record player there and I put the record on and Malcolm X is talking about the ballot or the bullet. And I\u2019ve never heard anything like this. I am totally mesmerized. I\u2019m scared to even listen to it, it\u2019s so incendiary, you know, compared to anything else I know. But I\u2019m so struck by it. So this is another thing that you have to know is going on in other parts of the country, that people \u2014 and so this also is seeping down into the South. And I think in many ways it was not done well. I think a lot of, you know, what came out of Rap Brown\u2019s mouth, \u201CWe\u2019re going to burn it down,\u201D I mean, it was unfortunate, you know. But it was heated rhetoric and basically nobody really meant to do that but nonetheless, it was said and it was unfortunate because it frightened people. And then, you know, we have all this history to deal with without an understanding of what this comes out of, what it represents \u2014 an evolution of a people coming to a consciousness of who they are and a pride in who they are. And I mean, I feel like one of the other points related to that is that I feel like when people describe Malcolm X or when people describe the Black Panther Party, they often describe what the Panthers and Brother Malcolm were saying what they were willing to do as if it was what they preferred to do. Right? I mean, they were saying we were willing to be violent. Right. Right. Right. We were willing to respond, you know, if we had to. But that\u2019s very different than saying \u201CWe prefer violence.\u201D Right? And I feel like that\u2019s another point that gets, I don\u2019t know, somewhere in the \u201980s and \u201990s got distorted or lost or something happened. But I feel like that there\u2019s a popular conception of these movements and these folks as more violent than they actually were, right? And I think that\u2019s another \u2014 problematic here. So there\u2019s something interesting I hear. So, Lucas, Zoharah, you\u2019re older but you are part of this \u2014 just the Fellowship of Reconciliation. I mean, you kind of identify with this centuries-old movement that carries many of these values, the values of non-violence and social transformation before the Civil Rights Movement and into it and beyond it. And now you are bringing us even into places like Congo and Palestine today. And representing that in this country. I kind of hear you saying that you integrate all of this, including that willingness, this memory of that place that the movement got to. I mean, so that the philosophy of non-violence itself has evolved. I think it\u2019s interesting that Dr. King\u2019s favorite scholar was Hegel, right? Or favorite philosopher was Hegel, right? Central to \u2014 Dr. King\u2019s philosophy was Hegelian dialectic, right? This tension. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Exactly. Exactly. I remember that. Yeah. Right? You know, so that\u2019s, you know, Dr. King talks about a tough mind and a tender heart, right? And I feel like there are lots of tensions within non-violence, right, as a commitment, as a way of working out the struggle for justice. There\u2019s lots of\u2026 It\u2019s a way of being rather than just withholding. Exactly. Yes. Exactly. As a way of being. There are lots of tensions within it and, yeah, those tensions include a tension between the struggle for justice and the commitment to love, right? They include attention between recognizing a tremendous amount of violence being acted upon someone and the desire to sort of stop that violence and the willingness or the interest in stopping that violence even while loving the perpetrators of that violence. Right. Right, right. So there\u2019s a lot of tensions within it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It can\u2019t be wrapped up neatly in a bow. No. No. No. And it\u2019s a lot \u2014 I mean, and it\u2019s hard, right? And I feel like there seems to be this culture I think sometimes in some places that I\u2019ve experienced within the peace movement, particularly, of not wrestling deeply, right, with fear, with concerns, with justice. I think we have a responsibility. We have an obligation to wrestle more deeply than we sometimes do. You can listen again and share this conversation with Lucas Johnson and Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons through our website, onbeing.org. Coming up\u2026 their wisdom on how we can move and heal our society in our time as the Civil Rights movement galvanized its own. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today deromanticizing the civil rights movement and the models of social change it left with us. Dr. Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons was an original Black Power feminist and a grassroots leader of the Mississippi Freedom Summer. Reverend Lucas Johnson is a leader of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation, which was founded in the early 20th Century. We spoke together in a public event at NPR headquarters in 2013 and we opened our conversation up for questions from the audience. It\u2019s a privilege to hear you. I\u2019m David Hirsch and I\u2019d like to paraphrase Vincent Harding in the form of a question. It\u2019s clear that you have been willing to hear the call and you are watering the seed of the trees of American life. It really grows in your own hearts. And I wonder if you could articulate the one America that you now dream and hope for. I think that also gets at what is the movement now? Where are we now? You know, Krista when you began you described sort of all the anniversaries that we\u2019ve experienced and they\u2019ve been cause for a lot of reflection for me. I mean, you know, I live benefiting from the work that Zoharah and many others did. I grew up in an integrated community. I grew up with friends from \u2014 well, one, in the U.S. Army you have this very \u2014 you oftentimes have a beautifully integrated context with white kids and black kids and Puerto Rican kids and Korean kids, and that was a part of my life. But then there was also that part of my life where I was living in southeast Georgia and, you know, I remember being confronted early on by the n-word and so on and so forth. What was different was that the power behind those insults was not the same as what you had to experience, Zoharah, and those people that called me that in the third grade became my friends by the seventh grade. And we loved each other and we were able to become friends and some of those folks I\u2019m still friends with. Right? But that didn\u2019t stop Renisha McBride from being shot. And it didn\u2019t stop Jordan Davis from being shot or Trayvon Martin. You know, I hope that what we\u2019re working towards and the vision for the United States that has not yet been is one where certainly those things don\u2019t happen and certainly our incarceration rate wouldn\u2019t be what it is. And it\u2019s hard to even see what that America would look like. It\u2019s hard to even imagine. I know when I experience it, but to try to describe it in some big way is still hard for me. You know, in some ways maybe I\u2019m working towards something that I can\u2019t quite imagine but I know it when I see it, you know? You know, there\u2019s a question that arises and I feel like it\u2019s been around the edges of some of the things you\u2019ve both been saying about how social change happens now. You know, because it\u2019s also hard to imagine in this world we inhabit the kind of focus on a leader like Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela. It\u2019s hard to imagine the kind of mass movement. Even \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Lucas, I know you wrote at some point that you sometimes felt envious of the clarity of focus that the civil rights activists and leaders had in the \u201960s but, you know, when you tell the real story beneath the surface it was very complicated. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I don\u2019t think a movement is going to work that way now. And I wonder how does change happen now? What adaptations do you see? I mean, one of the things about what we call the Civil Rights Movement that I think was so phenomenal is that folks weren\u2019t afraid to experiment, right? And really, I think that what was\u2026 It\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re describing, all of that experimentation. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean there was lots of experimentation. And I feel like we\u2019re in a fascinating time right now. I feel like I do see those experiments, so to speak. I do see pockets of experimentation or pockets of resistance to unjust systems or dehumanizing aspects of American life. I think that it\u2019s probably going to be lot more, in terms of what a new movement would look like, it will probably necessarily be a little bit more diffuse, you know? Because there\u2019s so much to be done. There\u2019s so much to be done. And, you know, my elders, Zoharah included, for me I\u2019ve often heard \u2014 used other language to describe the Civil Rights Movement, right? The movement for the expansion of American democracy or the southern freedom movement. And I think that the importance in that language is that it describes a struggle that is ongoing and that is much bigger than a particular political effort. Because I think that there\u2019s an innate humanness about our problems and our struggle to address them that we have to be working at and committed to overcoming. Let\u2019s take another question. Hi. My name is Fatemah Keshavarz and I think one thing that came out of the conversations is, as Krista pointed out, that this movement has been deeply spiritual. And I also hear the Dr. Zoharah Simmons has a Sufi background. And of course, for the Sufis there\u2019s a struggle between not surrendering to resistance, even subversion, at the same time complete acceptance and love, this tension there. I wonder if when that came for you was that in an early stage? Or did it play \u2014 did your Sufi practice play any role in your role in the movement, with your own personal growth, if you care to comment on that. Thank you. So Fatemah Keshavarz is a very renown scholar of Rumi. Oh, OK. Wow. And it\u2019s such an interesting question. It is. And I was intrigued to hear that you were Sufi also because we know about the nation of Islam, although that\u2019s actually such an interesting story. The nation if Islam evolved so much and I don\u2019t feel like that story came down. But, yeah, this question of Sufism and how that played into your evolution. Well, first of all, I met a Sufi master or teacher in 1971. So it was after I had become a civil rights, human rights activist. And interestingly, first of all, you know, I grew up as a Baptist in a very, very Baptist home. And all my family, you know. You were just trouble. I know, I know. So \u2014 but even early on I had questions that I now understand that were always there, you know, about who are we? Why are we really here? What is this all about? Because now thinking about it, I saw a lot of poverty and suffering. And I was like, you know, in church I\u2019m hearing how good God is and all of this. And I\u2019m like, well, why is God letting this happen? You know, what is really going on here? So those questions had been a part of me for a long time. But then in 1971, I meet a person. I learn about a person who his student was studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania and he needed some Americans to help him bring his Sufi master to the United States, Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyadeem, and when I heard about this teacher I thought, \u201CHmm, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking for, somebody who had some insights into the, you know, these things that are bothering me and have been for so many years.\u201D Now, once he came and I started going and listening to him and all, I thought, \u201COh, my. If I\u2019m going to embark on this Sufi path, this journey, the inward journey, does it mean I have to give up the outward struggle?\u201D And that was a big problem for me. And I can say I really grappled with it for quite a while. I mean to the point of tears, because the movement and the struggle was such a part of my life that I said I can\u2019t give this up for anything. But on the other hand, what he was teaching me about the soul and why we really had come was also very appealing. So there\u2019s that tension that exists still to this day after all these years. I\u2019m still grappling with those two things. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in conversation on civil rights and social change with Rev. Lucas Johnson and Dr. Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons. Another question? Hi. I work in the southwest neighborhood of D.C. and one of the many things that I do is that I work with children after school. And the context that I see children coming from is, in many cases, violence in various ways. There\u2019s domestic violence, there\u2019s gang activity in the neighborhood, and there\u2019s also just that their experience in a lot of ways in school and in life is sort punitive. And the kids then sort of play that out in their relationships with each other. And I just wonder what is there \u2014 what\u2019s the practical application of the non-violent spirit in that situation? And is there anything that someone like me, who feels deeply unqualified can do. And then the other aspect of that, that struck me, Dr. Simmons, when you were speaking is that those of us in my generation and Lucas\u2019 generation have seen kind of the Civil Rights Movement as having this kind of halo around it. But when you describe being a young student, I suspect to maybe that generation it looked like an awful lot of rebellion and fuss and trouble. And how do we channel what sometimes looks like to the establishment of our generation as, like, the rebellion and fuss and trouble of the kids coming up into this sort of non-violent social justice paradigm? Wow. That\u2019s a hard question. And, I mean, I really feel where your question is coming from because it\u2019s certainly something that I am deeply troubled by, deeply. And, you know, I think on the individual level what we can do and certainly what I try to do when I\u2019m around young people, first of all, is love them and let them know that I am and you are in their corner. And to let them know that they can come to you and even though you might not be able to change the actual, you know, structures in which they are living for them to know that you love them and that you care for them is very, very important. But we also have to have structural changes and this is where I can never give up and I think that\u2019s because of having come through the movement, having been born in the Jim Crow South. And Lucas and I were talking about this last night: How do you come from, you know, 1964 Mississippi to where we are now? And I\u2019m not in any way Pollyannaish about where we are now. We have a lot of problems. But I never thought I would live to see the day that there would be a black man in the White House. I mean, that to me was absolutely impossible. So, you know, there are changes even though there are so many problems still. So I can never give up that, on the idea that we the people can organize and bring change. That I just \u2014 I know we can because we did it. And because we did it we can continue to do it. But at the individual level we have to give them love. So that that becomes somewhat of a balm for the bruises, for the pains, that they are suffering. And it\u2019s very little but I think it does help while we are building the structural changes, the institutions, that we must build, to change the reality for these children. Lucas? I\u2019m not letting you off the hook. Oh, man. I was like yeah. Well, the first thing I want to say is that you called yourself not qualified or not able and that\u2019s not true. The second thing is I was reflecting on \u2014 you described several different layers of the problem. And I think that we have to recognize that we can\u2019t always address all the layers at the same time and we have to focus on what we can do. I do believe that sometimes, unfortunately, our schools are more like traps than centers of education and learning. But I think that every little effort from every teacher, from every person that can give that effort will help those children along, will help your students along. And I\u2019m grateful for teachers and particularly those teachers in my life who did that. There is something very important about the perspective that\u2019s provided. I mean, this sense that the questioner had, that I think so many of us have, of the insurmountability of the structural problems. And this feeling of not being qualified. You know, and then we look back at this monolithic, successful \u2014 right? But I mean you describe the absolute complexity and the insurmountability of the structural problems was arguably at least as great as it is now. And there\u2019s something helpful just about remembering that. That maybe also gets lost when we celebrate the milestones, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean, we celebrate the accomplishment. Mm-hmm. Let\u2019s take another question. Thank you so much. My name is Lisa Sharon Harper. I have a few thoughts and then I have two questions. And the first thought has to go back to our earlier conversation about Black Power and recently in our history we have three films that I think really do a beautiful job and a powerful job of explaining the African-American male\u2019s experience in America and why that call for Black Power would actually rise out of the soul of black men. \u201C12 Years a Slave,\u201D \u201CThe Butler,\u201D and \u201CFruitvale Station,\u201D all three of which you just see immense, immense amount of control that are put on black men in particular. Now, flash forward to today and we have the Voting Rights Act being chucked with the section four being diminished. We have the Stand Your Ground and Stop and Frisk. We have mass incarceration. The question is in today\u2019s context, what can nonviolence -the non-violence strategy of the \u201960s, teach us about how to engage with issues like immigration reform, like economic disparity like the president talked about recently? And then what are the ways that the \u201960s Civil Rights Movement, maybe that context isn\u2019t like this context? And so what are the challenges that that strategy would meet in this current context? Take one of those questions. Wow, right? Well, I think that we are seeing movements arise and I agree with you because the Civil Rights Movement initially was dealing with the lack of rights on the books, you know, and we\u2019re not dealing with that now. So we\u2019re dealing with very different things. I\u2019m very involved with the Dream Defenders down in Florida. Right. I\u2019m glad we \u2014 that got mentioned. Yes. Yes. And a number of my students are leaders in the Dream Defenders. And so they are working on the school to prison pipeline and this is something that I think we need to be working on across the country because it is a huge issue. The question is how do we as people of conscience, people of faith, how do we galvanize ourselves to take these issues on? Because I believe that we are in the majority, but for some reason we are fragmented. Maybe because we have so many issues that we are taking on. How do we make an umbrella over all of these groups so that we become united in our effort to bring about the change that I believe the majority of Americans want in this country? So I was going to say, one of the things that, you said so much that I want to speak to, but one of the things that I was going to mention was the fact that I think that we have to understand that our struggle is not just our own. And I feel like when you look back at the Civil Rights Movement I think one of the ways that that story is under-told is by the diversity of perspectives that came. I feel like there\u2019s a way that, because many different organizations were black organizations, that the nuance gets lost, the diversity gets lost, because everybody was black. Right? But, you know, the brotherhood of\u2026 The diversity within the diversity. The diversity within the diversity. Yes. The Brotherhood of the Sleeping Car Porters was not the same as the NAACP. It was not the same as SCLC. It was not the same as, you know, the list goes on. And you have the intersections with peace movement and so on and so forth. And I think that if you look at, you know, the Moral Mondays movement in North Carolina, for example, and you look at what was working well, it\u2019s in part because coalitions were built and people were able to organize together. And so I feel like that\u2019s one of the ways that we\u2019ve got to start thinking and struggling. And, yeah, that\u2019s my one answer to those questions. I think we just have time for one more question. I had a stroke a few years ago. But in 1970 I found a copy of Fellowship magazine, the Fellowship of Reconciliation magazine. And that issue had the statement of purpose. And I signed it and I figure when I get to Heaven I\u2019ll know what really pacifism is. But Lucas, I just wanted you to tell how you first became a pacifist. Hmm. That\u2019s sweet. I \u2014 it\u2019s been a journey. You know? In some ways I feel like I\u2019m still becoming a pacifist. But I can tell so many sort of early stories that moved me along that journey but I think that I reached this point where I felt like there was \u2014 when you ask who is it OK to kill or whose mother deserves to grieve, you know, the answer is no one and no mother. And I think that I reached that conclusion early on. When Dr. King gave his sermon \u201CBeyond Vietnam\u201D at Riverside Church in 1967, you know, he talked about on one hand we\u2019re called to be the Good Samaritan and on the other hand we\u2019re called to transform the Jericho Road and change the edifice that produces beggars. And when I first read those words I felt a call to do edifice-changing work in the same tradition that Dr. King was speaking of. And I think that\u2019s how I found myself on this journey. And I can tell you more stories later but that\u2019s the best answer I can give right now. You know, I wish we had hours and I have pages of questions we haven\u2019t gotten to but where we have gone is so rich. And mostly it leaves wonderful questions in the room for us to hold and live with and reflections and nuance, that\u2019s new. I think in my work it\u2019s become more and more important to me that spiritual life at its best is reality-based and the two of you embody it. So I want to thank you so much for being with us tonight and sharing\u2026 Thank you. \u2026what you know and what you lived. Thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming.
