  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CInside Mormon Faith.\u201D My guest, Robert Millet, is a leading scholar and lifelong member of the Church of Latter-day Saints. We\u2019ll explore spiritual and doctrinal basics which are rarely clarified when Mormon history and religion enter political debates. We discover distinct ideas about the nature of God, family, and eternity, and a young frontier tradition which continues to develop internally. We\u2019re in the religion-making business, and this takes time. It takes centuries. And trying to explain the faith and articulate the faith, that doesn\u2019t come over night. We\u2019ve really only been about that for 20 or 30 years. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Americans have been hearing a lot about Mormonism in the context of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. But we\u2019re learning about this faith of 30 million people indirectly, by way of rhetoric and defense. This hour, we\u2019ll avoid well-trodden controversial ground. We\u2019ll seek an understanding of core beliefs and spirituality of Latter-day Saints with a leading scholar of the church and a lifelong practitioner. He describes a developing young religion with distinct, mystical, and practical interpretations of the nature of God, family, and eternity. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CInside Mormon Faith.\u201D The formal name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints begins to tell its story. It is a new religion, a bearer of latter-day revelation. Its founder, Joseph Smith, was born in Vermont in 1805 and grew up in a world of populist religious ferment, the era of the Second Great Awakening of Protestant Christianity. Abolitionists, suffragists, and utopian social experiments were on the rise along with a sense that established Christianity had lost its original transformative character. In that context, Joseph Smith reported a series of revelations over a period of 21 years that would complete and restore the original impulse of Jesus in the earliest centuries of Christianity. Alongside the Bible, Mormons honor a number of sacred texts that Joseph Smith is believed to have received and translated by way of visions and encounters with heavenly beings. Today, the Church of Latter-day Saints, or LDS, has an extensive hierarchy of authority, including a presidency, a Council of Twelve Apostles, and a First Quorum of Seventy. My guest, Robert Millet, has been a scholar of ancient scriptures and religious understanding at Brigham Young University since 1983, and he\u2019s twice served as a bishop or communal religious leader. His personal religious history is also very much representative of the newness and missionary impulse of this faith. An estimated 65 percent of Mormons, globally, are first-generation converts, as was Robert Millet\u2019s mother and his paternal grandfather. They lived in a small, close-knit Mormon community in Louisiana. The earliest memories I have, it\u2019s community. It\u2019s lay ministry where the person, you know, above and beyond job and home, they\u2019re spending their hours teaching, or building a new church, or whatever it was. I gave myself in those early years to projects and to ideas and to working with people who loved what I loved. And so that, to me, is at the heart of it. And I think that that example, that kind of witness of strong community and strong family, is very much a part of the appeal that this tradition is having for people\u2026 Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. \u2026globally, right? In addition to, or sometimes maybe even before, any kind of doctrinal or theological understanding. No, I think that\u2019s right. I think people feel something among the people. I think there are probably theological underpinnings to the way we live. In other words, we can give, and people have requested, we can give instructions on how to conduct a Monday family-home evening, you know? Right. We can give instructions on how to make your young people\u2019s program successful. In other words, there\u2026 Right. \u2026there\u2019s no formula for how to do it and make it work without the doctrine. Well, you know, let\u2019s get into that. Let\u2019s talk about that. You know, your image of God, you know, I\u2019m very intrigued, as I get into the literature and read your books, that, you know, there really is quite a very particular way of thinking about the nature of God, you know, that there are different names for God in the original Hebrew in the Bible. Yeah. And my understanding is that for Mormons, you know, those different names of God are really about distinct manifestations of God or distinct gods. Well, for example\u2026 So Elohim is a God the Father, right? Sure. Elohim would be God the Father. Jehovah or Yahweh would be the premortal Jesus Christ. And Elohim, God the Father, you understand to be a corporeal being who was once a man, like us? Yeah \u2014 yeah, let me address at least\u2026 Correct me when I need correcting. No. Yeah. What I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to address what I think we know and what I think we don\u2019t know. OK. I think many people, in an effort to try to bring some kind of image in their minds to deity, no one wants to feel they\u2019re praying to a force. Right, imagine a person. Yeah, a gas. They imagine a person, of course. And so the notion that we teach that God is corporeal or physical, it doesn\u2019t strike an interested, curious seeker as overly odd because they often comment, \u2018Well, I think I\u2019ve sort of anticipated that.\u2019 But I mean, and my sense is that this understanding of God is a product of something like a spiritual evolution of God who was once a man and moved into this very different kind of being. Godhead. Yeah. Well, Joseph Smith taught that in 1844. And other presidents of the church, like Lorenzo Snow, taught about it. But you know, it\u2019s talked about so little, so infrequently. I hear much, much more of that teaching from those who are outside the LDS faith than I do from people within. And I guess the answer is for this \u2014 do I believe that? Yes, because I think it\u2019s part of the faith. But it\u2019s rather theologically tangential in the sense that we believe he\u2019s a man. What went on before he was God, we just have no idea. In other words, that lies in the realm of the mysterious for us just as the final explanation for trinity would with traditional Christians. And I don\u2019t have difficulty with that at all. And I think what that creates with Latter-day Saints is a greater sense of closeness. You know, I think some kind of Christians find in the figure of Jesus, through the figure of Jesus, that closeness to God, right? Yes. That sense of God made flesh. But even as you \u2014 someone might read a simple explanation of this and say that God is less exalted. I mean, they say that, in some ways, your understanding of Jesus seems to be more exalted. I mean, you very much stress Jesus as, in fact, originally Yahweh or Jehovah\u2026 Yes. \u2026who is already there in the beginning, the early chapters of Genesis, the God of the ancients, in fact, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Let me say it this way. OK. Krista, I was in a meeting, oh, maybe a year ago with one of the Mormon apostles, present-day leaders of the church, and with a group of about 20 Evangelical pastors. One of the questions that came up \u2014 interestingly enough, this will have very recent application \u2014 one of the heads of Calvary Chapel said, \u201CNow, elder so-and-so, isn\u2019t it true that you believe that Jesus and Lucifer are brothers?\u201D And I was very\u2026 The remark that Mike Huckabee made recently about it. That\u2019s right. That was Mike Huckabee\u2019s remark the other day. And he said this. He said, \u201CWell, it is true. You need to understand we believe that before we were born, we all, not just Jesus, but that we all lived in a premortal existence. And yes, Jesus and Lucifer,\u201D he said, \u201Cwere in that world together.\u201D But let me be straightforward on this. Jesus was God, and there was never a time when He and Lucifer were on the same plane. OK. Now, that\u2019s a kind of mystery in itself for us, if you will, Krista, because it\u2019s, we believe that Jesus is the \u2014 Jehovah was the firstborn spirit son of God. And yet, we believe that Jesus became God and was with God and was God. We have no problem with John 1. The Book of Mormon, in fact, on the title page, calls Him the Eternal God. Mormon scholar Robert Millet. This is a traditional hymn about Jehovah, who Mormons understand to be the creator God who also chose to become Jesus of Nazareth. It\u2019s sung by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, we\u2019re exploring some basic doctrinal and spiritual underpinnings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Mormon Church has a distinct and developed belief, not only in life after death, but life before life. Church founder and prophet Joseph Smith described a premortal existence through which every human being passes. In what he called this first state of existence, men and women live as spirits, sons and daughters of God, and are spiritually prepared for the second state of life in human form on Earth. I asked Robert Millet about this. There used to be a film that the church produced called Man\u2019s Search for Happiness, and some of the lines went like this: \u201CYou did not suddenly just flare into existence at the time of birth, but rather, you have always lived.\u201D For us, that answers many of the questions that people often have relative to a sense or a feeling of another time and another place, a kind of spiritual d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu, if you will. We would not believe, for example, in the reincarnation of souls, but we would believe that people\u2019s sense that they once lived before is a very real sense, and that that\u2019s what that was about, that we prepared there for here. And that that idea, you know, one of my colleagues is just finishing a book with Oxford on the prevalence of the notion of preexistence across cultures. And while it was condemned by the, oh, I guess the fifth or sixth century by the mother church, it is found throughout cultures all over the world, the idea of a life before life. You know, you quoted in your book on the Mormon faith the church\u2019s first presidency in 1909. And the statement was that \u201Cthe doctrine of preexistence revealed so plainly, particularly in the latter days, pours a wonderful flood of light upon the otherwise mysterious problem of man\u2019s origin.\u201D I found that a very evocative statement. I\u2019m not sure I understand it. Is this doctrine illuminating for you in terms of the mysterious problem of man\u2019s origin? Well, it is in this sense that, I mean, I had, we\u2019ve had, my wife, Shauna, and I have had six children. We now have seven grandchildren. And I \u2014 children are as different as night and day. Yeah, yes. I mean, the idea that we lived before we came, the idea that I, before I was born or before my children or grandchildren were born, that they were real, actual personalities, and that, to some extent, they bring those personalities and attributes and qualities and characteristics with them, that has a sobering effect on parenthood. You know, I look at my children very differently than if I just believe they were born, they came along at the time of their birth. And so it has a kind of an eternalizing effect upon family relationships, the ability to see my children as someone who, for all I know, could have very well been my superior in another world, in another time and place, and so I\u2019d better treat them properly. Definitely, they\u2019re, in that spiritual sense, my brothers and sisters. Do you see what I mean? And Jesus is the Son of God, but is there also, in Mormon teaching, a sense of God having a family? Is there any kind of heavenly reflection of the maternal or mother role or mother figure? There is. There is within Mormonism, although we know very little about this too, the concept of a mother in heaven. OK. It was first presumably taught by Joseph Smith, though we can\u2019t find it in any sermons, but was reflected in a hymn written by Eliza R. Snow entitled \u201COh, My Father,\u201D in which she speaks of not only a father, but a mother there. You won\u2019t hear Latter-day Saints talking a great deal about it because we don\u2019t know much about it. OK. But, yeah, the family order, what we would say is the family order on this Earth, is a better reflection of the family order as it existed before we came to this Earth. I\u2019d like to also ask you about angels. There\u2019s quite a developed understanding within Latter-day Saint theology of angels. Now, Joseph Smith, in 1823, reported being visited by the Angel Moroni. Is that where angels enter into this faith? Mm-hmm. Yes, Joseph Smith put forward a belief in angels that\u2019s quite different from, let\u2019s say, traditional Christianity or Judaism. For us, angels are not a different creation than human beings. And that is\u2026 Can you explain that? What does that mean? Yeah. What that means is angels may take the form, they may be persons who have not yet lived as a mortal. They may be persons who have lived as a mortal and who are allowed to return. In other words, they can be both unembodied and disembodied persons that appear, or they could be persons who come back with a physical body, resurrected beings. And so, for us, angels are not a different realm of creation. For us, if someone appears to me to give instructions, warning, whatever, from the other side of the veil that separates this world from the next, it would be someone who had lived or will live. And so, I mean, do you, would you say that, in your lifetime, you\u2019ve encountered angels or that you\u2019ve had experiences that you later explained in that way? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I\u2019ll just say it this way, that my grandfather was a very noble and god-fearing man. And you know, there are some things that are very personal, but I have felt grandpa\u2019s influence through the years. My father passed away in 1988, and dad and I were very, very close. I don\u2019t have any hesitation in saying that I believe that dad continues to live, that I believe in the immortality of the soul, and that, and I guess I would say it this way. A friend of mine told me that when his grandfather was getting very aged, he called the family together and, to bid goodbye because he knew he was going to pass. And then he said to them, and this would be, I think, a very typical LDS way of looking at things. He said, \u2018I\u2019m going to die soon, but when I die, I shall not cease to love you. I shall not cease to pray for you, and I shall not cease to minister in your behalf.\u2019 Now, we take that seriously. Right. And so I think I could say because my dad continued to live in Louisiana and I left Louisiana and came West, as it were, and we would see them once or twice a year, I think I can honestly say that my dad\u2019s influence in the last 20 years has been far greater than it was in the 20 years before he died. It\u2019s something we take very seriously that I cannot imagine that when I die, whenever that is, that I will stop feeling and thinking toward those I loved, that I spent 30, 40, 50, 60 years loving here. And so an LDS perspective would be, we not only don\u2019t cut off all relationships at death, but that we seek to be worthy of having those relationships continue after death. Mormon scholar Robert Millet. The Church of Latter-day Saints observes core communal sacraments of Catholic and Protestant Christianity, such as baptism and communion or the Lord\u2019s Supper. Worship and extensive doctrinal instruction take place in meetinghouses and in families. Some exclusively Mormon sacraments, such as the sealing of marriages for eternity, are enacted in Mormon temples, which are closed to all but members of the church in good standing. Ritual clothing is worn, and strict confidentiality is observed. There are 124 temples in 42 countries across the world. The temple is the place \u2014 we\u2019re differing from a meeting house or a church house \u2014 where ordinances or sacraments are performed, not only for time, but for eternity, including both the sealing of a husband and a wife and a family, but also, and this is where one of the most unusual and often criticized of our beliefs, the doctrine of work in behalf of the dead takes place. For example, my grandfather, my wife\u2019s mother died a Methodist. Now, we believe that when he goes into the next world, the world of spirits, the post-mortal existence, that he will be given a further opportunity to receive as much truth as he\u2019s willing to receive, and that\u2019s a personal choice, that\u2019s his agency. He may choose to remain just who he is, where he is, and stick with what he believes. But if he should choose to learn more, we believe that opportunity would be provided. And we therefore perform what are called vicarious ordinances, sacraments for people who have gone on. Now, do you understand the discomfort that people have with that? I do. And how do you respond to that? I do. I understand that, obviously, this was a very, has been a very touchy issue with the Jewish faith. One man said to me it\u2019s a spiritual Holocaust. Well, we don\u2019t want anybody to feel that way, and that\u2019s why the LDS Church has backed off of doing any work for Holocaust victims. But of course, I understand the discomfort. But I\u2019ll tell you what I think it does provide, Krista, that is not readily accessible. And it\u2019s been a part of our faith from the very beginning. I think it is the best possible answer to the question that is right up there with the problem of evil. And that\u2019s if your Christian, and if you believe that salvation comes only in Jesus and His name and power, then what of the bulk of humanity that will go to their graves without ever having heard of Him? And so the concept that life continues beyond this life, that learning continues after this life, and that the opportunity to receive requisite ordinances may continue after this life, that God has a way. And did this approach also originate from revelations that came to Joseph Smith? Are these things he saw and reported? That\u2019s correct. OK. It actually came, the beginnings of it came in 1836 with an experience he had. He reports being in the Kirtland, Ohio, temple, which still stands. And it was not yet finished, as far as being completed, the building, but they were meeting in it nevertheless. And in a meeting upstairs, Joseph Smith reported seeing a vision in which he saw, it\u2019s called the Vision of the Celestial Kingdom, the highest heaven. Joseph he said saw father Abraham, and he saw Adam. And then he said, \u201CI saw my brother, Alvin, who has long since slept.\u201D And by that he means Alvin had died in 1823 just before Moroni had come, but of course, seven years before the church was organized. We\u2019ve learned historically from sources that at the funeral for Alvin, that a particular minister, who was preaching the funeral\u2019s sermon, intimated very strongly that Alvin had gone to hell because he had not been baptized. Yeah. And that had just, it had infuriated Father Smith, but it had hurt the family. And so some 13 years later, in this vision, he sees Alvin. But Joseph Smith essentially asked the question every one of us would have asked, well, how can that be? In as much as he died many years before, the priesthood was restored, and the church was organized. And the answer came to him, and it\u2019s recorded in our doctrine and covenant as section 137, it\u2019s recorded, all those who would have received the gospel, if they had been permitted to live on, are heirs of the celestial kingdom. And so, only God-knowing hearts \u2014 and so that was the beginning of the revelation, what we call a vicarious work. It doesn\u2019t actually begin until about 1840, but from that point on, it\u2019s been a central teaching of the church. And that\u2019s one of the major reasons we build temples throughout the world. You know, I have to tell you that my first experience, and still absolutely the most dramatic experience I\u2019ve had of a Mormon temple, was in East Germany in the 1980s. Oh, my goodness. And it was\u2026 You were there then? I was there. It was a temple that was being built to serve Latter-day Saints across Eastern Europe. Yeah. It was the first temple in that part of the world. It was a very unusual thing that it was being allowed to be built. And I was covering this temple opening as a journalist. It was not in East Berlin. It was way down in the middle of nowhere and in an especially kind of bleak landscape of East Germany. And this temple, this white temple rising out of the ground looked completely otherworldly. Now, aren\u2019t there \u2014 isn\u2019t there a period of, is it 10 days where the temple is opened, and visitors can come in, and then it\u2019s closed? Varies by the temple. But they\u2019ll have a period of open house where visitors are welcome to come and see what it\u2019s going to be like. And they\u2019ll explain\u2026 I think this was 10 days. And there were people, there were lines going on for days. Yes. And I will also say that, you know, it was kind of a strange story that the East German government was allowing something like this. Yeah. And one of the things that was said is that, because a tenet of the Mormon faith is not only observing high moral standards, but honoring and sustaining the laws of the land. Yeah. And I believe that the Latter-day Saints in East Germany and in Eastern Europe had agreed to compromise somewhat on their missionary activities\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026because of this other value of respecting the laws of the land. I just want to ask you about that. Where does that come from? Is that theologically based? Is that a result of Mormon history? Respect. Yeah, respect for the laws of the land. Respecting the laws of the land. Yeah, it\u2019s an article of faith. One of our articles of faith is there will be\u2026 But you know, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t have let Pentecostals build a temple in the middle of East Germany. Well, you know, what we had to do \u2014 it really was important \u2014 is we had to build a reputation that we were trustworthy and that we would stay within the boundaries of the law. And I think, too, we had to convince them that we could help make their people better citizens of their nation. And that\u2019s one of the things we often speak. The church is very careful \u2014 in terms of missionary work in particular, but especially with temples \u2014 that we never sneak in the backdoor. Once we\u2019ve established the right relationships with the leaders of the nation and can convince them that what we have to bring to their people will make them even better citizens of their community, there\u2019s usually an opening, yeah. Mormon scholar Robert Millet. This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, a look inside the missionary impulse and experience of Mormonism and the importance of Joseph Smith\u2019s legacy. I love to see the temple. I\u2019m going there someday. I\u2019ll covenant with my Father. I\u2019ll promise to obey for the temple is a holy place where we are sealed together. As a child of God, I\u2019ve learned this truth: a family is forever. We\u2019ve been finding ways of including you in our production process at speakingoffaith.org.

Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CInside Mormon Faith.\u201D I\u2019m speaking with a leading scholar and lifelong member of the Church of Latter-day Saints, Robert Millet. We\u2019re exploring some basic tenets of the lived theology of this faith, which are rarely clarified amid politicized discussion of Mormon history and religion. We\u2019re not discussing ground that has recently been well trod in the context of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential candidacy. The church\u2019s history with race, for example, elicits criticism. Black men have only been ordained since 1978. Women have no place in official church leadership. And current DNA evidence does not confirm some of the historical claims of church founder Joseph Smith. Smith was a mercurial figure in his lifetime, only in part for the polygamy he eventually decreed a doctrine. Polygamy still figures largely in American imaginations about the Mormon faith, according to the Pew Research Center, though the practice was officially banned by the church in 1890. Controversies notwithstanding, Mormon faith is a growing global force. From 1.7 million members in 1960, the church now claims 13 million members, more than half of them outside the US. This growth is fueled by a tradition of missionary service. For example, an estimated 80 to 90 percent of young men from active LDS families spend time as missionaries. Many young women also serve, though at lower rates and later ages. Tell me about the importance of missionary work in your faith. And \u2014 I mean, I\u2019d really like for you to personalize that. I mean, talk about\u2026 Sure. \u2026your experience in this, and also maybe \u2014 you know, you\u2019ve raised six children\u2026 Yeah, yeah. What this means, what it really means, where were you sent? I was sent \u2014 yeah. I was sent to the foreign country of New York City. Oh, boy. It was called then the Eastern States Mission. The headquarters were in New York City on 973 Fifth Avenue. But at that point in time, it encompassed all of southern New York, all of New Jersey, all of Connecticut, and it encompassed western Massachusetts. But missionary work is sort of the life-blood of the church. There\u2019s nothing quite so exciting and contagious than a convert. They love what they have. They appreciate what they have. And they bring an enthusiasm with them that causes all of us to think back of when we first believed, and that\u2019s just invigorating. And so, it has very practical benefits, that\u2019s one. The other would be it\u2019s a tremendously valuable leadership training program \u2014 if you can appreciate that. I mean, in my case, I wasn\u2019t sent to a foreign country, but my son went to Brazil. He served in northern Brazil, which was not as established as, say, S\u00E3o Paulo, where the church is very strong. But in northern Brazil, in Bahia \u2014 and for him to be able to just walk down the streets and meet people, make appointments. He was a very shy son. He\u2019s, you know, he\u2019s a fun guy, but he\u2019s shy. And just to be able to learn to meet people, greet them, offer them something that matters to you, and teach them \u2014 I mean, he will tell you, it\u2019s one of the great moments in his life as far as, as one, cementing him in the faith. You come to love that which you serve. And also, in building the capacity \u2014 I mean, they had to know how to conduct church meetings. They had to know how to lead the singing. They had to know how to play the piano. You know, I would imagine, also, that you have a lot of experience of being rejected. I mean, with\u2026 No question about that. \u2026approaching strangers was something that they have not invited\u2026 Especially in New York City. \u2026yeah. I\u2019ll tell you what that does for you. It builds you emotionally so that you learn to deal with rejection later in life better. I mean, it would be \u2014 not have been uncommon in New York City, in the days when we could get into hotels. And you can\u2019t do that anymore. But in those days, in the 19 \u2014 the late \u201960s, which is when I was there, we would go to the top of an apartment complex and just go door to door in that complex. We might see one person who would dare open the door. They weren\u2019t sure who we were. And I look back and I can\u2019t blame them. And on the other hand, we also did things in Central Park. I mean, we\u2019d set up a panel board of some sort with the name of the church and a few pictures, and it was not uncommon. I\u2019ll tell you what else we did. We don\u2019t do this much as a church anymore, but I was only there two days when I was brought by my missionary companion to something I\u2019d never heard of, and it was called a street meeting. And we set up a soapbox that we would stand on right \u2014 it was on the corner of Wall Street and Nassau, which means it was right across the street from the stock exchange. And so, we get there about a quarter to 12:00. And at 12:00, the bell would go off for lunch, and it had become, I guess, by that time, a kind of a fun tradition that on Tuesdays, the Mormon missionaries were going to be across the street, and it was just astounding to me. I\u2019m \u2014 probably 200 people would come and just listen to us preach. And\u2026 And when was this? This would have been 1967\u201368. OK. And that\u2019s a growing experience. And I\u2019ll tell you what else it does. It causes you to really search your soul and ask hard questions like, \u2018Do I really believe this stuff? Am I willing to subject myself to humiliation or rejection or resentment by other people? And do I really believe this?\u2019 And I think it caused that kind of spiritual introspection to the point where I did a great deal of praying and thinking and pondering and reflecting. And so, there are very practical benefits to it. Obviously, we take the great commission of Jesus very seriously to go into all the world. Now, people will frequently ask us, \u2018But why do you go to Christians who already have a church, who already have a belief?\u2019 And, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just go to the heathen, you know?\u2019 And there\u2019s a practical answer for that. And that is \u2014 I\u2019ve had pastors ask me this, and I\u2019ve said to them, \u2018How large is your congregation?\u2019 \u2018Well, about 700.\u2019 \u2018When you look out at that congregation, can you literally tell at one glance who of all those people have truly been converted? Who of all those people have had a personal conversion experience? Who of all those people have been born again? Who of all those people have, in your language, accepted Jesus as their savior? Do you know in each case?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, no, of course not.\u2019 I said, \u2018Neither do we.\u2019 And so we approach everyone. I wonder \u2014 I mean, part of the idea that Joseph Smith presented that was pretty radical was that revelation was still happening. Yeah, opening, opening of the cannon. The cannon was closed, and yet the cannon was, perhaps, not fixed. It\u2019s been added to. He did his, in fact, some of his own translation of the Bible. And I think a minute ago we were talking about \u2014 you mentioned some ideas that are in Mormon teaching and doctrine and yet, and yet not much as really understood about them. Yeah. I wonder, you know, is revelation still happening and are there teachings that stop making sense at times or are there new ideas that arise\u2026 That\u2019s a very\u2026 \u2026that haven\u2019t been there historically? It\u2019s a very good question. In recent years, there\u2019s been an effort to, to try to solidify and codify, if you will, what actually constitutes Latter-day Saint doctrine. And that\u2019s caused us to ask hard questions like this: Is everything that was ever uttered by a church leader on a general level from the days of Joseph Smith, is that considered the doctrine of the church? And the answer has come back no. I\u2019ll give you an illustration. At the time, The Da Vinci Code was very hot and a little controversy raged over it. Yes. At the time it was raging, the church issued a very brief but insightful statement that I was appreciative for. It\u2019s just something that just\u2026 The Church of the Latter-day Saints? That\u2019s right. The Latter-day Saint leaders issued this statement. It just said essentially, \u2018The scriptures are silent as to whether Jesus was married. It is true that early church leaders may have offered their opinion on this matter, but those opinions did not then, nor do they now, constitute the doctrine of the church.\u2019 Now, that\u2019s a statement that\u2019s very important, because what it establishes is while Latter Day Saints revere and honor and respect and uphold their church leaders, we do not believe in a form of prophetic infallibility. And so we \u2014 as we, as we move into the 21st century now, and as we begin having a greater focus upon Christ and Christianity and Christian principles, I think there is a tendency to look back and say, \u2018All right, what are the central saving doctrines? And what are some other things we, A, don\u2019t know much about, B, just don\u2019t seem to be in harmony with what, with what \u2014 and where we are now? And I think that\u2019s taking place more and more. Mormon scholar Robert Millet. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CInside Mormon Faith.\u201D Well, you\u2019re, of course, also in an unusual position because you are really a relatively \u2014 in a very young tradition. And also, I mean, I \u2014 you know, and I would like to talk a little bit about the person of Joseph Smith. I mean, the truth is, we can know a lot more about him\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026 \u2026than we can know about other people in history who are called prophets. That\u2019s right. And, you know, I know that he, he reported revelations, and the stories sometimes changed when he told them at different times. And then the thing may be more, on a practical level, there\u2019s the book of Abraham, which he\u2026 Right. \u2026had said that he translated\u2026 Translated. \u2026from some Egyptian papyri that were found inside a mummy. And then later, you know, several generations later, when scholars could, could really translate hieroglyphs, they said that these were funeral documents and not a lost book of Abraham. So I want to ask, you know, as a very faithful member of the church and a scholar of the church, you know, how do you, how do you make sense of this kind of contradiction? I guess this is the side of me that \u2014 this is the stubborn side of me that is prone to say, \u2018Yeah, I have questions about the historicity in terms of how it came.\u2019 He didn\u2019t tell us how exactly this happened, how he got the information. I mean, you know, scholars even within the church have taken different views. One, one view is that he literally translated it from Egyptian. Another view, perhaps, is that the Egyptian papyri that he had proved as a kind of spiritual catalyst to receiving an independent revelation about the ancient figure of Abraham. I don\u2019t know what the answer is on that. And I, and I\u2019m as eager to learn about that as, as the critics of the church are just curious investigators of the church are. So you\u2019re, you\u2019re waiting for further revelation, in other words. Yeah, really, in that sense. And my attitude toward this is one of \u2014 I heard a church leader not long ago say this, which is very simple, but it has a profound implication for me. He said, \u201CFaith is just so much more than a feeling. Faith is a decision.\u201D And I think that\u2019s right for me. I made a decision a long time ago about Joseph Smith, fully aware now, maybe more so now as a professor for the last 25 years than I ever was as a young person, full aware that he was a human being, that he made mistakes. But I made a decision back then that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the work he set in motion was divinely inspired and that what I was about was good and that it would bless my life and bless other lives. And, and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m just sort of taking the stance of I, I just will not allow my faith to be held hostage by what the things I do know to be held hostage by what science has or has not discovered at a given moment in time. Does that make sense? That, to me is, it may sound na\u00EFve and it may sound weak, but, but that, that\u2019s the faith part of me saying, \u2018Well, of course I look forward to archeological evidences of the Book of Mormon. Of course, I look forward to substantiations of the translation of the Book of Abraham and so on. But I will, for the time being, put on the shelf the things I don\u2019t know because there are just too many things that I\u2019m, I\u2019m convinced of, and that the way of life that the church promotes highlights to me.\u2019 In other words, would I, would I want to go another way? I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m asked this all the time in my Evangelical-LDS dialogues: \u2018Have you ever given any thoughts to becoming Evangelical?\u2019 Well, I have great admiration for my Evangelical friends. I have tremendous feelings of appreciation for what they believe and why. But it\u2019s never crossed my mind to be other than Latter-day Saint. You know what? Let me put the question this way. I mean, if one reads accounts of Joseph Smith and \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a lot of turbulence and turmoil, which also had to do with the times in which he was living and\u2026 Right. \u2026and the path he chose and the turmoil and turbulence that that created. But even, you know, it seems to be \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of personal drama, you know? There is the, the development of polygamy within the tradition. There\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a chaotic picture that you get, especially, I think, if you just read it as historical details rather than through the lens of faith, you know? Yes, yes. If someone doesn\u2019t see Joseph Smith as a prophet, then you read it as, as a fairly chaotic story. Yes. But that picture, you know, could not stand in greater contrast to the picture that Mormons, Latter-day Saints \u2014 of the picture that people have of Mormon families, of Mormon communities, right? Of this, this community that you are describe in the beginning, this way of life. Well, I think that\u2019s right. And so I, you know, I guess I wonder is there something that happens in a religious experience \u2014 in this religious experience \u2014 where the lived religion somehow transcends this person of Joseph Smith, who, who gave rise to it? I don\u2019t think in the fully sense we can ever transcend Joseph Smith or consider him to be a valued personality, but now we\u2019ll move on. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that among believers in the faith, because there are too many other things that came from him that are the reasons why we do what we do and we are what we are. That there are unanswered questions, to be sure. That there are things that I\u2019m as anxious as the next guy to learn more detail on, I really want to know. But in the interim, it really doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t trouble me. We\u2019re in the religion-making business, as you intimated earlier, only for a short time, I mean, compared to the Christian church, which has been at this for a couple of millennia. We\u2019re about halfway to Nicaea. And so, and so in that sense \u2014 I remember a very tender moment. I was speaking with \u2014 I\u2019ve been invited to the Salt Lake Theological Seminary, basically an Evangelical seminary, to discuss a book I had done on Jesus. And they had read it, and they wanted me to come and just respond to questions. And it was, it was a very enjoyable couple of hours. The very last question that was asked by one of my friends there was this one. He said, \u2018Bob, what can we do for you?\u2019 And I, I wasn\u2019t ready for that question. I said, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 He said, \u2018What can we, as Evangelicals, do for our Mormon friends?\u2019 And I, I guess my mind could have gone a hundred different ways, but what I came back with was this. I said, \u2018Boy, I appreciate you asking that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been asked that.\u2019 But, but I said, \u2018Try this. Cut us a little slack, will you? Give us a little time. We\u2019re in the religion-making business, and this takes time. It takes centuries. And, and trying to explain the faith and articulate the faith, that doesn\u2019t come over night. We\u2019ve really only been about that for 20 or 30 years.\u2019 If you were just asked, \u2018Talk about the spiritual core of what it means to you to be part of the Latter-day Saints.\u2019 I mean, what, what are the concurs of your spiritual life as a practicing Mormon? What is, what the really important lived elements of your lived faith? Well, I think, I think the things that matter to me the most after I move beyond, and you never move beyond, but after I sort of move beyond the central core which is Christ and Him crucified, once I get beyond that and begin to talk about the more peripheral areas of my life, I\u2019d begin to say it matters to me a great deal to have some feel for where I came from and for why I am here and where I\u2019m going after this life. It matters very much for me as I associate not only now with my children, but now with my grandchildren, that I have a concept of family that spans the veil of death and that, and that I really intend to see them again one day and to be with them again one day and that the stuff I have believed in since I was 8 years old has very practical meaning to me in terms of how I live my life now and how I hope to live my life in a world to come. It dictates to me not only how I respect and admire and treat my wife, but it dictates to me how I treat the woman or the man on the street. I feel like I have a sense of responsibility to be as, as gentle and kind and, in my case, Christian as possible. It\u2019s, to me, if you\u2019re, if you want to talk about Christianity or what it stands for, you have to look carefully at what it produces in people. My religion, for me, not only sets forth my theology, but it sets forth my practical, daily living in terms of how I treat other people and how I come to love them. And whether they feel the same way about ultimate and eternal things that I do or not. Robert Millet is Professor of Ancient Scriptures and the Richard L.
