  "fullText": "The church Nadia Bolz-Weber founded is called the House for All Sinners and Saints. At six feet tall with spiky hair and a body covered in tattoos, she is an original voice in a loosely defined movement called the emerging church. Across generations, theologies and social passions, these are people reimagining Christianity. Nadia Bolz-Weber was raised in the conservative Church of Christ. She spent years as an addict and a stand-up comic before being surprised by what felt like a call to be a minister to people on the underside of life. She created the House for All Sinners and Saints with eight people in her living room in Denver. These days, convicted felons and elected officials join teenagers with pink hair at this church and others like it \u2014 redefining what church is \u2014 and with a deep reverence for tradition. I really feel strongly that you have to be deeply rooted in tradition in order to innovate with integrity. So, for example, we celebrate the Easter vigil, where you start with a new fire and you light it and you have this paschal candle and you parade in chanting, and we have these baptisms and we have the Eucharist and it\u2019s like amazing. And then we end it. When it\u2019s done, we have a huge dance party, and we feel like nothing says he is risen like a chocolate fountain in the baptismal font, right? So we are taking these traditions and we\u2019re living them out and then we\u2019re tweaking them in ways that are super meaningful or funny or relevant for us. So it\u2019s always both for us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Nadia Bolz-Weber is the author of a spiritual memoir called Pastrix. I interviewed her at the 2013 Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina, a gathering of the emerging church. We spoke in an outdoor tent before hundreds of her fans on a vast campsite on a stormy day. OK, so this is the only live event I\u2019ve ever done where I think I might have mud on my toes. If I do, forgive me. I\u2019m thrilled to be here with Nadia Bolz-Weber, who I \u2014 people ask how we find the voices for the show and a lot of what happens is I become aware of someone and they get on the list and then I start following them. So I\u2019ve been following you for a long time. Oh, that\u2019s creepy. I peek in your window. (laughs) No, so when we got invited here and I saw that you were on the schedule, I said, well, this is it, this is the time. So you were raised Church of Christ and how you described it as it mostly meant being good at not doing certain things. Yeah, right. Like not smoking, not drinking, not dancing, not mixed bathing, which sadly is not as kinky as it sounds. It just means boys and girls in the same swimming pool. That was not allowed. No musical instruments in church. Yeah. Yeah, the Church of Christ has that: no musical instruments in church. I remember that. Which is actually, to tell you the truth, one of the really beautiful things about the tradition. I serve what might be the only a cappella Lutheran church in the country. So even though I have a Lutheran congregation, that\u2019s the piece of my heritage that I imported into my church plant. That is really interesting. Um-hum. It\u2019s like sitting in the middle of a 140-person choir. They all sing in a cappella four-part harmony. It\u2019s beautiful. So, you know, I could not say the very first word of your book on public radio (laughs). I\u2019m not going to say it here either. Here\u2019s a sentence I can just get away with: \u201CThe mystery of the universe (the same universe that sometimes still makes me wonder what the hell I\u2019m doing and that maybe this really a is fairytale), close, was created by God.\u201D I wonder with all the distance you\u2019ve traveled in your life, also away from that origin, that place you started, is that a sense that this was created by God, this sense of mystery? Is that something that was with you early on? Yeah, it\u2019s funny. I never \u2014 with everything that happened and all of the stops along the way, I never really managed to be an atheist. I couldn\u2019t pull it off. I think the fact that there is a God is something that never left me no matter where I sojourned to. And so that particular piece I\u2019ve never struggled with, I think. But I have struggled with what that God looks like. You know, I was told that God was a man, for instance. So I think that there\u2019s this really insipid message to girls when you use the exclusive male pronoun for God, which is that God is male, but you\u2019re not. But you know what, Jimmy is. So whenever you sort of attribute a human characteristic to God that some people have and some people don\u2019t, it becomes problematic. And I\u2019m not opposed to them. I do use male pronouns for God. I\u2019m not opposed to that, but it\u2019s like saying, dear redheaded God, we just (laughs), we just praise you for being a redheaded God. And that\u2019s great for the redheads, you know? So, you know, when I was getting ready, preparing to interview you, there are a lot of interviews out there where people ask you \u2014 I mean, I believe you have the entire liturgical year tattooed on one of your arms \u2026 Correct. And there are a lot of interviews where people ask you about those tattoos, and that as a way into your theology now. I wonder how the other tattoos tell the story. You know, you don\u2019t have to tell us about all of them, but a little bit of the story of your life up to then through your tattoos. Yeah, for sure. When I was 17, I grew really fast, like, I even have stretch marks on my back because I grew so fast. I\u2019m 6\u20191\u2033. And for a while, I would try and slouch. And if you know me, I\u2019m not a sloucher, right? And that\u2019s because my family told me to be proud of my height and so \u2014 but it was a struggle for me for a while. And I was at \u2014 my father is a military officer and I was at some kind of military banquet and slumping over. The man next to him said, \u201CYour daughter is really tall and beautiful.\u201D And my father said, \u201CThanks. She\u2019s a little self-conscious about it.\u201D And he goes, \u201CWell, she\u2019s just a long-stemmed rose.\u201D So, I know, when I was 17, I got my first tattoo, which was a long-stemmed rose. But I had a boyfriend at the time who had tattoos, really beautiful tattoos, and so it was 1986 the first time I got tattooed. So to be a teenage girl getting tattooed in 1986 was not a common thing. I was like a little \u2014 thought I was like a little outlaw. I had no idea at that point that, if I hung out long enough, I would just be mainstream. Which might have disappointed you \u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s like now in places I hang out in Denver, I just look like a soccer mom. Yeah, right. So, and I have a cover-up on my back. I do have a tattoo that some junkie gave me when I was laying in his living room that\u2019s just gross and it\u2019s basically scar tissue that I carried around in many ways on my back. And it\u2019s in the process of being covered up right now with a huge image of the annunciation of Mary finding out that she\u2019s pregnant with Jesus. So it was time. So that was from those years where you did everything that the Church of Christ had told you not to do. That was like two years ago. No, it wasn\u2019t. OK. So you are now demonstrating the fact that you spent time as a stand-up comic. Yeah \u2026 And you said in the book that you got less funny as you got more healthy, but you\u2019re still pretty funny. Aw, thanks, yeah. I actually have no idea how people manage to be preachers without being stand-up comics first. I mean, that\u2019s the path I took and I just don\u2019t \u2014 it worked for me because, actually, comics see the reality from the underside, right? It\u2019s like Dickinson. You know, \u201CTell the truth, but tell it slant.\u201D So I think that comics do that. They come to the truth from a different angle than most people, but people can still recognize that it\u2019s the truth. And I think a good preacher does the same thing. But those years that you were a stand-up comic were also years of \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you felt despairing at the time, but, I mean, those were years of addiction and when you were getting things etched on your back by junkies. And I feel a theme running through your story of \u2014 you use the word \u201Cthe underside,\u201D right? Seeing the underside and seeing God at the same time. And that \u201Cand\u201D is really important. It\u2019s not a \u201Cbut,\u201D it\u2019s an \u201Cand.\u201D Right, correct. You also really emphasize the Christian themes of death and resurrection. And I\u2019d like you to talk about really what those words mean for you. Yeah. I mean, I feel like the Christian life is a life of continual death and resurrection. Also, I think some sectors of Christianity think, well, you\u2019re saved and then you\u2019re good, right? And then you just lead a really nice life and you\u2019re a good person and you\u2019re redeemed and you sort of climbed this spiritual ladder so that you\u2019re close to God. And that\u2019s just not been my experience. My experience is of that disruption, over and over again, of going along and tripping upon something that I think I know or that I think I\u2019m certain about, and realizing I\u2019m wrong. Or maybe fighting to think I\u2019m right about something over and over and over again until I experience what I call the sort of divine heart transplant. You know, it\u2019s like God reaches in and, the prophets speak of this. It\u2019s not a polite experience, you know? Well, tell \u2014 give me an example. Can you think of \u2026 Oh, gosh. OK. So when my church was mostly young adults, and it was sort of, you know, hip, urban young adults. And then I preached at Red Rocks Easter Sunrise services \u2014 10,000 people. And The Denver Post ran a front-page, full-page picture and story about me on preaching at Easter, and about my church and whatnot. And we only had about 40, 45 people every week at this point. And the next week, we doubled in size like overnight. And we were excited because we were really struggling to grow, but what happened was it was like the wrong kind of people. I mean, it was the wrong kind of different for us, right? Like some churches might freak out if the drag queens show up, but these were like bankers wearing Dockers, right? And we were like \u2026 It was not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like \u2014 I freaked out. This actually isn\u2019t a joke. I freaked out. And I kind of went on this little rampage about, like wait a minute. They could show up to any mainline Protestant church in the city and see a room full of people that looked just like them, right? And like, why are they coming \u2014 it was almost like, oh, well, this just so neat! Oh, this church is neat! They\u2019re so creative! You know, and I just thought you\u2019re ruining our thing, man; you are like messing it up. And at the same time, we got evicted, this whole story. We moved \u2026 Did they come with you? No, no. So we moved and then that was the first service with all the new people, right? And it was like this stately, historic neighborhood instead of the like grungy hipster neighborhood we came from. And I turned to this woman who\u2019s like my deacon, and I was like, \u201CWe got to get the hell out of this neighborhood because it\u2019s attracting the wrong element.\u201D Like this is \u2014 and I would call my friends and I\u2019d rant about it and what am I going to do, and I called one of my friends who has a similar type of church in St. Paul, Minnesota, called House of Mercy. And I called up Russell, and I was like, \u201CDude, have you ever had normal people take over your church?\u201D And so I go on this \u2014 I tell him the whole story expecting him to be like, man, that sucks, and instead he goes, because our community holds this value of welcoming the stranger, and he goes, \u201CYeah, you guys are really good at welcoming the stranger when its a young transgender kid, but sometimes the stranger looks like your mom and dad.\u201D I was like, you\u2019re supposed to be my friend! Click! You know, and so I had scheduled this meeting to talk about the demographic change in our community so that the people who are new \u2026 So just to be clear. So this to you felt like a bit of a death of the dream of what the church had been about. Yes, no, completely, because I thought, well, then the people who showed up will find out what the church is about and leave. And then what happened, thank God, is I had that phone call with Russell and had this like God reaching in and pulling out my heart of stone and replacing it with a heart of flesh, like something that was actually warm and beating again. And we had the meeting and I told that story and the people who were new told us who they were and why they were there so that the people who\u2019ve been there from the beginning could hear what the church is about. And then everyone went around in a circle and Asher said, \u201CLook, as the young transgender kid who was welcomed into this community, I just want to go on the record as saying I\u2019m glad there\u2019s people who look like my mom and dad here, because they love me in a way my mom and dad can\u2019t.\u201D Yeah, you\u2019re clapping, but like that sucked for me, like, I was sure I was right, I was going to fight the fight, I was going to do what needed to be done and then like my heart gets just cold and stony the longer I go on that path every time. So that to me, that\u2019s the Christian life. It\u2019s always death and resurrection. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I\u2019m outdoors at the Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina \u2014 today with Nadia Bolz-Weber of the House for All Sinners and Saints in Denver. So, I guess, I\u2019d love for you to just kind of walk us in to the House for All Saints and Sinners. I might start with this introduction from the Gay Denver blog. This may be\u2026 From the Gay Denver blog? Yeah. \u201CHouse for All Sinners and Saints. With a name like that, why wouldn\u2019t you try it? \u2026 They rocked a chocolate fountain in the baptismal font for Easter, they do a blessing of bikes, and they have something called Beer & Hymns. Amazing.\u201D Yeah, that\u2019s us. You like that? Yeah. It\u2019s this quirky blend of tradition and innovation. I actually have this \u2014 I really feel strongly that you have to be deeply rooted in tradition in order to innovate with integrity. So I feel like that congregation is an example of that. So, yeah, for example, we celebrate the Easter vigil. And this is an ancient liturgy in the church where you start with new fire and you light it and you have this paschal candle and you parade in chanting and \u2026 Do you go all night the night before? Well, no, but it\u2019s a good three, three-and-a-half-hour-long liturgy and it\u2019s at night. And then you chant the Exultate, which is an ancient chant about the Easter vigil. And we have baptisms and we do all these readings. We do this litany of the saints where we go outside and read the names of the dead and invite the dead to witness the resurrection, which is awesome because I\u2019ll chant like \u201CSt. Peter and St. Paul.\u201D And everyone says, \u201CCome celebrate with us.\u201D We have this book of dead that people write names in and I always forget to read them in advance because inevitably there\u2019ll be like \u201CMichael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett.\u201D And we come inside and like all of a sudden \u2014 well, you bang on the door first of all and it opens up and then all the lilies are out and the lights are on in the candles and we sing \u201CHallelujah\u201D for the first time since Lent started. And then we have a Euchar\u2026 We have these baptisms and we have a Eucharist and it\u2019s like amazing. And then we end it, when it\u2019s done, we have a huge dance party. I mean, huge. And we feel like nothing says he is risen like a chocolate fountain in the baptismal font, right? So we are taking these traditions and we\u2019re living them out and then we\u2019re tweaking them in ways that are super meaningful or funny or relevant for us. So it\u2019s always both for us. So did you know \u2014 this sense you have about innovation and tradition going hand in hand. I mean, I believe that for you \u2014 and this is true for me too. I grew up Southern Baptist \u2014 that liturgy when you discovered it later in life was a discovery. It was not something that you had been exposed to. So, I mean, just tell me how this developed in you, this love of tradition. How did that come to you? Well, I love that it has its own integrity and it doesn\u2019t demand mine in order to be meaningful, right? And I love \u2026 Did you start to discover it in seminary? No, it\u2019s when I was dating my husband, so I was not Christian when we met, even though, you know, I was raised Christian, but I left for 10 years and I was decidedly not Christian. And we met playing volleyball, which is like the sacred breeding grounds of tall people \u2026 And he was, like, this really cute Lutheran seminary student. He introduced me to a whole different form of Christianity I didn\u2019t know existed. Liturgy, people who actually care about the poor, you know, all this stuff that I didn\u2019t experience at all in my background. And I just slowly fell in love with it and, yeah, I love the integrity of the liturgy. I think that\u2019s the thing I go back to and I feel like me and my fellows are sort of more comforted by mystery than we are by certainty and so there\u2019s this mystery you get to enter into in the liturgy and in the Eucharist that we find very comforting to go back to again and again. Yeah, I have to say, when I started hearing about you and when I saw your picture, I wasn\u2019t surprised that you were a Christian minister. I was surprised that you were Lutheran. Yeah. And so I started digging around. I said I have to figure this out and, of course, it was a love story. It\u2019s a love story. It is a love story. I mean, becoming Lutheran for me, because being somebody who got clean and sober, it really felt like this rather rude interruption of my life by God, like I was really OK being dead by the time I was 30 and I had this tragic sense of who I was and God \u2014 it was like God plucked me off that path kicking and screaming and went, \u201CThat\u2019s cute. I\u2019m gonna put you over here \u2026\u201D And, so then I was all of a sudden on this completely other path that it didn\u2019t feel like I chose. And when I discovered Lutheran theology, one of the things I loved was that it felt like this beautiful, historical articulation of things that I\u2019d already experienced to be true in my life, like, I already experienced the fact that I was simultaneously sinner and saint. That\u2019s like a doctrine in Lutheran theology because I have this enormous capacity for destruction of myself and other people, and I have an enormous capacity for kindness as well. So I felt like someone was finally able to say, yeah, you\u2019re simultaneously both of these at all times. I loved the emphasis on grace, the fact that God always is coming to us. There\u2019s nothing we do to make our way to God. God is continually coming to us and interrupting our lives and wanting to be known. And I had experienced that to be true. And I was so grateful when I stumbled into a place where I didn\u2019t have to like remove half my brain in order to believe the things that they were telling me to believe. And it just felt true to me already. There\u2019s something that maybe seems counterintuitive about a church like this. I mean, I think \u201Cmodern\u201D would be too small a word to describe it. You know, \u201Cpost-modern\u201D as well. But there\u2019s something a little bit counterintuitive about a place, a community like yours, so valuing liturgy and tradition. But I sense \u2014 I mean, what you\u2019re saying is not only do they value liturgy and tradition, this kind of breadth of humanity gathering in one place, that liturgy and tradition becomes a bridge also where, as you say, you\u2019re not responsible for what they believe and yet there\u2019s something that happens. And they all get to enter into it and be a part of it. A huge difference between this congregation and most is the way we do liturgy. We\u2019re in the round, which is really important, because it democratizes the space. So the altar is quite literally and metaphorically at the center of our lives together as a community. And so being in the round, there\u2019s an accountability of presence, you can see each other, it facilitates the singing more, and it democratizes the space. If you go into most churches, really a third of the space is for the two special people who get to stand up front. So like if you walk in the door suspicious of institutions, suspicious of presumed authority, you already are turned off. You walk into the space and one-third of the space is for the two special people, you\u2019re like, why are you special, right? So I wear clerics, I wear clergy collar, but I sit among the community with everyone else. And then liturgy means the work of the people, and yet we\u2019ve relegated almost every part of the liturgy to the priest. It makes no sense. And so people walk in and they get to decide when they walk in if they want to do one of the jobs in the liturgy and they just grab that booklet. And so they can go, \u201COh, I\u2019m going to do the greeting\u201D or \u201CI\u2019m going to do the prayer of the day\u201D or \u201CI\u2019m going to say the Benediction or the post-Communion prayer or serve Communion.\u201D Nobody has to deem them worthy of it or good at it, and so the whole liturgy is led by within the community from the people who are there. I say the absolution, two out of the three Sundays I preach and I say most of the Eucharistic prayer, and other than that, nobody hears from me. We\u2019re anti-excellence, pro-participation is how we put it. We don\u2019t do anything really well, but we do it together. There\u2019s another way you said it. You said that you\u2019re super participatory, but High Church. Yeah, yeah. I call it informal High Church/tent revival. Yeah. You talked about how when you were first getting piercings and tattoos, it wasn\u2019t all the rage. Soccer moms didn\u2019t have them. We didn\u2019t have soccer moms then either. I have a daughter who has some piercings. And when I\u2019ve gone with her to do that, to me the piercing parlors, they have this real sacramental feel to them. Yes. Absolutely. I just wanted to ask you about that. Yeah, yeah. Well, I think that to sort of willingly go and modify your body is almost always attached to a deeply meaningful story for people. Not always, but quite often. And so I think it\u2019s a place where you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m going to submit to another human being who is going to do something that\u2019s going to modify my actual body. And so there\u2019s an element of trust to it that can feel sacred in a sense, sometimes scary. And I think that there\u2019s a \u2014 I mean, if we believe that Christianity is incarnational, it\u2019s important to pay attention to human bodies. And human bodies carry stories and some of us choose to carry those on the outside and not just on the inside. And I think that\u2019s what you see in a lot of tattooing and piercing. Yeah, and the people who are doing the tattooing and piercing, I\u2019ve experienced them. It feels like they carry this as a sacred trust. Absolutely. So do you think about what this rise in tattooing and piercing and body work says about this age we\u2019re in? Is there anything bigger going on? Well, I think we\u2019re used to personalizing everything. This is a generation that grew up with choose your own adventure stories. They got to choose how a book ended, they got to personalize their home page, they personalize their Facebook, they personalize everything. And so I think it\u2019s the personalization of the body in a sense as well. It\u2019s like you used to just doodle on the outside of your Trapper Keeper, you know, and now we doodle on the outside, so I think there\u2019s a personalization of the body as well because we\u2019re just used to that. > Go to our website, onbeing.org, to listen and see my entire live conversation with Nadia Bolz-Weber. She is a strikingly charismatic figure in the flesh. Coming up, Mary Magdalene as the patron saint of showing up. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with Nadia Bolz-Weber. She is the founder and pastor of the House for All Sinners and Saints in Denver. I spoke with her at the Wild Goose Festival, a gathering of a loose movement sometimes called the emerging church, which is reimagining the face and voice of Christianity in an evolving world. Nadia Bolz-Weber\u2019s path to being a Lutheran minister wove through addiction and recovery and a few years as a stand-up comic. She\u2019s six feet tall, spiky-haired, and covered in tattoos. And her captivating spiritual memoir is called Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner and Saint. So one thing I really like that you name and elaborate on in your book is a real reality check about churches, even your church, as a place that is going to disappoint people, where people will get hurt, because it\u2019s full of human beings. And we know that these things happen and they take us by surprise and they\u2019re so devastating because it\u2019s church. You\u2019re very clear that this community will disappoint people. \u201CIt\u2019s a matter of when, not if. We will let them down or I\u2019ll say something stupid and hurt their feelings.\u201D And experience has proved that this is true, yes. (laughs) Yeah, I just I\u2019m not idealistic about any kind of human project. I try and always keep that in check. I\u2019m completely idealistic about God\u2019s ability to redeem our stuff and our mistakes, but I think if we aren\u2019t open about the fact that we\u2019ve made them, that can be a barrier to experiencing that forgiveness and that redemption and that grace. So I think in a way what might sound sort of cynical about, don\u2019t trust us, don\u2019t be idealistic about this community or about me, to me that just opens a door for grace in a sense. Because what I say to people, I mean, I literally say that as our welcome to house brunches \u2014 like, I\u2019m glad you love it here, but like at some point, I will disappoint you or the church will let you down. Please decide on this side of that happening if, after it happens, you will still stick around. Because if you leave, you will miss the way that God\u2019s grace comes in and fills in the cracks of our brokenness. And it\u2019s too beautiful to miss. Don\u2019t miss it. Have you had experiences, I mean, what that looks like three-dimensionally \u2014 how that plays out \u2014 that you could talk about? Yeah, absolutely. I don\u2019t want to talk about specifics because I don\u2019t have permission from the people in the parish, but I can say that they are not unfamiliar with me apologizing for being wrong. And they have forgiven me many times for mistakes that I have made. And I\u2019m exceedingly grateful for that. Also, I will say that I think that the fact that I don\u2019t find it a threat to my authority to say that I\u2019ve made a bad call or that I\u2019ve made a mistake, I think that actually allows this population to let me have authority for them. If that makes sense. Because I feel like there\u2019s a lot of defending and protecting of authority that keeps us from apologizing when we\u2019re wrong or admitting that we made a mistake and people see that. Like here\u2019s the thing about admitting your mistakes: Other people see them, right? By pretending that we didn\u2019t like completely screw the pooch does not in any way keep other people from knowing that we made a huge mistake. So, if you\u2019re somebody who just has that transparency, people tend to just trust you more rather than resent you for making mistakes. But on a little bit of an angle at that, you talked this morning \u2014 and I know it was helpful for people \u2014 about being humble, also not always being apologizing. So it\u2019s a different, I mean, you\u2019re talking about actually apologizing for actual concrete mistakes. Correct, not for your \u2014 who you are. But, then there\u2019s this line to walk, which can be especially tricky for women to walk. Correct, yeah, I don\u2019t apologize for who I am. I am not self-apologetic. I always try to apologize for mistakes I\u2019ve made. And I try not to think of everything that happens in the world as a mistake I\u2019ve made as well. Like that could be a trip-up as well, right? So I think there is that sweet spot, because I think sometimes women especially, if they\u2019re in positions of power or authority, feel like they can\u2019t afford to apologize for their mistakes, because it\u2019s too close to apologizing for who they are, and I think that\u2019s a misstep. Or, as you say, they apologize for everything and take everything on, and then you give your authority away. Yeah, which is just annoying. Don\u2019t do that. Yeah, yeah, I\u2019d like to come back to the underside, the pain and suffering and despair that\u2019s out there. You talked about the sense of being picked up by the scruff of your neck. But everybody doesn\u2019t get carried away from addiction, from being suicidal, from mental illness, and those were all things that you saw up close in people you loved for a number of years. How do you work with that theologically? Well, I think that we\u2019ve sort of glamorized certain types of brokenness. You know, there\u2019s like the big ones: mental illness, addiction. And in a way, it can be very tempting to allow those people who are so obviously broken to just carry all of the brokenness for us. And I think that\u2019s not honest, because I just have never met a human being who has not experienced some kind of suffering, some kind of brokenness. Maybe it has to do with divorce, something that feels so common we\u2019re not allowed to, like, really consider it to be brokenness anymore. Or maybe it has to do with body image. Or maybe \u2026 Everybody has something that they \u2014 like it might not be a huge addiction, the really kind of big sexy ones, but it might be there\u2019s something that we feel powerless over, that we feel like has a hold of us, that we don\u2019t feel like we have much choice in, like we\u2019ve lost the ability to choose whether we\u2019re going to do this, or think this, or be in this relationship, and then our life has a certain element of unmanageability because of that. I think that is very, very, very common, even if you don\u2019t have one of the big sexy problems that we sort of identify. So, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s just the human condition, that you have those dark places \u2026 Absolutely. Whether you\u2019re \u2026 I mean, maybe some people don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t find them very interesting. You know, maybe some people are just perfectly fine, but I don\u2019t want to have coffee with them. But so again, you know, the theology question. I mean, how do you make sense of God in light of that? It\u2019s the theodicy question I guess. Yeah, it is. Well, I think that really always comes down to my particular Christology, my idea of Jesus, because I think a lot of people, when there\u2019s suffering, when there\u2019s tragedy, they say, well, where is God in the midst of this? Most of God is unknowable, and we should probably be grateful for that \u2014 it\u2019s in that like I want to know, right? But so if you look at Jesus, to me the greatest revelation of who God was was actually at the cross. Because to me that\u2019s not God\u2019s little boy, like God is some sort of divine child abuser sending his son \u2014 and he only had one, you know \u2014 like, come on, give me a break, right? You know, God\u2019s little boy and he only had one, and as this sort of divine child abuser, or as this cigar-chomping loan shark demanding his pound of flesh, you know, he\u2019s sending his little boy to the \u2014 what hogwash, right? That actually is God on the cross, that\u2019s God saying, I would rather die than be in the sin-accounting business that you\u2019ve put me in. That from the cross, you know, there\u2019s all this stuff about the final judgment. You know what the final judgment is to me? It\u2019s God dying on the cross and saying: forgive them; they know not what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s an eternally valid statement to me. That is God\u2019s judgment upon us. And so, to me, if God could bear that kind of suffering and only respond in forgiveness and love, that\u2019s the God who is present in a devastating hurricane, in that room with an abused child. So to me, God has come into the world and is bearing that, not causing it. I\u2019m going to do one other question and then I\u2019d like to open the conversation up to the people in the room. Mary Magdalene, who you\u2019ve called the patron saint of showing up. Well, first of all, tell us about your Mary Magdalene tattoo. And then tell us what Mary Magdalene means to you. I do have a tattoo of Mary Magdalene. It\u2019s from a 12th-century psalter in the British Isles, the St. Albans Psalter. And this is only part of the depiction, the other part. So she\u2019s standing there with a finger up in the air kind of going shut the hell up and listen to me for a minute. And then over here in the part that I didn\u2019t have room on my arm to show \u2026 She\u2019s not apologizing for herself. She\u2019s clearly not apologizing for herself, A., and then, over in this part of the depiction are all the apostles huddled with befuddled looks on their faces, like pointing at scrolls, very confused. And so, she is announcing the resurrection. She was the one, this woman who was delivered from so much, who was broken and could do nothing but follow Jesus and provide for Jesus and care for Jesus, and show up. She didn\u2019t hightail it out when things got hot. She showed up. And she was the one who was chosen to be the first witness of the resurrection. She was the one who was told to go and tell. I don\u2019t know what other authority I need than that story to be a preacher. So I very much love Mary Magdalene, yes. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I\u2019m outdoors at the Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina \u2014 today with Nadia Bolz-Weber of the House for All Sinners and Saints in Denver. Wild Goose is a Celtic-Christian metaphor for the unpredictable spirit of God, and this is a multigenerational gathering around music, justice, spirit, and art. I think there are some microphones, uh, somewhere. We have one right here. I\u2019m just going to go around. OK. I\u2019m curious about your kids. I\u2019m the mom of double PKs and I\u2019m often asked \u2014 and they\u2019re now all out of the house and people ask me questions about how did that all work. So can you just say something about how your ministry has enhanced your parenting? You\u2019ll notice in the book I almost never talk about my children, which is very intentional. My editor tried to get me to write about my kids, and I\u2019m like, this is not the life they chose. They didn\u2019t choose for their mom to be a public figure. So I really try to protect their privacy as much as I can. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, you know, Angelina Jolie, clearly, but, you know, but I do try and protect that. I can say that they\u2019ve always been part of community, which is something I hope has really formed who they are. We are not the kind of family that does a lot of like family devotionals. We don\u2019t pray together as a family. We don\u2019t do this faith stuff in our home. You know why? My kids are around it all the time, and so I just feel like they need a break at home, you know. So like we \u2014 I know it\u2019s like a big deal to like build faith in the home and do all that stuff. We don\u2019t do that. There was a question. You\u2019re in a liturgical church, very structural, that sort of stuff, but you\u2019re a planter and you\u2019re doing your own thing. What was your experience being under authority? You have authority to speak, but what\u2019s your experience having to place yourself under authority? Yes, because I have a bishop. So here\u2019s what I have to say about that. Somebody like me should have a bishop. That is \u2014 I am why we have bishops. And I only say that half joking because, you know, I wrote a book. It was not an important piece of work. It was in 2008, called Salvation on the Small Screen? \u2014 where I watched 24 consecutive hours of Trinity Broadcasting Network. So my friends signed up for an hour each to watch with me. It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s not whatever. But what I realized was I was watching these TV preachers and I asked myself the question, like did they at the beginning of their ministry love the Gospel? Like did they have this intention to really spread this beautiful good news? And if so, what were all the steps it took to become what they are now? And like, you know what they don\u2019t have? Bishops. They don\u2019t have people looking over their shoulder to say, \u201CAre you still on the Yellow Brick Road?\u201D Do you know what I mean? And so like you know what? I have been able to get other people to do things my entire life, and that can be a good thing and that can be a dangerous thing. And so I need somebody to be watching to make sure I\u2019m still on the Yellow Brick Road. So for that reason, I am grateful that there are bishops. Nadia, it\u2019s great to hear from you directly. My friend and I drove down from Indiana. I drug my son along just for this occasion. I am a Lutheran pastor, ordained 14 years, and I wanted to thank you, because your boldness has inspired more boldness for me. But I so appreciated your recent sermon/blog post on why you named your depression. I can\u2019t remember the name now. Frances. Yes, Frances. Yes. My husband was hospitalized at the time that that came out, and it\u2019s a real struggle in Lutheran circles, as I\u2019m sure it is in other denominations, to be up front about mental illness. What has been your experience of that and any advice for those of us in the trenches? Well, I \u2026 Why did you name your depression Frances? I named my depression Frances because it was like a really bad roommate who would never leave. And at the time when I really suffered from depression, it was when Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love had their child named Frances Bean, and so I named my \u2014 at the time they named their child, I named my depression Frances. But I always pictured her more like Courtney Love, kind of emaciated in a vintage nightgown with like smeared lipstick and a gin bottle and a cigarette. Like that was Courtney. I mean, that was Frances, my depression. And like at first, she was kind of interesting to hang out with, but then she just never moved out. And I have this thing about being a preacher who reveals things about herself, and it\u2019s that I always try to preach from my scars and not my wounds. So, talking about depression is not in any way a wound for me. I don\u2019t suffer from it nearly as much, thank God, because I just take Wellbutrin every day, but, um, yeah, a big fan. But I think that, as a preacher, it\u2019s good to tell the truth about yourself, and it\u2019s a hard line to tow. I mean, it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s hard to hold the office of word and sacrament if you\u2019re struggling too much with your own personal stuff. That\u2019s just hard. And it\u2019s all about holding that office to me. How many members of the church are there? Well, we don\u2019t have membership, so, you know, in the Lutheran church, somebody is a member if they show up once and commune once and give money once. So we have thousands of members, if that\u2019s the case right, because approximately all of the people visit the church, right? But I would say active people, there\u2019s probably 200 or 250, something like that. And it started with eight people in my living room five years ago. And it\u2019s such a freak show. I mean, not in the fact that \u2014 you know that story about I was worried because the normal people were coming to my church? OK, the thing is, is literally you walk in now and you will see a convicted felon serving communion to a statewide elected official next to a teenager with pink hair holding the baby of a soccer mom from the suburbs. And I thought the weirdness of my congregation was going to be diluted, right? It is only weirder now. You walk in, you go, \u201CI am unclear what all these people have in common.\u201D So a sermon of yours I wish I could have heard is \u201CLoving Our Enemies Even If We Don\u2019t Mean It.\u201D Yeah, I think meaning it is overrated. I mean, I think \u2026 I think this is profound. I really do. No, I\u2019m serious. Like, my gosh, if God\u2019s going to wait till I mean it, that\u2019s going to be a while, right? So I think that the key is praying for them, not like feeling warm feelings towards people who\u2019ve hurt you or towards your enemy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about feelings. I think it\u2019s about an action. And I think that action is commending them to the one who perfected the love of the enemy. That\u2019s prayer, right? And that is what we \u2014 I think that\u2019s what the sort of love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you means. I will actually ask other people to do it for me sometimes, like it doesn\u2019t always have to be us. And so it\u2019s like this thing like I don\u2019t think faith is given in sufficient quantity to individuals necessarily. I think it\u2019s given in sufficient quantity to communities. The same with that whole thing like God will not give you more than you can bear. I don\u2019t think God will give you more than a community can bear. And we\u2019ve individualized this thing of faith so much \u2026 In a way that makes it inaccessible to people because they\u2019re like, well, I don\u2019t know if I believe this. Like the Apostles\u2019 Creed. I can\u2019t say the Creed because I don\u2019t know if I believe every line in the Creed. I\u2019m like, oh, my God. Nobody believes every line of the Creed. But in a room of people for each line of the Creed, somebody believes it. So we\u2019re covered, right? So this is Western individualism run amok in religion. It\u2019s not your creed. It\u2019s the church\u2019s creed and I think we\u2019ve really lost track of that in this like personal me and Jesus, how I feel, what my piety is, my personal prayer life, all of that stuff, and we\u2019ve lost the beauty of \u2014 this thing is really about community. It always has been the body of Christ. You mentioned your parents and to me there\u2019s an image in the relationship that you have with your parents and by extension with that tradition that you grew up in, which you left and rejected in some senses. That they embrace you, at a certain angle to their beliefs, right? Yeah. Um, and that you learn about God, you know not necessarily through what people believe about God or not what they say about God, but by how they are to you. And it seems to me that your parents\u2019 love for you, and how they\u2019ve reacted to you all along the way, is such a picture of that. Yeah. My parents are really extraordinary people and they love me fiercely. And I haven\u2019t always been the easiest person to love. And I felt really called to start a church for my people, in a sense, and I had to tell my parents that I was going to be a pastor. And I was scared because I thought I didn\u2019t want them to beat me with the scripture stick. I didn\u2019t want them to shame me. And then I felt horrible that my parents still could shame me and I was in my late 30s. And so I told them the whole story, and my dad gets up and he grabs his Bible, and I thought, oh, no. But he turned to the Book of Esther, and all he read \u2014 it was this point where she knew that she was supposed to do this thing and she was scared and didn\u2019t want to do it, and she was talking to her uncle. And my father read this: \u201CBut you were born for such a day as this.\u201D And then he closed the Bible \u2014 and I still tear up thinking about this. And my parents embraced me and they gave me a blessing and they prayed over me. And like it\u2019s very scriptural that you need a blessing to go and do what you\u2019re going to do and to be who God\u2019s called you to be. And the fact that my blessing got to come from my Church of Christ parents is one of the most profound gifts in my lifetime. And so if people feel that God has called them to something and you have trepidation, you need to get a blessing from someone. And if it can\u2019t be your parents, find somebody else, because I cannot tell you how that released me and freed me to go and do the work I did. And I feel like it\u2019s this thing in the Bible that we\u2019ve forgotten about. And for me, it ended up being really critical and profound to go with a blessing. Thank you, Nadia Bolz-Weber.
