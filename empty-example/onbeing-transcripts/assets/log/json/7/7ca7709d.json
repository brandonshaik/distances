  "fullText": "Bernard Chazelle is a Princeton computer scientist and a lover of the music of Bach. He\u2019s written, \u201CBach didn\u2019t regard himself as an artist but as a scientist, a cosmologist of music.\u201D And after hearing this conversation, you may never listen to any piece of music \u2014 whether Bach or Jay-Z \u2014 in quite the same way again. What I find very strange is this. I mean, all Bach is doing is sending a bunch of sound waves. So in your brain, there must be this reservoir of beauty which most often is untapped. But if you can find it with the right spotlight, then you discover this amazing consonances, or dissonances, or this amazing narrative, story, inside you\u2026There is this enormous gold mine that can be revealed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. My conversation with Bernard Chazelle was part of Bachstock \u2014 WQXR New York\u2019s month-long festival celebrating the music, life, and times of Bach. We spoke before a live audience at the Jerome L. Greene Performance Space in Lower Manhattan. Hello. Good evening. It\u2019s so great to be here in the Green Space. And I\u2019ll just want to start by introducing Bernard Chazelle, who is Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, with a specialty in computational geometry. He works with algorithms, a field he believes to hold promise of a scientific revolution. A key theme of his blog is also his love of music. He writes in a most original way about Eric Clapton, and Eminem, and Thelonious Monk, and Amy Winehouse, and Bob Dylan, and especially Johann Sebastian Bach. Bernard Chazelle makes observations like this: \u201CMillions of years of evolution have turned our ears into a giant logarithmic table.\u201D He also says things like, \u201CBach, the most human of all composers, gets to your soul through your body,\u201D or this, \u201CBach, like Ellington, doesn\u2019t do despair.\u201D So, I think if we get to the end of this conversation with the capacity to hear Bach, in some way, as you do, then our musical lives will be that much more adventurous. So, thank you so much for joining me tonight. Well, thank you having me. Yeah. So, I\u2019m curious about the earliest roots of your passion for both computer science and music. I wonder just to start, was there a religious background to your childhood? And was Bach in that religious background? OK. I grew up in Paris, in France. So I came from a family where the religion came from my mother. Very religious. And my grandfather, her father, was a church organist. Mm-hmm. And, my household had no music, basically. And I had a passion for music. But, my grandfather gave me a whole stack of Bach\u2019s mostly organ music in 78 rpm, which tells you how young I am. And so very early on, I listened to that. It was probably my first exposure to music. But I\u2019ve always had this strange feeling that when I listen to Bach, he\u2019s the only composer who I think really has written this music for me. Because it speaks to me in a way no other music does. Mm-hmm. So. And you write a lot about your pleasure in music, an overwhelming pleasure, and particularly in Bach. And I almost feel like, for you, pleasure in music is kind of a compass. It\u2019s a true thing. Almost as true as numbers. Yes. It\u2019s hard to explain, because I work in mathematics mostly, and I have great admiration for all kinds of mathematicians, like the true geniuses of history. And even though I can only in my dream aspire to do that kind of work, I understand what it is. But Bach, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s the thing. In other words, it\u2019s not just that I\u2019m not gifted enough or something, it\u2019s another dimension. It\u2019s like if I met somebody from a different planet\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026and it\u2019s a paradox, because I think Bach is the most human of composers. So obviously, there\u2019s a contradiction there. How can he be both the most human, and be completely out of this world? Well, let me ask you this. I\u2019ve always been so intrigued by this mysterious connection between mathematics and music. Music and numbers. And, I\u2019ve asked people to explain it to me across the years, and I kind of just grasp it around the edges. You\u2019ve talked about computer science as a profound window through which to view the world. You add the notion of algorithm to mathematics. And I wonder, is your life as a computer scientist also a window onto music or onto Bach? Or are these two things just kind of in conversation an interplay on your life? Yeah, I think that\u2019s exactly the latter. They\u2019re in conversation. I mean, for example, because I\u2019m naturally interested by mathematics, and, well, that\u2019s what I do for a living, but I like to analyze Bach, because it\u2019s complicated music. And there\u2019s a whole logical system which I like naturally because that\u2019s who I am. Right. It\u2019s not necessary at all. It\u2019s just curiosity. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to my \u2014 in fact, I would say that the only way to understand Bach is to listen to him. And there\u2019s nothing else needed. There\u2019s absolutely no need to study anything about it. Just listen to the thing over and over again, and finally it will come. Now mathematics and music, yeah. I\u2019ve thought a lot about this. And of all the arts, music is the only one that is purely physical. Yeah. Maybe abstract art now is, but literature, a play, a poem, so to speak about music is very difficult, because we can speak like Macbeth, and there is a story there, we can talk about the story, and then we can try to go beyond it. There\u2019s a painting. Well, you can discuss what\u2019s going on on the canvas. But the \u201COde to Joy\u201D, if Beethoven didn\u2019t tell us it was about joy, it could be about hamburgers for all we know. I mean, it\u2019s just music. And yet, of course, music has a little fragments of language because if you play the western standard, you know, western standard music, has certain signifiers, like cadences, and dissonance, and there\u2019s certain things that indicate emotion. So you can create moods that will kind of appeal to certain mental dispositions, but it\u2019s very fragile. Ultimately, since music is so powerful and so physical, you ultimately have to go back to physics in ways you don\u2019t have to understand. You see, I was talking about evolution is giving us a logarithm table. Yes. You know\u2026 Yes, how evolution has turned our ears into a giant logarithm table. Yeah, well, that\u2019s what it is. So, yeah, what do you mean by that? Yeah. Because, what I mean by this\u2026 The way we process music. No, when we hear music, we hear, sound waves. So, air bounces around at a certain frequency. It could be very quick, could be very slow. And your brain takes the logarithm of this frequency, that\u2019s what it does. Nobody knows exactly how it does that. So logarithm is a function. But has all kinds of property, a mathematical thing that has all kinds of properties. And your brain automatically does that. It\u2019s not like you have to be trained. That\u2019s what your brain does. That\u2019s how it processes sounds. And so, once you\u2019ve done that, then there are relations between sounds, which we know sound good. This is universal to the human brain, why we like it. We can explain this, because it\u2019s the small fractions that was \u2014 the frequencies are in certain fractions. And so basic chord structure comes from physics. It\u2019s not a choice. Here\u2019s something that you wrote. \u201CIf Jay-Z\u2019s \u201CMy 1st Song\u201D rocks my world, it\u2019s because a bluesy F-sharp minor resonance physically rocks my auditory cortex.\u201D That\u2019s one way to put it. Not sure Jay-Z would put it that way. But\u2026 So, all right, so this idea that music is the most, um, physical art form. Yeah. And you have observed that it\u2019s the small fractions that make music the physical art form it is. Yeah. And, that no one is more amazing at small fractions than Bach. Yeah. So, let me try to unpack. Yeah. This. It\u2019s\u2026 Can I just say, interviewing you I feel is how I feel when I\u2019m interviewing a string theorist. Where I\u2019m just- Oh, no. Where I \u2014 no, where I\u2026 It\u2019s that bad. Kind of. Right, yeah. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll try harder. \u2026Where we don\u2019t all speak this language. So yes. Interpret. Translate. So, Bach. So the well-tempered clavier, which is this famous piece \u2014 a lot of music Bach wrote was intended as like homework assignments, like practice. They\u2019re not intended as concert pieces. And so, there are four of them in the key of C, and then four of them in the key of C sharp, and then four of them in the key of D. Why? Because he invented a new \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t invent it, but he played with a new kind of tuning the piano \u2014 which is called well-tempered. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s called well-tempered. In the case of Bach, it changes the actual personality of the key. And so when it\u2019s in B minor, or in D minor this has true meaning for him. It\u2019s not just, well I did it because the way you sing, it corresponds to your voice. No, no, no, no. On the piano, well, there\u2019s no singing there, but he did it because every key had its own particular flavor, mood if you will. And that is mastery of the highest order, when you think about it. I mean, especially if you think you\u2019re doing this not just for prosperity, for art, but simply as a textbook. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of devotion to students. That is mastery of the highest order, when you think about it. I mean, especially if you think you\u2019re doing this not just for prosperity, for art, but simply as a textbook. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of devotion to students. And\u2026 I mean, I know from experience. \u2026And I think \u2014 do you experience that as a kind of intuitive, mathematical sophistication? There\u2019s something he\u2019s intuiting, that you can explain in other terms. Yeah, so, what\u2019s remarkable about Bach more than any \u2014 OK, before I go into this, I don\u2019t want to forget to say one thing. OK. And maybe I\u2019ll come back to this. When your producer very kindly invited me to be on this show\u2026 Yes. \u2026I was very excited. And I said \u201Cyes\u201D immediately. I then checked my calendar and I would drop everything, because how can I resist talking about Bach? And, so, and then I told \u2014 I was so excited, I told my family, and my friends. And all of them, without exception, had the same reaction, which was, \u201CWhy you?\u201D Why did they choose you? And I could not answer. Because in fact, the level of scholarship today about Bach, I mean, has never been higher. I mean, in the city of New York alone, you could find half a dozen world experts who should be right now sitting in this chair. And, so, anyway, Now I forget what I was talking about. So\u2026 So, what I\u2019d\u2026 Oh yeah. No. \u2026it\u2019s because we have these special powers of investigation\u2026 The mathematics. Yes. Yes. The, yeah, if it\u2019s only mathematics, I can say something without embarrassing myself. But, I think it\u2019s fair to say, that western music got the most complex at the time of Bach. And then it got only simpler. It\u2019s only gotten simpler since. And so, let\u2019s try to unpack what I mean by this. Mm-hmm. You know, if you listen to classical music, so I\u2019m being a pedant here \u2014 classical music really means from Haydn, onto Bach is baroque. And Handel it\u2019s different. But classical music has greatly simplified Bach by developing the concept of having a tune, of having a voice, and harmony. So, most of Mozart, you know, there\u2019s a melody. A beautiful melody, because the guy was a genius. And then there\u2019s a gorgeous harmony with all kinds of interesting dynamics and so on. But there\u2019s a hierarchy. There is a voice telling you a story. And then there\u2019s the accompaniment to make it beautiful. Bach is not like that. There are the concept of voices. So Bach is going to have six voices, like the Goldberg variations which are six people having their own melodies. And the harmony is derived from that. So, it\u2019s a completely different way of composing music. It was so complicated that people said, \u201Ccome on, let\u2019s get rid of this thing. This is just too complicated. We\u2019ve got make it simpler.\u201D Yeah. And so, it\u2019s been simpler since. This is Bach\u2019s \u201CPartita No.2 in C Minor\u201D, as the pianist Anna Polonsky played it for us in the Greene Space when I interviewed computer scientist Bernard Chazelle. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. So tell me what you mean, when you\u2019ve written that Bach did not regard himself as an artist, but as a scientist, a cosmologist of music. Yeah, so, that also is an interesting story. So maybe we should briefly talk about in the 19th century, there was a major change. The concept of art was radically changed. And so, to understand this, let\u2019s take our time now. When Martin Scorsese has a new movie out, you hear that Martin Scorsese made a movie. A scientist does not make anything. An engineer does, but not a scientist. When you study astronomy, you don\u2019t make the constellations. You don\u2019t make the stars. You just try to understand what\u2019s there. And, Bach wouldn\u2019t have ever thought of himself as a maker of music. In fact, when he died, there\u2019s an obituary of a guy who really couldn\u2019t stand Bach. Bach made quite a few enemies in his life. And he wrote this really trenchant thing that says, in English, that Bach was a music maker. And that was considered the worst insult. And this is like, oh, I\u2019m not a music \u2014 he\u2019s a music discoverer. So, Bach viewed himself as a discoverer of music, not as a maker. There\u2019s that other analogy, mathematicians also talk about\u2026 Yeah. \u2026whether equations are invented or discovered. Yes. Yeah. That\u2019s a very good \u2014 in fact, so let\u2019s talk about mathematics. Let\u2019s talk about Newton. So, I think it\u2019s important to remember that all of these are pre-enlightenment dispositions. And Newton is a good example. So here\u2019s Newton, who invented the calculus. It\u2019s very important in science. And, with Leibniz but, he invented the calculus. And so, you can ask, why? Why did Newton invent the calculus? And he did because he wanted to do physics. And so you can ask, well, why did he want to do physics? Now, today, if you ask that question to a physicist, they\u2019ll say, well, because that\u2019s what I do. I like physics. I do physics because I like physics. Physics are important. And that\u2019ll be the end of the story. But that\u2019s not the way it worked. Newton did physics in order to do astronomy. Why did he did do astronomy? He did astronomy not because he was interested in the stars, because he wanted to date Biblical text and ancient classical text. Because he realized the Greeks got their astronomy wrong, they didn\u2019t know that the stars every year moved \u2014 the whole thing shifted by a tiny angle, every year. And so, when you use the stars to date, you ended up making big mistakes. Now there\u2019s some question as to the dating of Newton himself, but that was his motivation. And he became a big hero. By the time Bach was in function, Newton was considered all across Europe as the ultimate genius. Right. I mean, Newton equaled genius. Right. And he wanted to discover the laws of the universe. And he became very famous, very popular in Europe because he had a very happy explanation for a story which meant a lot to people, which is, in Virgil\u2019s \u2014 Aeneid there\u2019s this love story between Dido and Aeneas. And it\u2019s a beautiful love story. But there\u2019s only one problem with it which is that if you believe the mythology, Dido and Aeneas are 300 years apart. So it\u2019s pretty hard to have a love affair when you\u2019re 300\u2026 \u2026when one has been dead for 300 years. But Newton managed, with his new dating, he managed to say, no, no, no, no, actually, look. I can prove they actually lived at the same time. That made people so happy. Like, for hundreds of years, everybody said, oh, no, that love story is fake. It\u2019s fake. This is terrible. He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, it is true. He also re-dated the Trojan War \u2014 he re-dated everything. And, so he becomes very popular. And, Bach had a good friend Winckler, who was a physicist, and who actually was teaching Newton\u2019s ideas. Now, there\u2019s no evidence that Bach himself knew the physics of Newton. He was\u2026 Right. \u2026too busy doing other things. But he saw Newton, and here, this is not my theory, this is Christoph Wolff, who was a professor at Harvard, who is the master of that sort of thing. And, that Bach saw himself like Newton, not as the maker of a craft, but as a discoverer of the laws of the musical universe, of aesthetics. And so, for him, it was a way, you know, every piece he wrote, Bach, he signed as SDG, Soli Deo Gloria. You know, to the glory of God, alone. That\u2019s what it means. To the glory of God alone. The key word is alone. Because it\u2019s not to the glory of God and me, the composer. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s to the glory of God and nobody else. Because the whole point was that he was out to glorify God by showing \u2014 by discovering the relation between nature and God. That was his only goal. And if you don\u2019t understand that, you cannot understand why, for example, he had no interest in posterity. A concept we cannot comprehend. Right. Right. He had no interest, for example, that his cantatas, his passions survived. I mean, just think about it. You\u2019ve produced this masterpiece, and then you say, oh, it\u2019s OK, you can destroy it. That\u2019s fine. Because God will know, God will not forget that I did it, and that\u2019s good enough for me. It\u2019s so interesting for me in your writing that Bach never stopped fine-tuning the mass in B minor. That in fact, he never heard the B minor mass performed in full in his lifetime. Yes. So the mass in B minor is a special case. Yeah. Though it is true, he fine-tuned. Fine-tuning was the practice of the day. You would take other people\u2019s work\u2026 And I mean, just\u2026 \u2026and fine-tune\u2026 \u2026you know, just, again\u2026 \u2026them. \u2026to your point, in terms of how we work now, we are creating something and offering it to the world as perfect as it can be. Yes. And thinking about how it will survive. Yes. And that that was\u2026 No, for him\u2026 \u2026he had a completely\u2026 \u2026it was\u2026 \u2026different mindset. Yeah. And, which is why, also, like what we just heard this incredible, beautiful music \u2014 in German, this is part of something called clavier-\u00FCbung. And \u00FCbung means workout. Yeah. This is a workout. This was written to teach pupils in the next generation. The only thing he wanted posterity to keep were his textbooks. Because he thought that\u2019s very useful for the next generation to learn music. But, no concept of that beauty has to stay. And, now the mass in B minor is a special case, because he mostly recycled cantatas, and the mass in B minor is a very long thing. He never heard it in his lifetime. It\u2019s mostly made of pieces that are re-tooled from older cantatas, except for a few pieces, like the Gloria, the Kyrie, which he wrote just for this. And the reason he did this is because he was trying to get \u2014 basically a job, an approval \u2014 stamp of approval from the King of Poland. You know, if I\u2019m the official court composer of that king, because he was working for a bunch of idiots. Because there\u2019s a famous quote of one of these idiots, who said, when they hired Bach, they said, well, I guess the best players or the best musicians, we couldn\u2019t hire, so we are stuck with a mediocre one. That\u2019s right. Right. That\u2019s Bach. But then he didn\u2019t get the job. Uh, he \u2014 he took \u2014 he got the job three years later. So it\u2019s a Catholic mass, because the King of Poland was Catholic. That\u2019s the only reason why it\u2019s Catholic. Because he was Lutheran, himself. Bach\u2019s Mass in B Minor is indeed a musical setting of a complete Latin Mass. But in the centuries since its completion shortly before Bach\u2019s death in 1750, it has become widely recognized as one of the great musical works of all time. The esteemed atheist scientist Stephen Jay Gould proposed that this should be THE piece of music presented in a first contact with an alien race: \u201CIt is the best,\u201D he said, \u201Cof who we are.\u201D You can listen again, watch, and share this conversation with Bernard Chazelle through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: I\u2019m with a computer scientist, Bernard Chazelle of Princeton, discovering the cosmology of Johann Sebastian Bach. We spoke in front of a live audience at the Jerome L. Greene Performance Space in Lower Manhattan, as part of Bachstock \u2014 WQXR New York\u2019s month long celebration of Bach. Bernard Chazelle is an original thinker about the mathematical sophistication and the deep humanity of this great 18th Century composer. He\u2019s been describing how, just as mathematicians talk about discovering rather than inventing great equations, Bach set out to \u201Cdiscover\u201D the musical rules behind the universe. There\u2019s a fashionable way to talk about Bach, and not just Bach, but particularly him, to say, he was a product of Christian princes and Christian elites, and if he had lived in another time, he would have written brilliantly, but less religiously. But, I think the way you hear him, and understand him as a human being, um, that orientation he had, um, as you say, of discovering God\u2019s music rather than creating something for himself, or even for the world\u2026 Yes. \u2026is absolutely central also to the music he made. Yeah, yeah. Whether he would have said it that way or not. Yes. You know, there\u2019s a beautiful insight by Richard Taruskin, who is a very, very highly-regarded music historian from Berkeley, who\u2019s written this massive history of western music. Just remarkable achievement. And he said the music of Bach is not a medium of beauty, it\u2019s a medium of truth. And this is very interesting, because within the rules, the strict rules of counterpoint Bach does not care if it does not sound good. Like, he loves dissonances. He will stick all this chromaticism within two bars, and not, so, sometimes you wonder what was he thinking? He was pursuing a certain idea of truth of these rules of music. And whether it sounded good or not, he could not care less. So, that, too, is something he was not trying to give pleasure to people. In fact, people complained they didn\u2019t like his music. It was too complicated, too operatic, too showy. He just shrugged his shoulders and said, well, that\u2019s just too bad. I\u2019m not working for you. I\u2019m working for God. So complain to God. He was trying to take dictation from God. Although, he did draw on folk music. There was \u2014 music\u2026 Yes. \u2026was democratic in a way, then, and dance, and so\u2026 Yes. \u2026at the same time, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s impervious to\u2026 No. What Bach looked\u2026 \u2026to music as a part of ordinary life. Bach loved the opera. I mean, we know this, because he used to go to the opera all the time. And he played in coffee houses. He had his own band with his family. Right. They\u2019re very talented people. Yeah. And they would play in coffee had just been introduced or maybe not just, but had become very popular to go to coffee houses. It was a new concept. He wrote a coffee cantata, which is very, you know, it\u2019s fun. It\u2019d be like pop music now. I mean, high-quality pop music. So, he had that aspect of him. I mean, he was a fun-loving guy. he got in trouble with the law. I mean, he went to prison. He got into fights. He was a real\u2026 Yeah. So\u2026 \u2026human being. And\u2026 \u2026and I think I wanted to pick up on the idea of dissonance dissonance in music, and in life. And I don\u2019t want to simplify this, so I want you to push back if I am. You\u2019ve said that dissonance was something that renaissance musicians have called \u2014 that musicians had even spoken about in divine terms, right? That our ears naturally don\u2019t like dissonance, although we work with it powerfully. There\u2019s this half-octave dissonance, what is it called? The tri\u2026 Tri-tone. Tri-tone, that renaissance musicians called the satanic interval. So, actually before we started, Tim played this satanic interval for us. And he recorded. Can we hear it? OK. So we know that. I want to hear a little bit more about how Bach worked with dissonance. You know here\u2019s something very interesting you wrote that, think of dissonance as, and you said, \u2014 you didn\u2019t say the f-word, but I\u2019m going to say the f-word. This is public radio. Think of dissonance as the f-word in comedy used to transgress, to liberate, to ridicule, to humanize, to bring down to earth, to change topics. It feels to me, as much as you sense this high mathematical sophistication in Bach, you most of all value him and are captivated by him as this most human of composers. Somebody who lost perhaps 10 children in his lifetime. Who lost his wife. Talk a little bit about how he worked with dissonance in life, and in music, and in music as an expression of a real complex messy life. Yeah. So there, too, he\u2019s very surprising. For example, at the end of this show, we\u2019re going to hear the chaconne, which is a very remarkable piece at the end of a suite, made of small, not too long, little pieces, they\u2019re dances. The chaconne is a dance, but it\u2019s longer than all of the other movements combined. It seems like he added it on because he went on a trip and he came back and his wife was dead. She was buried already, actually. In those days, trips took a long time. And he was devastated by this. And he wrote music, he wrote a dance. Now, it\u2019s very sad music, too, but there\u2019s these \u2014 in the St. John Passion, the very end, the next to last movement, is this lullaby \u201CRuht Wohl,\u201D you know, \u201Crest well,\u201D where he\u2019s singing over the tomb of Jesus. And you would think, I mean, this is the most solemn moment in the Christian calendar of the year, and he just has a little lullaby. Very sweet, very gentle. And so, what\u2019s going on there? What\u2019s happening? And, you know, I like to think, to simplify things, that as opposed to other composers, Bach targets the very young, the child, and people of a certain age, like me. And tries to leave out the middle. And what I mean by this is that there are all kinds of mental, psychological dispositions from the opera that he totally shunned. Envy. Greed. Lust. Jealousy. I mean, this is the bread and butter of the opera. He never went there. He had no interest in that. His music tries to express things like, awe. Grace. Thanks. Fear. Trepidation. Hope. All kinds of sentiments a child can have, and an older person can have, but none of this sexual nonsense in the middle. And, so, in that sense, he thinks of death very differently from his own experience. I mean, he lost his parents before he was 10. He lost both of his parents, and then he lost half of his children. He lost 10 children. Mm-hmm. And, so, these are different different times, different circumstances, and for us, it can be very surprising to see these reactions. Right. And I think your point he works in a very complicated way with that. One doesn\u2019t sense he didn\u2019t feel things deeply, right? Oh, no. No. The opposite. On the contrary. I mean, you can tell from his music that his emotion is raw. I mean, it is so controlled, but it is so profound. Right. This is a man who truly grieves. I mean, you\u2019ll hear the chaconne. It\u2019s a dance. But it\u2019s a grieving dance. I know, it seems like a paradox. But it\u2019s extremely moving and \u2014 of somebody who clearly has enormous feeling. And, yet, it\u2019s very controlled. So, if I can go back quickly to this Taruskin point about truth, I find this very interesting, because I thought a lot about this. And what about? The\u2026 So, Taruskin said, Bach is not about beauty. Oh, yes. But about truth. He\u2019s about truth. Well, he said, truth of what? Well, you have, of course, if you think of Newton, God\u2019s truth. So, the universe \u2014 the musical universe. So, that makes sense. But I\u2019d like to take this even further, and, you know, somewhat historical nonsense, if you will, but I still believe there\u2019s merit to it. So let me try this. You know, Immanuel Kant, Immanuel Kant is a good half-century, 50 years, after Bach. So clearly Bach was not influenced by somebody who lived 50 years later. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But Kant had a very interesting take on freedom. And and this will connect to this. So, he listened to Hume, and he said, Hume\u2019s got it exactly wrong. So, Hume said that reason is the slave. It must be, and ought to be, the slave to our passions. So you know, for most people, when you say what does it mean to be free, they might say something like this. Well, it\u2019s to be able to do what we want. So if you\u2019re in prison, there are many things you want, but you\u2019re not able to do them, so you\u2019re not free. So in that sentence, the key word is able. To be able, capital Able\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026to do what we want. And Kant said this is all wrong. The key word is want. It\u2019s not able. And for Kant, freedom has to come from inside. And the only thing that comes from inside is reason. Or so he thought. And so, now, how do we go back to this disposition of Bach, which is that, I think, beyond truth, he also wanted to have freedom. In the following sense, he put all these rules so that once you are within the rules, it allows you to fly very, very high. Right. And then, you can be free. You\u2019re not tied to \u2014 so he\u2019s not going to do lust, and sex. These are too easy, and it takes your music into things where you don\u2019t have a freedom, because your emotions are taking you somewhere. So he would be horrified by a lot of pop music where basically the first time you hear is the emotion. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m very mad. Brr. Then \u2014 you\u2019re something it doesn\u2019t work like this. Because your anger is driving your music. But that\u2019s not freedom. And so I think he was actually looking for a medium of truth and freedom. Ironically. And when you wrote, \u201Clike Ellington, he doesn\u2019t do despair.\u201D I mean, what you mean is, he chooses not to let despair\u2026 Yeah. Ms. Tippett: \u2026have the last word or the last note. Yeah. So, for us, it\u2019s very hard to tell, because we were not there, and it\u2019s just so hard to imagine how one could cope with such horrible tragedies on, and on, and on, and on. But I think his faith was so big, that despair for him would have been sinful. It\u2019s like, would it have been self-indulgence to despair just simply to believe in myself more than I believe in God? Because he still believed that God was looking out for him. I mean, I would wonder, given the circumstances, but he really believed that. And, maybe that\u2019s how you had to be in order to survive in those days. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today in a live conversation at the Greene Space in New York City with computer scientist Bernard Chazelle on the \u201Ccosmology\u201D of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. I sense, and again, I may be making this up, but, there\u2019s something in your writing that \u2014 there\u2019s something about \u2014 there\u2019s a consonance, or some kind of kinship between the universality of music for you, maybe, and the universality of code? Is that right? I don\u2019t mind making that up. You mean computer code? Yeah. I never thought I never of that. But, why not? Well, it seems to me\u2026 It seems to me that those are qualities that you love and revere and play with, and like. No\u2026 Imaginatively engaging. \u2026I don\u2019t care that much about coding. You don\u2019t care that much about code? No. I mean, I care about mathematics. But something somewhat related perhaps? What I find very strange is this. That I think what\u2019s magnificent about Bach is that when you listen to this music, and it moves you so much, I mean, it\u2019s just a bunch of sound waves crashing into your ear, and you have to contain \u2014 you see this emotion bubbling up, you start seeing, like, tearing up, and saying, well, what\u2019s going on? These are just sounds crashing into my \u2014 what\u2019s going on in here? So, of course, you could say, well, it\u2019s just Bach. He\u2019s a genius. You know, that\u2019s just the way it works. No, not so easy. I have to have the ability in my brain to create that emotion. I mean, all Bach is doing is sending a bunch of sound waves. I have to be able \u2014 and when I say I, I mean everybody. Yeah. And so, I\u2019m always like \u2014 there\u2019s something extremely optimistic and really almost dizzying when you hear something, and it moves you so intensely inside. And you realize, but this is you who is being moved. Nobody\u2019s forcing this inside you. So in your brain, there must be this reservoir of beauty which most often is untapped, goes untapped. But if you can find it with the right spotlight, then you discover this amazing consonances, or dissonances, or this amazing narrative, story, inside you. So I don\u2019t want to make this solipsistic. I\u2019m not saying we have our own music and so on. But I still think there\u2019s something completely remarkable that we are capable of appreciating this to that level. To me, this surprises me more than, say, a poem or something, because a poem often, you know where it comes from. Because there\u2019s a story. You relate to events in your life. It moves you because\u2026 You just see what is happening it\u2026 \u2026you see what\u2019s happening\u2026 \u2026you know what is happening. Yeah. \u2026because you think of people\u2026 And your memories. \u2026you can think of events\u2026 Right. \u2026there\u2019s this whole thing. Music, you have no idea why am I being moved? It\u2019s just a bunch of notes. What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s like a ghost is taking over. And yet, it\u2019s all inside you. And so, I think there\u2019s a message for all this, it\u2019s that, all these people out there who have no beauty or so little beauty in their lives, and you think that basically is just everything is ugly, and maybe most of it for them is ugly, that they have to know that there is this possibility, just inside them, there\u2019s this enormous gold mine that \u2014 that can be revealed. And of course, Bach is not the only one. There are others. Everybody has to find their own way. But I really think that its\u2019 really wrong to say, well, I\u2019m just a vessel, and the genius out there is just \u2014 well, yeah, but that\u2019s too easy. I think we have to have more self-respect and saying that, actually, you know, there\u2019s something wonderful inside me. And I think we should be grateful and appreciate that. And give others an opportunity to discover that in themselves. Mm. Sort of those aesthetic virtues. So. You have said that you dislike concert halls. That concert halls are like secular churches. And no one is allowed to express emotion unless they\u2019re prompted, and you\u2019re such a peasant if you applaud at the wrong time. Yeah. Yeah. And that in fact that\u2019s not the way it worked when this music was being created. No. That it was much rowdier. Yeah. And I, you know, I actually think, I think churches used to be rowdier, too. Yeah. Um\u2026 Yes. I think we\u2019re stuck with this, but it\u2019s really tragic. I mean, first of all, there are two things going on here. First of all, the concept of playing dead composers is fairly recent. It\u2019s 19th century. Why did Bach have to write music every single week? They could have played old Palestrina music until the people dropped. I mean, there are tons of music to play. You didn\u2019t have to compose something. But you had to play something that was fresh. You would never play dead music. Dead people music. Now today, you go to a concert hall, and everybody has to behave, and the composers, all the good ones are dead. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say that. OK. I know. We know. We know. You don\u2019t mean that. OK. This is bleeped. What I\u2019m saying is they want you to believe \u2014 they want you to believe that everybody is good are all dead, and we\u2019re going to worship as we should. I mean, so now the concert hall is a museum, or like a chapel, or something like this. So, that\u2019s what I love about jazz. Because that\u2019s just not the way, or let\u2019s hope it\u2019s never the way. Go to a jazz club, and it seems living. This is a living, you know, expression. By and large, classical music, there\u2019s so much respect for the art form that, say, improvisation is not encouraged. But this is crazy. I mean, Beethoven was probably the biggest improviser ever. Bach would improvise for hours at the organ. It\u2019s not just that he could, that is the way they did music. It was just to improvise, to change. They used to take other people\u2019s music, and that\u2019s how you learned your trade \u2014 your craft, is by taking other people\u2019s music and rewriting it. Take this Vivaldi concerto and make it better. That was perfectly accepted. That was the way people did things. They didn\u2019t worry about intellectual rights\u2026 They didn\u2019t have copyright, yeah. \u2026going to get a patent. I\u2019m going to be sued because, you know\u2026 Yeah. \u2026it was living. It was like people talk. We don\u2019t worry that \u2014 the sentence I\u2019m just saying has been said before, and I have to clear it with my lawyer or something. So, maybe there is something, I don\u2019t know, has been lost. Yeah. This lovely line of yours that \u201CBach, the most human of all composers, gets to your soul through the body.\u201D That\u2019s an example, I think, of something \u2014 that kind of thing gets said, but somehow it\u2019s a very beautiful, poetic sentence and it\u2019s worth saying again. And repeating. I wonder if there\u2019s something for you in the experience of Bach that captures for you what maybe religion should be. I don\u2019t know if you are religious now or if spirituality is a word you use in any way. But how does Bach express that aspect of humanity to you? So I think it expresses in two ways. In one way, it is so human, it touches your body. It touches your soul, but via your body. If you don\u2019t feel like crying, you\u2019re not appreciating Bach. It has to be physical. Right. It\u2019s not intellectual. OK. And so there\u2019s that. But there\u2019s also, when you face excellence, you know, you watch the Olympics, you watch the Superbowl, you watch tennis, you watch \u2014 whatever is your thing, and there\u2019s something really there\u2019s a particular pleasure in seeing something done extremely well. OK. Just this level of perfection. And so, when you see Bach, you see the ultimate expression of this. There\u2019s something strange because I think there\u2019s very little disagreement that Bach is the best composer of written music. OK. I insist on written music. And, that\u2019s not true of any other field. There is no best mathematician that people agree upon. There\u2019s no best painter. There\u2019s no best writer. There\u2019s no best poet. No, there are lots of great, but there\u2019s no \u2014 but Bach completely towers over anybody else. And so when you listen to this, you say, well, where is this coming from? So you would think this is going to be so distant and alien, because it\u2019s so great. It\u2019s like the sun. You can\u2019t look at it. But it\u2019s like the sun, except you can actually wallow in it. You can just watch it, and be devoured by it. And it\u2019s this paradox that does not happen \u2014 it\u2019s a greatness that\u2019s very inviting. And so, in that sense, there\u2019s something a bit religious, because it\u2019s like seeing a mountain. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from. There is this mystery. Now this man virtually spent no time composing. This is so hard to believe. A cantata is about the size of a Beatles\u2019 album. Well\u2026 He virtually had just a couple of hours to compose the music. Oh, you mean, \u2014 but he \u2014 every day. Every day. No, no, but most day was spent copying, rehearsing. OK. Practicing. Getting his musicians. The time he had to actually think, well, now, what\u2019s the melody like? Was just a few hours to write something of the size of, you know, an entire Beatles\u2019 album. Actually it\u2019s more music than that. You know, Christoph Wolff, \u201CVolf\u201D I should say, German pronunciation, says you know, the \u201CSt. Matthew Passion\u201D \u2014 he probably wrote it in or three weeks, he said, to their professional composer would have to take a three-year leave of absence\u2026 \u2026to write something of this \u2014 of course, not something as good, that\u2019s impossible. But something of that scale would take three years for a professional composer. He\u2019d do it, you know, two, three weeks. It\u2019s incomprehensible because science does not work like this. All scientists, the greatest scientists worked on one idea extremely hard. Extremely \u2014 they totally were possessed by it for years and years. There\u2019s no, like, you wake up, and then E=MC2. Now, it doesn\u2019t work like that. But for Bach, it seems to have worked like that. And that\u2019s a mystery. But right. But there is also something in him, his work ethic was also incredible, right? I mean, there was\u2026 Yeah. \u2026there was a way in which he\u2026 Yes. \u2026 he defied human limitations. Yes. I mean, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019d read Malcolm Gladwell Yeah, 10,000. Right? Back then. Yeah. So I mean\u2026 He put in 10,000 hours. \u2026there \u2014 I mean, yes, it\u2019s mysterious, but there\u2019s also a sense in which he was so invested hour after hour, day after day, week after week, year after year. Yes. And you know, in those days, false\u2026 It is that human combination. \u2026false modesty was not something that, you know, people were doing. And, Bach is quoted several times saying that, um, that anybody who works as hard as I do will compose music that every bit as good. Now you would think, yeah sure. But no. There\u2019s evidence that he really believed that. Yeah. And to him, to work very hard was to glorify God. Because to be lazy would be insulting God. So, his work ethic was not just that\u2019s the way he was brought up. That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s because it was part of his belief system. I\u2019m going to just ask you one final question and I do want to return to the computer scientist in you, if he has anything more to say. This life that you spend with algorithm, with music, with a passion for both of these things. How did these things together shape your sense as it has evolved of what it means to be human? So I think the thing I\u2019ll say about mathematics is that it\u2019s my case, but it\u2019s the case of every practicing mathematician I know, that we do it for aesthetic reasons. I know it\u2019s hard for people to believe how this could be true, but the only thing that drives us is the beauty of the discovery of these\u2026 Right, so for you, it\u2019s the opposite\u2026 \u2026these structures of these things. \u2026it\u2019s not true. That it\u2019s about beauty. Beauty and truth are intertwined. Yes. In this case, yeah, because in mathematics, they\u2019re absolutely identical. No, they\u2019re not identical. I mean, beauty is a subset of truth. If it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s ugly, by definition. Right. In mathematics. Right. But \u2014 and some true mathematics is not beautiful. But without truth, there\u2019s no beauty. What gets people up in the morning and work hard is \u2014 and mathematics is very hard. I mean, I know it\u2019s a truism to say that, but it\u2019s something that you really have to apply yourself for years and years. And what moves us is really the sense of having structure, discovering a universe that\u2019s totally beyond us. There must be a platonic value out there somewhere, and \u2014 because this is so \u2014 in that sense, it\u2019s similar to Bach, because it\u2019s not driven by emotion. Mathematics has no anger. There\u2019s no \u2014 I mean, yeah, there\u2019s envy in the sociology, but \u2014 but the mathematics itself\u2026 \u2026a theorem is a theorem. And it\u2019s not really subjective, also. A beautiful theorem is beautiful for every mathematician. There\u2019s no\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026oh, school of mathematics, well, we don\u2019t like this kind of theorem. No, there\u2019s no such thing. People can recognize beauty just like anybody with a brain will recognize Bach\u2019s music is gorgeous. I think. I hope. OK. Well, I think everyone here understands why I invited you to be the person we spoke with tonight. And now I want to introduce a little bit more music from Bach, which I think we will hear with new ears. So please welcome Tim Fain, who will perform the Chaconne from Bach\u2019s \u201CPartita for Violin Number 2\u201D. Bernard Chazelle is Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. You can listen to this episode again and share it, or watch my entire conversation with Bernard Chazelle in New York, at onbeing.org. There you can also read a wonderful essay he wrote, \u201CMy Favorite Things By Bach.\u201D And, hear violinist Tim Fain\u2019s entire performance of Bach\u2019s monumental Chaconne, as he played it for us live."
