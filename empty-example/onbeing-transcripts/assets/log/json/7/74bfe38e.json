  "fullText": "Sr. Simone Campbell became a national figure \u2014 a bit of a religious rock star \u2014 as a face of the \u201CNuns on the Bus.\u201D She is a lawyer and lobbyist in addition to being a nun, a poet, and a serious Zen practitioner. Sr. Simone is a helpful voice for longings so many of us share, across many differences, about how to engage with the well-being of our neighbors in this complicated age. In a live conversation at our studios on Loring Park, it was moving to see the regard in which Sr. Simone is held \u2014 and the way she joins activism, contemplation, and a fresh, authentic personal wisdom. I sometimes think we, in the United States, think we ought to do something about everything and that it\u2019s my job to fix everything. Well it\u2019s not. That\u2019s way beyond us. It\u2019s more important, I think, that we listen deeply to our stories and then see where it leads. If we all do our part in community\u2026 Whatever our part is, wherever we are. Whatever our part is. Just do one thing. That\u2019s all we have to do. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Simone Campbell is the executive Director of NETWORK \u2014 a lobbying organization created to represent people on the margins of society on Capitol Hill. Their mission includes \u201Cmending the wealth gap,\u201D \u201Cenacting a living wage,\u201D and \u201Ccrafting a faithful budget that benefits the 100 percent.\u201D Sr. Simone grew up in southern California, became animated by the Civil Rights movement, and took first vows with the Catholic order of the Sisters of Social Service in 1967. Simone, welcome. Thank you. So much. And tell me this \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to me when I read about your early life that there was anything that pointed at, necessarily, or dictated that you would enter a religious order in that spiritual background of your childhood. Probably not. I was a spiritual kid. When I was about 4 or 5, I heard my mom teaching catechism to the older kids, probably second grade. And I heard that the mass was a miracle. And got to study what the priests did, figuring out what the miracle was. Well, what I saw was him pouring water and wine into the chalice and putting his hands over it like, abracadabra. And then I think my attention wandered for a bit because the next thing I knew, he was wiping out the chalice. So I figured that the miracle was he made the water and wine disappear. And so my discovery of a spiritual sense was kind of magical in the beginning. And \u2014 but I also knew that nobody talked about what the miracle was. So I just kept the secret to myself \u2019til I was a grown up. But I think what mattered most to me as a young person was that Jesus had \u2014 in a sense had consequences \u2014 that it was part of life. And I realized, looking back, that I spent a lot of energy trying to include everybody. And that piece, I think, probably had the most spiritual nuggets of \u2014 that\u2019s led me to this religious life. And being a Sister of Social Service is kind of a \u2014 what can I say \u2014 kind of a rabble rousing crowd anyway. And the Sisters of \u2014 there\u2019s quite a complex family tree of catholicism, right? And of religious orders\u2026 Yes. And many of them, we\u2019ve heard \u2014 well some of them, we\u2019ve heard a lot about. And this is one of these branches that\u2019s, I think, you\u2019ve made well-known: the Sisters of Social Service. It\u2019s a really interesting \u2014 you follow the rule of St. Benedict. But it\u2019s a community with a long history, a long lineage of this intersection of faith and politics. Right, right. Because our founding was really in Hungary in 1923, and then in Los Angeles in 1926. And our foundress, Margaret Slachta, was the first woman in parliament in Hungary when she was the head of our community. And the sisters there started the first schools of social work, started \u2014 organized juvenile detention facilities that were humane and educated kids. And our foundress, Margaret, said that, well, if God would \u2014 bless the people who wiped away the tears of people who suffered. Wouldn\u2019t God also bless the people who made it so that tears were not shed? And it was that insight that combined the charity and justice aspect of our mission. And for me, it\u2019s been really a wonderful adventure. And, you know, it\u2019s an unfamiliar trajectory now in the 21st century to think of an 18-year-old young woman \u2014\u00A0I mean, I think there are so many things about you also that defy stereotypes about nuns, if people have stereotypes about nuns, or they just don\u2019t know much about nuns. I mean, I really love this picture on the cover of your book, where I think you look like a friendly, successful, formidable lawyer, perhaps, in your amazing red dress. Well, I am\u2026 And you are a lawyer. Right? Which I didn\u2019t even know when I started hearing about you and the \u201CNuns on the Bus.\u201D So in 2004, you were invited, I believe \u2014 you were recruited to become the executive director of this lobbying organization NETWORK. Right. So you were nun, sister, poet, lawyer, lobbyist. Again, and what \u2014 NETWORK \u2014 does NETWORK stand for something? No. OK. But the reason we have it all in capitals is because\u2026 Yeah. Why is it all in capitals? It\u2019s because the founding mothers wanted to be sure that it stood out in the list of other organizations. OK. Right. So they said, \u201CIt shall be all capitals.\u201D So when you start, your very first day you are told. Yeah. I thought, \u201CWow, what does this stand for?\u201D I know. It\u2019s a very long sentence. No, no. It doesn\u2019t stand for anything. Founded in 1972, 47 Catholic sisters founded this thing on a shoestring budget. Right. $187 that they collected. Really? Yeah. They passed around a bag and collected it. And that was it. And what did they want? They want \u2014 they didn\u2019t want another organization. But what they wanted was a network of the sisters in the United States to \u2014 who were doing charity at the time, but the call really was to do systemic change. To work to change the federal policies. And required us to be active on Capitol Hill. So the whole plan was, as Senator Kennedy used to call us, \u201Cthe nuns\u2019 lobby.\u201D And even though we didn\u2019t\u2026 Did he really? He called you the \u201Cnuns\u2019 lobby?\u201D Yeah. He called us the \u201Cnuns\u2019 lobby.\u201D Yeah. And so we grew and became lay folks. And when I started, it was probably maybe about half sisters, half lay folks as members. But the whole idea was to affect policy on Capitol Hill. Get Catholic social tradition, Catholic social teaching into the best of who we are and make policy based on real life needs. That was our goal. I want to \u2014 you said somewhere that over the years, your spirituality and prayer life have deepened to become what you called a contemplative life of \u201Cwalking willing\u201D \u2014 that defines who you are and how you do this work and, I think, how this work continues to evolve both in vision and action. So, what do you mean by that? What does that connote? Well now the \u2014 OK, the heart of who I am is the contemplative. And Gerald May, in this amazing book Will and Spirit, says that the only thing that we bring to the contemplative life is a willing heart. And that the two things that shut down the contemplative life are fear and holding on, grasping. And so what I\u2019ve come to realize is that, for me, this journey is about continuing to walk willing towards the hope, the vision, the perspective, the opportunities that are given. But it\u2019s all about where people are hungry. I get invited to where people are hungry. And I\u2019m willing to try to be food for them, just be available, just be present, and listen to their stories or tell mine and \u2014 but it\u2019s all about keeping my heart open to what\u2019s around. And not closing up. Because one of the things I\u2019ve discovered \u2014 because some people say, \u201COh, you travel all the time. That must be exhausting.\u201D The only time I get tired is if I start worrying about me. If I start focusing on myself thinking, \u201COh my god,\u201D looking at my schedule, \u201CIt\u2019s terrible \u2014 ra-ra-ra.\u201D Then I lose energy. But the whole contemplative life thing is about \u201Cwalking willing\u201D aware that we\u2019re one body, and that I\u2019ll be nourished in the process if I give myself over to this bigger need. But I do know about you also that you have a serious Zen practice. Yep. That that\u2019s also part of your contemplative life. And that you do, as busy as you are, and as big a job as you have, you also do \u2014 you do cultivate that. And I think you take time away \u2014 you go on retreat. You do take time to immerse in meditation and contemplation. Absolutely. I mean, I meditate every morning. I mean, it\u2019s essential. It\u2019s essential. What is that? What has the addition of the \u2014 you were contemplative before you had a Zen practice. But it\u2019s a different approach. It\u2019s a different lineage. What does that add? How does that complexify your contemplative life? I think what it was for me \u2014 the first time I did a Zen retreat, it was at our retreat house my community runs in Encino. And it was like, I don\u2019t know \u2014 it was like diving into this pool, this refreshing pool. It was so exciting. I didn\u2019t want to go to bed at night. I was really a little nuts. But for me \u2014 I had been dabbling in centering prayer and trying to find a way. But this was like a doorway to a form that could be used in any \u2014 Zen can be used with any content because Zen is the discipline of the meditation. And \u2014 OK, so my experience was this, of meeting, of having in my imagination the sense of a sage. Saying \u2014 inviting me to go deeper. And that \u2014 being willing to do that was the biggest gift of my life ever. And being willing to know that \u2014 how can I say this? Well, to know that we\u2019re one body. All of creation is one body. And I\u2019m only just a little piece of it. But the freedom of knowing that means I just have to do my part. It\u2019s \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know how to communicate how freeing that is. And I think what you\u2019re describing is really being immersed in that knowledge, that\u2026 It\u2019s visceral. The knowing. It\u2019s not here. It\u2019s here. It\u2019s in the guts. It\u2019s like, \u201CYes.\u201D So being able to then\u2026 To come\u2026 \u2026walk out of meditation and live out of that place. Right. Because on the cushion, doing the Zen is the easy part of the contemplative life. The harder part is the living in relationship, the living it out, the consistently trying to do what I call deep listening, listening to the needs around me, listening to what I\u2019m \u2014 where we\u2019re being nudged and drawn, listening to people\u2019s stories, listening to the murmurs inside of me. That\u2019s the tougher part. And the sitting part is just \u2014 I say it\u2019s like this: life\u2019s like a snow globe and it gets all shaken up. And then sitting, doing Zen, you put the snow globe down, and it all sinks down. And there\u2019s clarity. For one brief shining moment every now and then. But I must say that my current little mantra is \u2014 to God is, \u201CWake me up. Please wake me up.\u201D So I feel like I need a new waking up. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Sr. Simone Campbell of the \u201CNuns on the Bus.\u201D We\u2019re at our studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. The impetus for the original \u201CNuns on the Bus\u201D tour came from the U.S. House of Representatives budget plan to cut spending on social services, as well as a reprimand, that same year, of the small lobbying organization Sr. Simone runs together with the wider leadership of American Catholic sisters. There have now been three tours to 25 states, with stops and conversation all along the road with all kinds of people, about matters like living wage, the wealth gap, and health care. So in 2010, \u201911, \u201912, you were running this organization that was doing great and important work. And you were worried, as a good executive director would be, about how to get the word out\u2026 Yes. \u2026about marketing. Branding, they tell me. Branding. Branding. Ugh. Right. And the Vatican came along\u2026. I know\u2026 \u2026as you tell the story and provided that. Wasn\u2019t it nice of \u2018em? Yes, absolutely. I mean, well, it was our 40th anniversary on April 14th, 2012. And that was a big question, \u201CHow do we get the word out?\u201D And then four days later, the Vatican answered our prayer by naming, naming our little organization in the censure of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. I still can\u2019t quite believe they did it. We only had nine full time staff at the time and we made the whole Vatican nervous? I mean that was just like beyond, beyond\u2026 And the sign of Pentecost, really \u2014 it was a Pentecost moment \u2014 is that no one knows who first said \u201Croad trip.\u201D But at the end of an hour-and-a-half meeting, we were going on the road. We were pushing back against the Ryan budget. We were lifting up the works of Catholic sisters. And going in a bus. And they told me it had to be a wrapped bus. And I had no idea what a wrapped bus was. I was so afraid it had something to do with rap music. And then only to discover that it was \u201CW-R-A-P.\u201D Right. You know, it\u2019s the wallpaper on the bus. But we knew nothing. We were totally \u2014 and that was an example of \u201Cwalking willing\u201D because it was the idea, it was the consensus of the group. I had no idea what it meant. I had no idea where it would lead. But\u2026 You didn\u2019t know it would lead to nine states, 2,700 miles, two weeks. Right. And after the first one, we didn\u2019t even do an evaluation because I never thought there would be a second one. So, yes. We had no idea where it was going. But that\u2019s \u201Cwalking willing:\u201D doing the best you can with all the nudges around. So I did just really impress my 16-year-old son by telling him that you were not only on \u2014 you were on both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. I know, it\u2019s pretty amazing. Yeah. But I think so many of us \u2014 we heard about the \u201CNuns on the Bus.\u201D It became this phrase. And there\u2019s this language of the nones, the N-O-N-E-S. Right. The \u2014 what I call the new non-religious. And when that\u2019s kind of thrown into a public discussion, I\u2019ll often say, \u201CNot nuns as in the \u2018Nuns on the Bus.\u2019\u201D I mean, you\u2019ve entered the lexicon. Our trademark \u2014 we trademarked the title, you know? You did? And our trademark lawyer is very worried that it has entered into culture because then you don\u2019t have much of a trademark. See? You\u2019re still thinking about branding like a good executive director. But that experience \u2014 I mean, beyond all the hype \u2014 and there was a lot of great hype \u2014 and eventually speaking at the Democratic Convention and going to the White House. But what did \u2014 did that \u2014 I have to I think from what I\u2019ve read and in just the little bit I spoke with you before that it plunged you in a whole new way into the world that you were, in Washington, lobbying for. Yeah. That\u2019s a good way to say it. I think the great gift of the bus \u2014 among the great gifts of the bus, are that it put us in contact with folks all over the country. And we became a way for them to find hope, to find community, to come together. On this last bus trip this past fall on voter turnout, we \u2014 everybody who pledged to vote got to sign the bus. That became like magic, magic. And I was with some people in Chicago \u2014 some sisters in Chicago who had been with us in Chicago. And they had looked on the bus to find their sisters from Iowa who had signed the bus earlier. And who else did they know? And then by the time we got to Colorado, the thing was filled. And so everybody\u2019s looking for friends and \u2014 so it became a rolling experience of community. And that\u2019s the piece that I think the bus is about because all are welcome on the bus. And that is something that is missing, missing deeply in our nation right now that all could be welcome. I really like the way you talk about being for the 100 percent. You know? I mean, in some ways, a lot of the issues you take up and the policies you take up are maybe, in a superficial way, associated with this language of the 99 percent, which had its moment and it\u2019s had its meaning. Right. Well, and it set it up for me to be able to say the 100 percent. It\u2019s perfect. But yeah. Exactly. Set it up. But that you do \u2014 you talk about \u201Cwe the people,\u201D and you talk about being for the 100 percent. Well, it\u2019s because everybody\u2019s story has a place. But no one should be dominating the rest of the community. And that piece is \u2014 I got this chance to talk \u2014 we\u2019re doing business roundtables, and I got this chance to talk to some entrepreneur, C.E.O. types. And so I got to ask them finally this question that I\u2019ve been really wondering about which was \u2014 the report was that the average C.E.O. of a publicly traded company got $10 million in salary a year, and they were going for 11 million. And so I got to ask them, \u201CWell guys, I\u2019m kind of curious about this. Is it that they\u2019re not getting by on 10 million that they need 11 million? I don\u2019t get it.\u201D And this one guy said, just like this \u2014 he said, \u201COh, no Sister Simone. That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s not about the money.\u201D He said, \u201CIt\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re very competitive. And we want to win. And money just happens to be the current measure of winning.\u201D And then I think, well, could we have a measure that\u2019s a little less toxic? Because that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not that they want to hoard this money, they want to win. And so if we can understand for the common good what is underlying their desire, and then we could find some other measures that would free up money, so they pay some decent wages for heaven\u2019s sakes. So anyway, it was an interesting conversation. But seeing \u2014 having the curiosity to see their perspective allows for finding new solutions. Because if we just fight and resist \u2014 this is the other piece about contemplative life. If we just fight against something, it reinforces it. You wrote, \u201CStaying open-handed, treasuring but not grasping, is critical to the contemplative stance. I also believe that\u2019s how we have to think of our economic life together.\u201D Yes. That\u2019s a really intriguing statement. Say some more. Well, if we\u2019re open-handed, then I know a few things. One is no guarantees. All is fragile. It\u2019s all gift. And it also needs to be shared. And being willing to share what I have or what I have been given then becomes the way that we can really engage each other. And one of the pieces that gets lost is it\u2019s as much monetary as it is our stories. And that creates the bond of community where then the economy is better because we build each other up. How could I leave you out if I\u2019ve heard your story? I can\u2019t. So I have to make sure you\u2019re OK. Check in every now and then. But you know, I mean, we\u2019re kind of rediscovering story in all kinds of ways. But even stories get \u2014 they get woven artfully into political speeches, right? And so that\u2019s not saying you\u2019re wrong, but we still have to work\u2026 Well you know one of the problems with most of the stories in the political speeches is somebody else went out and found the story. And then it gets slipped into a politician\u2019s talk. I mean, the president does it in the State of the Union. I\u2019ve been asked for stories. Right. But the problem is, is the real power of story is to let my heart be broken by the story, to hear it from you directly or to hear it from whoever directly. Then I\u2019m never the same. And \u2014 as opposed to using it as a good shtick. I mean, you tell a lot of stories of people you met on the road. And they\u2019re the kind of stories that we\u2019re becoming familiar with. Stories of good people who are working too many jobs and still not getting by. Stories of college students who are carrying way too much to be able to focus on that. Stories of people who don\u2019t have the money to get the care they need and die too young. I am aware in myself and I think all around me, maybe, those of you in this room \u2014 there are so many of us are so anguished about these gulfs that seem to be growing in our society, in our community, and in our nation. And it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care. You know, we care deeply. But we don\u2019t know how to connect that care in meaningful, practical ways. To do something about it. Well, I think there\u2019s \u2014 there are several levels of that. One is the doing something. I sometimes think we, in the United States, think we ought to do something about everything and that it\u2019s my job to fix everything. Well it\u2019s not. That\u2019s way beyond us. It\u2019s more important, I think, that we listen deeply to our stories and then see where it leads. And that\u2019s the piece. If we all do our part\u2026 Whatever our part is, wherever we are. Whatever our part is. Just do one thing. That\u2019s all we have to do. But the guilt of the \u2014 or the curse of the progressive, the liberal, the whatever is that we think we have to do it all. And then we get overwhelmed. And I get all those solicitations in the mail. And I can\u2019t do everything. And so I don\u2019t do anything. But that\u2019s the mistake. Community is about just doing my part. I \u2014 oh, can I? No, go on, yes. Can I tell you? I decided \u2014 you know how in the scripture it \u2014 Paul says how we\u2019re one body? Not everybody is an ear, not everybody is an eye. So one day I was meditating, and I was trying to figure out what part of the Body of Christ I am. So I came up with this insight that I think I\u2019m stomach acid, I think that\u2019s my job. It\u2019s really important for metabolizing food. Yes. And it can \u2014 not \u2014 you don\u2019t need a large quantity of it. And it needs to be contained. And if it runs amok, that\u2019s called illness. But, see, it\u2019s doing\u2026 It\u2019s a great analogy for lobbying \u2014 the whole lobbying industry . Exactly, exactly. It generates energy and heat. And it does all kinds of good stuff, but it\u2019s a very specific small piece that depends on a whole system to be healthy and effective. We all have a piece of it. And we can do this. You can listen again and share this conversation with Sr. Simone Campbell through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: How to be Spiritually Bold with Sr. Simone Campbell. She\u2019s a lawyer, lobbyist, poet, and Zen contemplative best known as one of the animating faces of the \u201CNuns on the Bus.\u201D She\u2019s the executive Director of NETWORK \u2014 a Catholic lobbying organization created to represent people on the margins of society on Capitol Hill. Their mission includes \u201Cmending the wealth gap,\u201D \u201Cenacting a living wage,\u201D and \u201Ccrafting a faithful budget that benefits the 100%.\u201D I told you before we started that you always get drawn out as a political activist, and I wanted to draw you out more as a contemplative and a theological thinker. And I just wonder how you would talk in theological and spiritual terms about this challenge before us of what we so antiseptically call income inequality. Well, I think it is the chasm of our age, the challenge for us to turn around from individualism and to know that if I really know I am one with you, then that\u2019s going to affect the choices I make. And that is a spiritual practice as well as an economic practice. Pope Francis is doing a great job at making this known right now by saying that every economic decision has a moral component. And that we are all needing to work to come together in community. And what he\u2019s doing, walking towards everyone in love, is fabulous. I mean, even all these cardinals that really don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s just embracing them with love. It\u2019s wonderful. I mean it\u2019s so spiritually bold. But that\u2019s really what I think we need in our society. That would also be a different approach to politics. It\u2019s what I try to do, actually. I try \u2014 well, a couple years ago on retreat, my retreat director pushed me to realize that I did have a list that I thought \u2014 of folks that I called mistakes of God. Yeah. And folks that should have been voted off the island. It was God on an off day. But when I \u2014 I came to realize that if I was at odds with the God in them, I\u2019m at odds with the God in me. And so I need to hold compassion in my heart for Paul Ryan and \u2014 actually, he\u2019s easier. I\u2019ve gotten to know him better. We don\u2019t have to name names. Oh no. I have to name names because it\u2019s my sin. It\u2019s my sin. But John Boehner \u2014 but Boehner\u2019s trapped. I came to realize that Boehner\u2019s trapped in his desire to be Speaker and the fact that he\u2019s got two parties he\u2019s trying to lead. And it\u2019s making \u2014 he\u2019s paralyzed. And what an awful place when you\u2019ve worked all your life to get to be a leader and then you can\u2019t lead. The worst you \u2014 the best you can do is not do something. I mean, it\u2019s a horrible place. So I\u2019m trying to hold compassion in my heart for everybody. It might be easier if I was Pope. But I\u2019m not going to be Pope. But, anyway. You\u2019ve said that you think at this moment in time, we are called in the United States to develop a theology of insecurity. What does that mean? Oh, well, that started a long time ago for me because in the \u201980s I was totally enamored of liberation theology. I thought it was fabulous. It was wonderful. It fit my thing. But then I realized, \u201CHoly moly, I live in the first world. And the reason why third world Latin America needs liberation theology is because of our first world oppression.\u201D So what was our agenda? What was the theology we needed to develop? And what I \u2014 I came to this insight of I think our sin is our obsession with security. Our obsession that everything ought to work out perfectly for us. That we ought to have every conceivable drop of oil ever that we\u2019d ever need any time. That we have to have electricity, and guaranteed that I brought the right clothes, so I brought extra just in case I needed extra layers. I mean, all this obsession with having everything we need, security. And what that \u2014 oh, and then look at our response to September 11, 2001. We just went nuts with the topic. And that obsession\u2026 And then security never ever works the way we want it to. I mean\u2026 No. Because it\u2019s illusory. It never ever quite works. It\u2019s an illusion. It\u2019s an illusion. And rather, we would be better off if we made peace with insecurity. We\u2019re all vulnerable. It\u2019s all illusion. Yeah. OK, let\u2019s hear from you. Hi, what an honor to be here. So I\u2019m here tonight with some of my fellow students of female mystics. And I\u2019m wondering if you can tell us who is your favorite and why. Lovely. Oh, how could it not be Hildegard? I mean, she got excommunicated three times and then gets made a saint and the doctor of the church. I mean, really. I mean, really. I mean \u2014 and then I wonder did they really read her writings? Well, she wrote all about the feminine of God. It was fabulous. You talked about doing our part. Have you ever been doing your part and find someone else doing their part and there\u2019s a conflict between your parts? Oh, right. Yeah. But it\u2019s an important part because\u2026 No, no. Seriously, seriously. In many ways, Paul Ryan is doing his part. And I\u2019m doing my part. And we spend our lives annoying each other kind of. I mean, he enjoys sparring with me and I enjoy sparring with him. So even though we\u2019ve been working sort of on opposite sides in a way, my intersection has affected him and he\u2019s affected me. And I think we\u2019re better for it. Well, one thing that happened that was really sweet was I got to testify in front of the House Budget Committee and he \u2014 when he was chairing it last session. And one of the crazy Republicans went out after me how I shouldn\u2019t be believed because I was censured by the Vatican and so nothing was trustworthy. And Paul Ryan defended me. It was kind of sweet. He said, \u201CWell, Sister Simone is well within the teaching of the Church. You know, we may not agree on these things.\u201D That\u2019s so great. We don\u2019t hear those stories. It was kind of sweet. But it\u2019s the intersection where we have affected each other if we let ourselves be touched. That\u2019s the thing. So just do our part. \u201CWalking willing,\u201D right? \u201CWalking willing.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Sister Simone Campbell of the \u201CNuns on the Bus\u201D at our studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. Um, there\u2019s a question up here. Over the next five years, how do you see the Catholic church evolving in its role for women? Alright. Any crowd that took 350 years to figure out Galileo might be right is not noted for rapid change. So let\u2019s put it in perspective. But what is happening is that some things that people aren\u2019t hearing about \u2014 Pope Francis appointed a woman to head one of the pontifical theological schools in Rome. This was fairly earth-shattering in theological realm \u2014 those studies areas because it was always thought only boys had big enough brains to do that or something. I don\u2019t know. And so \u2014 and women have been appointed to this council that\u2019s working on the issue of abuse. Women are gradually getting more positions. But here, Pope Francis is not going to change the rules. He\u2019s trying to build peace in a church that\u2019s been so divided, so hurt, so split apart by certitude and turf, by preferring the fight as opposed to \u2014 not hearing the stories of real people and not having everybody at the table. He\u2019s trying to do the opposite. And so that, to me, is way more important than some juridical edict about women. Because it\u2019s a better building for the future, I hope. But I mean \u2014 just what you just said, as such a strong vibrant woman and a leader, I think it wouldn\u2019t make sense to a lot of, say, young American feminists. But here\u2019s the thing: my role is to be priestly in places where the Gospel wouldn\u2019t go otherwise. And if I were ordained as clerical, that all gets circumscribed by church and needs of parishes and administration and all that. Where, the freedom of what I have now is, like, huge. And it\u2019s responding \u2014 I have a chance to respond to people\u2019s hungers \u2014 I mean, I hear many confessions. I comfort many people. I have a chance to speak of the Gospel in places that would never happen otherwise. I mean, really, the Democratic National Convention. I mean, that was pretty amazing. So how could I not rejoice in this opportunity? And a lot of it\u2019s because of the Vatican naming us. So \u2014 it\u2019s their \u2014 they started it. We have a question from a student from Benilde-St. Margaret\u2019s. Hello. My name is Zeph So you talk a lot about doing our part. I want to know, like, what does that really mean? So, like, how do you know if you\u2019re doing enough or if you\u2019re doing too little? I think doing your part is the toughest as a young person because you\u2019re finding your place \u2014 you\u2019re finding your place. And so the challenge always is looking to the future. It looks dark. When I was in our formation program in the community, this one retreat guy giving us a retreat said that faith was walking through a mist with your eyes wide open. And that\u2019s what it feels like when you\u2019re trying to find your place. But then the amazing thing is to look back. It looks like it all was a straight line. You can see the straight line of light and that makes us who we are. And so I refer to the groping in the dark and that piece of listening for the nudges and paying attention, paying attention to where the nudges are. And don\u2019t procrastinate too much. Just do it. Act on it. And you\u2019ll know the right way for you forward. If you find yourself not doing anything, beginning to save yourself \u2014 \u201CI can\u2019t do that, and I can\u2019t do that\u201D \u2014 it\u2019s because you\u2019ve got too many ideas in your head. You\u2019ve got to \u2014 focus can help. At least, that\u2019s what happens to me. There\u2019s something you wrote about deep listening as a compass, which I think speaks to that. And you actually offered some questions which I just think are really great tools for all of us to hear these questions. You said, \u201CFor me, the religious life is about deep listening to the needs around us. The question becomes, \u2018Am I responding in generosity? Am I responding in selfishness? Am I responding in a way that builds up people around me, that builds me up, that is respectful of who I am?\u2019 All of those questions are at the heart of how we discern best steps forward.\u201D Yep. Thanks. Well said, eh? Well said. The \u2014 it really is that inside listening to where you\u2019re being called. And what do you \u2014 what gift do you have to offer to the situation? You could offer a bunch of lamentation, but lamentation doesn\u2019t often help. And \u2014 but what gift do you have to offer in this \u2014 to this situation? Who can you connect with? Where \u2014 what can you offer? Now, the other piece is, is we can lament a lot, but the other piece that I haven\u2019t really talked about it all and \u2014 but I goof off a lot \u2014 is joy. That joy is at the heart of this journey. And if we \u2014 too often, progressives are really grim. I mean, it\u2019s not a very good advertisement. \u201CCome join us. We\u2019re so miserable.\u201D I mean, that really isn\u2019t \u2014 because the amazing wonder is that we get to live this life in relationship. We do live in an amazing country as painful as it is with our arrogance. We get to know all kinds of people. We live in a hugely complex, multicultural setting, which is not shared in very many places in our world. There are tremendous possibilities. And I get to be here and talk with you all. I mean, that\u2019s fabulous. So the giving, the finding your niche is about life giving and enjoying the life that is given to you and to others in the process. I think that attitude takes a lot of practice, though. I feel like that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in you. You\u2019ve practiced this for a long time. Well, I have worked at \u2014 well, my experience is that God gives us gifts we need before we know we need them to respond to a situation. That\u2019s my experience over and over. Like with the bus, I had all of these colleagues in D.C., and I didn\u2019t know that I needed them until we didn\u2019t know what to do in response to the censure. And then they became gold for us, gold. And that got started because another friend had taken me to this big table meeting. And that got started because I had worked with them on Iraq. And that \u2014 so there were gifts and gifts and gifts and gifts. But sometimes when \u2014 like religious life \u2014 the big question is, will there be Women Religious in the future? I mean, we\u2019re old for the most part. We have a few new members. We\u2019re going to be smaller. It\u2019s going to be different. But I think that we\u2019re being given gifts right now for a different time. And the gifts Women Religious are being given is that we\u2019ve got deep spirituality, that we know how to live in community and fight it out, that we can listen, we can\u2019t do that \u2014 that we\u2019re having to wrestle with death and dying. And when you look at what our nation needs, it doesn\u2019t need more schools or hospitals or all that stuff. What it needs are community, spirituality, someone to listen, and dealing with death and dying. So I think the gifts that we\u2019re being given as Women Religious just need to be shared in a whole different way. And it\u2019s that puzzle about where are we being called, where is the next breakthrough moment, what\u2019s the next surprise, is being willing to use our gifts for others. One of the things you\u2019ve discovered along your journey is that you like to write poetry. And I wondered if, in closing, you would read \u201CLoaves and Fish\u201D\u2026 Oh, I love this one. \u2026 one of your poems. Yes. Can I explain the one joke in here? Yes, you may. The \u2014 OK. This is \u201CLoaves and Fish.\u201D And remember the story in Matthew \u2014 in the Gospel, and they\u2019re out in the countryside, and the Apostles say, \u201CSend them back to town, they\u2019re going to get grumpy.\u201D And Jesus says, \u201CFeed them yourselves.\u201D And the Apostles say, \u201Cwe don\u2019t have it.\u201D Well, at the end of Matthew\u2019s account, he says, \u201C5,000 men were fed to say nothing of the women and children.\u201D Well, now that made me mad. So I meditated about that. As you can tell, I have an odd spiritual life. So I thought about it, and I realized they only counted the ones who thought it was a miracle. Because the women had brought food from home. They shared it. But the guys \u2014 I mean, don\u2019t you have this \u2014 don\u2019t you experience this all the time? Guys will show up. There\u2019s food on the table. \u201CWow, food. What a miracle. Isn\u2019t that great? It was like elves produced it.\u201D So, anyway. OK. Now that you know that, you\u2019ll know the line. OK. OK, \u201CLoaves and Fish:\u201D \u201CI always joked that the miracle of loaves and fish was sharing, The women always knew this. But in this moment of need and notoriety, I ache, tremble, almost weep at folks so hungry, malnourished, faced with spiritual famine of epic proportions. My heart aches with their need. Apostle-like, I whine, what are we among so many? The consistent 2,000-year-old ever-new response is this: Blessed and broken, you are enough. I savor the blessed, cower at the broken, and pray to be enough.\u201D Thank you. Thank you for coming. Sr. Simone Campbell is the Executive Director of NETWORK.
