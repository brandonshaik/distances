  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CTV and Parables of Our Time\u201D with Diane Winston, a journalist and scholar of media and religion at USC. We\u2019ll explore how shows like Lost, The Wire, and Battlestar Galactica are engaging grand themes of ethics and humanity and helping a new generation tell the story of our time. I think we underestimate the power of entertainment narratives to influence the way we look at the world. And storytelling, when it\u2019s good storytelling, you know, orients us to possibilities and helps us structure the way we look at things. Last week most of us were strangers and god knows how long we\u2019re going to be here. But if we can\u2019t live together we\u2019re going to die alone. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Your favorite TV show, once a finite experience, now has eternal life online and college students gather ritually to watch programs like Lost, captivated by its craft but also by the mystery at its core. I\u2019ll confess that I too am a Lostaficionado. We\u2019ll listen in on it this hour along with The Wire, House, and another of my favorites, Battlestar Galactica. We\u2019ll entertain the notion of my guest, Diane Winston that television has gained in vitality as a center of storytelling in post-September 11th America and that a new generation of programs is engaging grand confusions of ethics, identity, and destiny in modern life. So despite what your mother told you, TV might be good for you. From American Public Media this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, \u201CTV and Parables of Our Time.\u201D Like everything else in life, the whole truth about television is complicated. Prime time is filling up with reality TV that surely says something about our collective soul, but there have always been shows that enlarged our imaginations and enriched our cultural narrative. There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man \u2026 And cable TV has given rise to series like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under which have taken root in some of us more like good books than prime time TV of old. Granted, even artistic TV, like all art, is a matter of taste, but if you\u2019ve thought of the new Battlestar Galactica, for example, as just another cheesy sci-fi action show, listen to this scene from the final season. The series traces an epic encounter between humans and human-made, human-like machines through war, peace, and everything in between. In our Civil War we\u2019ve seen death. We watched our people die, gone forever. As terrible as it was, beyond the reach of the resurrection ships something began to change. We could feel a sense of time, as if each moment held its own significance. We began to realize that for our existence to hold any value, it must end. To live meaningful lives we must die and not return. The one human flaw that you spend your lifetimes distressing over, mortality, is the one thing \u2014 well, it\u2019s the one thing that makes you whole. My guest this hour, Diane Winston, holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion at the Annenberg School for Communication at USC. She\u2019s reported for major newspapers and now blogs and writes widely about the intersection of religion and media in many aspects of modern life. Her classes at USC include: Religion, Media, and Hollywood, Faith and TV. She\u2019s recently edited a book of scholarly essays called Small Screen, Big Picture: Television and Lived Religion. Diane and I have known each other as colleagues for several years and have even watched some television together. As we began this conversation about TV\u2019s power in our culture now, I wondered about the formative programs of her early life. Well, it\u2019s funny insofar as our choices were so restricted. I know. You know, especially given what our kids can watch today. I think when I was really young it was \u201CThe Mickey Mouse Club\u201D and the Mousketeers gave me a really good sense of virtues. And I could identify with all of them, though I never liked Annette very much. When I was older, I don\u2019t know if I had any programs that I loved growing up \u2014 did you? Well, you know what I think of immediately are programs like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeanie and then if I try to think about the messages those shows were sending \u2014 right? I mean, they were communicating something about the world we were inhabiting or trying to inhabit, the roles of women, for example. Right. Right. Right. Because all those shows sort of gave us an idea of women not being very empowered, to use today\u2019s words, but they were always very crafty. Yes. I mean, whether or not they were witches they still worked a certain magic to get what they wanted. So there\u2019s been plenty of people writing recently about a kind of renaissance that\u2019s happening in television. I mean, I attribute and I think other people do too, some of it to HBO, to these cable networks creating a very high level of artistry in shows like Six Feet Under, you know, acting, writing, and that somehow that\u2019s raised the bar for everyone else. I would say we\u2019re in a Golden Age of television. Yeah. And it\u2019s partly a result of the media breakthroughs. Because of digitization we have so many options and more stations can do niche programming so you don\u2019t have to appeal to the lowest common denominator. You can do a program that gets two million people and it can be like, Damages or Battlestar. Yeah. But also, HBO did raise the bar and I think it also has to do with the times we live in. I think we live in very difficult times and 2001 crystallized that for a lot of people. And I think hard times brings out our need for stories and writers respond to that. And, interestingly, as I\u2019ve been teaching this class on religion and TV, a lot of TV writers say, \u201CWe don\u2019t want to work in film anymore. We want to work in television, because that\u2019s where we can really tell our stories.\u201D That\u2019s really interesting and it\u2019s about more than the advance in technology. I mean, if you look at, let\u2019s say even the difference between versions of the same shows, like the old Battlestar Galactica and the new Battlestar Galactica or those programs you and I were talking about from our children, I Dream of Jeanie or Bewitchedcompared to, I don\u2019t know, anything \u2014 Lost. Again, kind of the care in the writing, the seriousness of it. Right. Even when it\u2019s very entertaining, the seriousness of it. Well, wouldn\u2019t you compare Bewitched to \u201CBuffy\u201D? I guess so. Yeah. I mean, you know, women with supernatural powers but whereas Samantha was kind of just redirecting her household, Buffy was out saving the world. Right. Something else you point out \u2014 that in shows like House or \u201CER\u201D or Grey\u2019s Anatomy, which I\u2019ll confess I\u2019m not really a medical show person, but I know this is true, that they really take on these issues of medical ethics and technology, but which are also very big human questions. Who should live, who should die, who controls the technology that makes either possible. Mm-hmm. Well, it\u2019s interesting because David Shore, the creator of House, came to my class and he basically said, well, first of all he has two older twin brothers who are Orthodox Rabbis in Israel. So religion is not a strange subject to him. He is not particularly religious but he said that each show has an ethical problem at its center and he feels strongly that they present ways for the public to think about issues. He says no more tests. He wants to die and he wants us to help him do it. And I want to play a little game I call \u2018block my spike with Misty May.\u2019 He\u2019s thought this through. It\u2019s not an impulsive decision. Neither is mine. He\u2019s depressed. He\u2019ll feel much better after we cure him. He\u2019s seen all the tests we\u2019ve seen. Even if we figure out what\u2019s causing the lung damage it\u2019s too late to reverse it. You can\u2019t know that without knowing what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s his call. So what do we do? We just put a plastic bag over his head and get it over with? No. We give him a syringe full of morphine. Every doctor I\u2019ve ever practiced with has done it. They don\u2019t want to. They don\u2019t like to. But that\u2019s the way it is. I haven\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t do it either. You just said we should respect his decision. Respect it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we honor it. Right. It just means we talk about it. At some point \u2018do no harm\u2019 has to mean allowing nature to take its course, not stubbornly standing in the way of it. Sticking a metal syringe into a plastic IV line and pumping in a lethal dose of morphine is not letting nature take its course, not according to the state of New Jersey. Certainly a lot of interesting things to consider. Stress EKG rules out the heart, which means something\u2019s got to be attacking his lungs, might go plasma or strep pneumo, which probably means it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. We could try levofloxacin. Coming up with a new treatment isn\u2019t going to do us any good unless we convince him it\u2019s worth trying. Come on. He\u2019s old and sick and tiny. We can do whatever we want to him. I\u2019m not saying that TV is going to replace great literature and I\u2019m not saying TV is going to replace scripture, but it is a site where people are asking very basic questions about the meaning of life and where they fit in and how to behave as good people. A lot of that\u2019s done online now which is also a new development which is really interesting that fan sites, fan fiction, fan videotapes, fans putting in new narratives for characters, I mean, the whole dynamics of television watching is changing because people can become producers as well as receivers \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 of the content. It\u2019s sort of mind blowing. It is. So I want to talk about this from a few different angles, but if I ask what is on or what has been on in this post 9/11 period, maybe let\u2019s focus on that, that you think of as most explicitly having religious themes, what comes to mind? Well, as I look at 9/11 I think that there are a lot of ways to, you know, slice and dice the issues that have come out of it. So, for example, one issue is mortality and what do we do after we die. Right. And I think there\u2019s been a number or shows that have dealt with that. You know, a lot of them haven\u2019t been on for more than a season or two, but everything from Medium to Ghost Whisperer to the vampire shows to The Reaper, I think all those shows speak to our fear of death and our hope that something lies beyond. So that\u2019s one aspect of it. Then I think that 9/11 also skewed our ideas of morality and what we look for in a hero. And I think shows like Rescue Me, The Shield, 24, House, all speak to that. The hero is sort of an anti-hero and someone who we can depend upon, but not necessarily like very much. Right. And \u201CDexter\u201D is a great example of that too. I mean, you know, are these people good? Are they evil? Are those terms not even appropriate? Then I think there\u2019s shows that just sort of say nothing is what you think it is and Lost is a great example of that. Even \u201CWest Wing\u201D did that by presenting an alternative universe where we had a President who was thoughtful about religion and politics in a very different way than the real President was. And The Sopranos, another great example of \u2018what\u2019s moral?\u2019 What is it to lead a good life? Is caring for your family enough? And how do you live? You know, what decisions constitute being part of a community and Tony was a very good member of some communities, but a wretched member of others. Right. So I think all those shows dealt with various aspects of 9/11 and the questions that it raised for us. And The Wire. I mean, that\u2019s another great example. The Wire doesn\u2019t have religious themes or spiritual themes in the same way that some of these others do, but I think it brought us back to questions of what is our responsibility to our neighbors? And how do we show compassion and concern in a very compromised, gray world. I haven\u2019t been able to get into The Wire, although I\u2019ve tried. But I also sense that it taps into a real and reasonable anxiety that we have about the complexity of our cities \u2014 life in our cities and that what is happening in Baltimore is also happening in Los Angeles and Minneapolis. It deals with issues of race and class in a way that no other show I\u2019ve ever seen does. You know, everyone applauded \u201CGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201D for having a colorblind cast and it\u2019s true. It\u2019s very admirable. But The Wire shows us urban life in ways that no other show ever has ever done before and makes us feel responsible for what\u2019s going on. Journalist and scholar of media and religion, Diane Winston. Set in Baltimore, HBO series The Wire explores life in a dying American city where the drug trade rules the street and civic institutions are broken. The drama was broadcast for five seasons. It began with the tale of drug dealers and cops and the failed war on drugs, then expanded to reveal other layers of the urban ecosystem, from City Hall to the public schools to the media. In this scene, a retired police major and a university researcher lobby an official from the Department of Education to support an experimental classroom for disruptive middle school students. How\u2019d they do? Pretty well, considering. Did they embarrass us? Us? No. We\u2019re fine with it but, I mean, they were intimidated, embarrassed, and awkward as hell, but they made it through. Ms. Shepherdson, these aren\u2019t the kids that are going to be able to sit still for the statewide test, much less do well on them. These were the kids that are going to make it impossible for anyone else to do well. So we\u2019re writing them off? No. That\u2019s what we\u2019re not doing. You\u2019re not educating them. You\u2019re socializing them. They weren\u2019t being educated before. There\u2019s no point in being obtuse. Excuse me. Hold on. Hold on. Look, what he\u2019s saying is this. I mean, you put a text book in front of these kids, put a problem on a blackboard or teach them every problem in some statewide test, it won\u2019t matter. None of it. Because they\u2019re not learning for our world. They\u2019re learning for theirs. And they know exactly what it is they\u2019re training for and what is it everyone expects them to be. I expect them to be students. But it\u2019s not about you or us, or the tests or the system. It\u2019s what they expect of themselves. I mean, every single one of them know they headed back to the corners. Their brothers and sisters, their parents, they came through these same classrooms, didn\u2019t they? We pretended to teach them. They pretended to learn. Where\u2019d they end up? Same damn corners. I mean, Jesus, they see right through us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CTV and Parables of Our Time\u201D with Diane Winston, a scholar of media and religion at USC. We\u2019re exploring how a new generation of television is engaging grand ethical and spiritual questions in a new generation of viewers. Something that, you know, I\u2019ve been quite aware of in these same post 9/11 years, and I don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with 9/11, but that spiritual but not religious doesn\u2019t mean the same thing as it did, say, in the \u201980s or \u201990s where there was a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, the stereotype was a shallowness, right, of pick and choose. Mm-hmm. But there\u2019s a real depth to the way people are asking \u2014 or I encounter this \u2014 these spiritual, moral, ethical questions either inside religion or outside them and what you\u2019re describing is that reflected in these television narratives. I think that\u2019s a good point. One of the fastest growing segments in the American scene are people who aren\u2019t affiliated and who say that they\u2019re none \u2014 N-O-N-E. But that does not mean that they aren\u2019t asking these questions: Why am I here? What am I doing? Who\u2019s important to me? Why does it matter? What\u2019s going to happen to me after I die? These are basic human questions. So, you know, whether you\u2019re spiritual or religious or agnostic or atheist, at some level you have to answer them to get out of bed every morning. Money may be your god or sex or drugs, but you still have to, I think, find a way to commit your life to something. And some TV writers, like some novelists and filmmakers, wrestle with these issues and have come up with narratives to help us think through them. Right. So in Lost, for example, there are religious overtones and there are characters who have religious experiences, but to me what is so spiritually engaging about that show is its this very multi-layered examination of precisely I think what you described as core spiritual questions \u2014 what does it mean to be human? \u2014 and these people in this extreme situation who confront themselves. But with all the \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ll just say this because everybody doesn\u2019t watch Lost and I discovered it just recently, but you get to know these characters in the extreme situation but you also come over time to know a lot about their previous lives and eventually you know something about their future lives. But they all are terribly flawed, as we all are, and there are themes of brokenness and redemption. I always think of the first line of Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s The Nature and Destiny of Man, \u201CMan is his own most vexing problem.\u201D Right? I mean, like, and the characters on Lost you see that come to life narratively with each one of them week after week. But you also see this very noble human will to keep learning and to me that\u2019s absolutely spiritually evocative television. Yes. I think those characters on Lost, like the characters in Battlestar are addressing a fundamental question which is \u201CHow do I get home?\u201D Right. Right. And what is the meaning of home? And what is the meaning of home? And that\u2019s the question of The Odyssey, it\u2019s the question of the Exodus story, it\u2019s the question of the Wizard of Oz. I think it\u2019s a question that all of us have and that\u2019s why those characters are so appealing to us, because they mirror some of our questions about it. And so I could imagine, like, if I had never watched Lost or even if I had and not liked it, I could hear us talking here on the radio and think, \u201CThey are just making this up.\u201D So I just want to \u2014 I think I found this in your work. This is one of the show\u2019s creators, Damon Lindelof. Yeah. And he said, \u201CThis show is about people who are metaphorically lost in their lives, who get on an airplane and crash on an island and become physically lost on the planet Earth and once they are able to metaphorically find themselves again they will be able to physically find themselves in the world again.\u201D And we don\u2019t imagine our television writers having those kinds of intentions, I don\u2019t think. Well, the other thing is not only did they have those intentions, but the fact is thousands and thousands of fans are online yakking about this show. So it obviously is not just our mishegoss, that we\u2019re creating something out of nothing. A lot of people find themes and ideas on Lost that really get their juices going. Right. And as a student of popular culture that sort of makes me curious. What is it about this show that makes people want to live in this universe? The Lostuniverse, that is. ABC\u2019s Lost is set to end in its sixth season in 2010. Part survival tale, part science fiction, Lost revolves around the winding fate of a handful of travelers from Sydney to Los Angeles who crash on an island with mysterious time-bending properties. In this scene from the first season, one of the characters, a physician Jack Shephard, addresses the plane survivors as it becomes clear that they are not going to be rescued any time soon. It\u2019s been six days and we\u2019re all still waiting. Waiting for someone to come. Well, what if they don\u2019t? We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning just going for a swim. And he tried to save her and now you\u2019re about to crucify him? Last week most of us were strangers, but we\u2019re all here now, and god knows how long we\u2019re going to be here. But if we can\u2019t live together we\u2019re going to die alone. This evocative scene from Lost and many other television series sparked hours of conversation among my producers and me about resonant themes in the TV shows we watch and we\u2019d like to hear about shows or characters that stick with you.

Look for links to share your story on our home page speakingoffaith.org. After a short break, moral and political meaning in Battlestar Galactica. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CTV and Parables of Our Time.\u201D My guest is Diane Winston, who holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California. Her classes at USC include: Religion, Media, and Hollywood, Faith and TV. And she\u2019s edited a recent book of essays, Small Screen, Big Picture: Television and Lived Religion. We\u2019re exploring her sense that the confusions of the post 9/11 era have intensified television\u2019s role as a center of storytelling in American life and that with a narrative canvas stretching from the inner city to outer space, shows like The Wire, Lost, and Battlestar Galactica are helping us probe the depths of the story of our time. I do love science fiction, generally, but I wasn\u2019t that interested in Battlestar Galactica even after I was hearing about it until a Muslim theologian said to me, \u201CYou have to watch Battlestar Galactica. It\u2019s about everything that\u2019s happening in the world. It\u2019s about Israel, Palestine, it\u2019s about the post 9/11 world.\u201D And I was completely intrigued. And what did you think when you watched it? Well, I think it is about that, but actually, I mean, there\u2019s so much going on there that \u2014 there\u2019s so many layers that are also that big to me. You know, the \u2014 again, this huge question of what it means to be human, because of the confrontation with the cylons who are creations of humans. Right. It\u2019s interesting, because that show \u2014 I had the same initial reaction as you did. I love science fiction, but I just didn\u2019t want to go there. I mean, the name itself is a problem. Battlestar. Yeah. Right. Right. Come on. We\u2019re girls. We watch Project Runway. Right. Exactly. Yeah. My daughter watches Project Runway. And when I first watched it I wasn\u2019t even sure I liked it, because it looked so different than anything else I was watching. So I kind of then forced myself to watch it for a while until I could get into it. And I joined it midway season one. But having said that, I agree with you. I think that this show really speaks to this era and at some point in time, you know, I think some of these television shows are going to be classics that people return to like they return to good books. And I\u2019m not sure whether this will hold up as art, but it will definitely hold up as a reflection of what people cared about and what the social narratives were about this post 9/11 period. And the fact that they have turned so much of our anxiety and angst into good drama, I think, is what makes the show so compelling to the folks who watch it. And whether it is terrorism and torture, whether it is the search for a home or the question of who is a person, all those issues were embodied in dramatic form. The Sci Fi Channel series Battlestar Galactica centers around a world very much like Earth populated by human beings. Their planet is destroyed by a race of machines, the cylons, who were created to serve humans and then were banished into space after they rebelled. Half a century later they have evolved to match human intelligence and also to inhabit human-like bodies. Yet there are violent divisions among the cylons, like the one speaking in this scene, over whether this is progress. In all your travels have you ever seen a star supernova? No. No? Well, I have. I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the universe: other stars, other planets, and eventually other life. A supernova. Creation itself. I was there. I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull. With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum. With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air. The five of us designed you to be as human as possible. I don\u2019t want to be human. I want to see gamma rays. I want to hear x-rays. And I want to smell dark matter. Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can\u2019t even express these things properly because I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language. But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws and feel the solar wind of a supernova flowing over me. I\u2019m a machine. And I could know much more. I could experience so much more. But I\u2019m trapped in this absurd body. And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way. You know, I was thinking of a conversation I had years ago with an Israeli who said that he felt it had been so important for the Israelis that one thing had changed that made Oslo possible was that Israelis had started to become survivors rather than victims. And, I mean, I think that\u2019s just this ongoing struggle on both sides of that conflict. Mm-hmm. And something that really strikes me if I watch both Battlestar Galactica and Lost is that you see those characters grow from victims to survivors. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s a theme I\u2019ve heard in conversations I\u2019ve had with people about conflict all over the world. Right. And the interesting thing is, is can we take this in better as entertainment than as news? Right. If we read another article in Newsweek about Israeli and Palestinian children at a summer camp getting along is that going to make us believe that change is possible? Or maybe you need that and you need shows like Battlestar Galacticaand Lost to show you that change is possible. Right. I guess that I think we underestimate the power of entertainment narratives to influence the way we look at the world and I think storytelling, when it\u2019s good storytelling, you know, orients us to possibilities and helps us structure the way we look at things. So the power of the narrative is that it takes on a life of its own for folks. But I don\u2019t know. Maybe if Ronald D. Moore took over the UN we\u2019d all be getting along better. You think? Well, he\u2019s the producer of Battlestar, right? Right. Did you have him teach at your class? Yes. He came to our class. Was there anything about that that surprised you or continued to inform your thinking about that show as being more than just another television show? I think what he says that\u2019s helpful is he talks about his own Catholic upbringing and although that\u2019s not tremendously formative for the show per se, I think that it made him open and receptive to using religion as a driving force through the show. What stayed with me most was the fact that he cared passionately about what was going on in the world and he was looking for ways to find dramatic outlets for it. So when Abu Graihb was in the news he talked about how his writers sat down and discussed how they could somehow echo that in the show. Right. And they did. Yeah. So that intentionality of looking at the world and then trying to step back from it, presented in an unfamiliar context so that we might think about our situation in new ways seem to suffuse his idea of what the artist\u2019s task was about and I think that stuck by me. I thought he had a lot of integrity about that. Here is a scene from Battlestar Galactica that was written in the wake of the Abu Graihb scandal. As the humans are more threatened by cylon opponents who have also infiltrated their society, their treatment of captured cylons becomes more brutal. In this scene the human President Laura Roslin interrupts an interrogation involving a technique suggestive of waterboarding. Do it. What the hell is going on here? What exactly is it that you are doing here? It\u2019s a machine, sir. There\u2019s no limit to the tactics I can use. And where\u2019s the warhead? I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know. You spent the last eight hours torturing this man, this machine, whatever it is, and you don\u2019t have a single piece of information to show for it? When Battlestar Galactica\u2018s Executive Producer, Ronald D. Moore spoke to Diane Winston\u2019s class in early 2007, he talked about the influence of September 11th and the \u2018war on terror\u2019 in creating the new Battlestar Galactica. He recalled how theological ideas from the Mormon faith and Greco-Roman polytheism influenced its writing. You can watch a video of his talk through SOF Observed, our staff blog, at speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Pubic Media. Today, \u201CTV and Parables of Our Time\u201D with Diane Winston, a journalist and scholar of religion and media at USC. We\u2019re exploring how a new generation of programs is engaging grand questions of ethics, identity, and destiny both on television and in enduring lifespans online. I was talking to a meeting of evangelical media folks recently and we were discussing the benefits of different new technologies to get the word out and it just struck me when I was discussing that with them was, you know, the Passover Seder and how low-tech that is and yet how formative that has been. Yeah. Right. \u2026 in Judaism and keeping the Jewish people together. How incredibly enduring. Right. I mean, it is a great story and, you know, yes, you can Twitter it or you can do it in Second Life and you can jazz it up but you don\u2019t need to because the story itself is so good. And when we say it, we say this did not happen to them; it happened to us. Right. Right. So it\u2019s telling a good story and then it\u2019s making you part of the tale. Which is what happens online. Right. People become part of the story. And then they tell it forward. Right. Right. Right. And craft it. So I think we have a sense, and you certainly are more steeped in this than I am, that this means something. That these stories and this kind of drama is making some kind of impression. The one thing that did occur to me in this context was I remember something right as Barack Obama was elected President. Someone wrote an article that said, \u201CBlack Presidents We Have Known.\u201D Did you see that? And it was \u2026 Yeah. It was people like \u2014 it was David Palmer from 24 and the point was made that alongside parallel to all of the other ways in which our culture prepared itself to make that leap, that this was one ingredient perhaps. And I think of Laura Roslin, who was the President on Battlestar Galactica. So, I mean, I wonder if there might be lines to trace like that on some of these themes which would be, actually, if you think about the themes of Battlestar Galactica, very hopeful. Yes. It would be hopeful. And what you\u2019re talking about, actually there is a study at one of the Midwestern universities of gay characters on television and what they found out was that shows like \u201CWill and Grace\u201D really did normalize for many people gay relationships. And so the old conservative fear that the liberal media is going to ruin society had some credence in that sense. OK. All right. All right. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just speculative. I think it\u2019s actually true that differences become normalized through media and the unimaginable becomes possible that way. Now it\u2019s one thing to think about character representations in a black President or a gay best friend. It seems harder to leap to brotherhood and world peace. But I don\u2019t think you get there unless you begin telling the stories and the stories begin sounding normal. Right. I mean, I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s nothing that we might see in a day or even our lifetimes, but I think the more you tell certain stories the more possible and plausible they become and the more you can move towards accomplishing them. And I think this is a related question, actually. I wondered how you \u2014 what kind of perspective you have from USC, Los Angeles about a generational aspect to this, how new generations may in fact be shaping the kind of television that\u2019s being made or taking it in differently and also just some of the themes. I mean, it occurs to me this theme of \u2018otherness,\u2019 of encountering the other, of having to share the world with the other whether you want to or not, it\u2019s just a reality in the 21st century. Mm-hmm. And certainly in a place like Los Angeles. So, I don\u2019t know, what do you think about that? Well, my students, I think, take my class because they actually feel it\u2019s going to be very subversive. They can tell their parents they\u2019re taking a class on TV and getting credit. Right. Or else they think it must be really easy. But I found that, by and large, most of them have never thought about television in this way and it\u2019s mind boggling to them to think of TV of something which isn\u2019t a forbidden pleasure. But once they began looking at it through this light all of a sudden it clicks and whether we talk about the ethical conundrums of House or the portrayals of religious, political fundamentalism in Battlestar Galactica, which is always a hard sell in my classes \u2026 Right. \u2026 they see it once we discuss it. And the other part of this that we haven\u2019t really talked about is how television itself becomes a religious act, a ritual act. You know, a lot of them get together once a week and they watch their favorite shows. And there may not be anything else that they get together once a week to do. Right. And then they talk about them. And so I\u2019d love to be there for those conversations and I was always curious about once someone takes my class and they get together for the conversation is the discussion at all shaped by what they\u2019re doing in class. But you\u2019re right, they look at things a little differently then we may have. Some of the ideas about the other are not as fixed and formulated and they\u2019re more open to difference. Right. And once they\u2019re given permission they\u2019re very willing to read spiritual and religious subtexts into the material. I want to ask you about something Phyllis Tickle said to me about six or seven years ago. We were talking about movies \u2014 and this is something that I also observed and I think is probably also behind what you said a minute ago about how these students are quite happy to think about spiritual and religious subtext \u2014 she said this generation is fascinated with mystery, as human beings have been, but maybe we lost that a bit for a few generations. And she felt that the Internet and that this online reality was actually opening peoples\u2019 imaginations about that and changing it. She said every time one of these kids logs on they step through the back of the closet into Narnia. And they live with ideas of different levels of reality. There\u2019s virtual reality and this reality, and that they all have some substance, and that they don\u2019t have a cognitive dissidence taking all of that seriously. I wonder just how you react to that idea. Well, I wish I had thought of it. Well, it stayed with me. I can see why. That\u2019s really \u2014 that\u2019s great. That\u2019s great. And I think it really does explain why Lost in particular is so popular with this generation. I would\u2019ve never watched Lost and my step-daughters who are in their 20s came over once with the DVD and made me sit down and watch it with them. But, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s like a whole kind of willing suspension of disbelief that they\u2019re more accustomed to probably, because of the way they consume media. You know, media is so interesting, because your orientation to it really shapes the way you see the world around you. And so, for instance, a lot of people say because of the invention of the printing press Protestantism was able to get a foothold and spread rapidly, because people were able to get the books and read for themselves and the idea of individualism came out of that. And you can see that there\u2019s another shift in consciousness in the way we understand ourselves going on with the creation of the Internet and what Phyllis said gets to that. The fact that it\u2019s not linear. It\u2019s individualistic in one sense, but you\u2019re quickly part of a larger community. It\u2019s just a whole way of thinking about things that re-enchants the world. Which is something TV scholars of religion and media, or people who study religion and media, are thinking a lot about. How do we re-enchant things? Capitalism and industrial capitalism sort of bleached out the world, put us all in what Weber calls iron cages, and how do we make things magic again? And television does some of that. Lost makes it magic. But so does the Internet in the way it can not only passively watch Lost, but we can make up our own stories about it and share them with each other. Diane Winston holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. She\u2019s the editor of Small Screen, Big Picture: Television and Lived Religion. Her media and religion blog is called \u201CThe Scoop.\u201D Here in closing another scene from Lost. The character John Locke is speaking to Jack Shephard. I\u2019m an ordinary man, Jack, meat and potatoes. I live in the real world. I\u2019m not a big believer in magic, but this place is different. It\u2019s special. The others don\u2019t want to talk about it, because it scares them, but we all know it. We all feel it. Is your white rabbit a hallucination? Probably. But what if everything that happened here happened for a reason? What if this person that you\u2019re chasing is really here? That\u2019s impossible. Even if it is, let\u2019s say it\u2019s not. Then what happens when I catch him? I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve looked into the eye of this island and what I saw was beautiful. To fit all these television clips and Diane Winston into this hour of radio we had to cut substantial sections from my conversation with her, including her ideas about the double-edged sword of moral messages from the controversial television drama 24 and what distinguished older programs like The Twilight Zone and \u201CThe Brady Bunch.\u201D But you can download an mp3 of our entire unedited conversation and this radio program on our website speakingoffaith.org. There you\u2019ll also find my intriguing conversation with writer Phyllis Tickle that I referenced to Diane Winston. It was part of a 2004 program called \u201CA Return to the Mystery\u201D and includes discussion of and audio from the Harry Potter, Matrix and Star Wars movies. On another note, over the next few months, looking forward to Ramadan, we\u2019re inviting Muslim listeners to illustrate the complexity and diversity of the Muslim world, as it is often called, with your voices and stories.
