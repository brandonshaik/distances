  "fullText": "We inhabit a strange, tumultuous political moment. Today, with David Brooks and E.J. Dionne, we step back from what happened yesterday or in the last 20 minutes. We take public theology as a lens on the larger moral dynamics we will all be reckoning with as citizens, whatever happens on November 8. Brooks and Dionne are renowned as journalists, authors, and commentators for The New York Timesand The Washington Post respectively \u2014 and they\u2019re known together as liberal vs. conservative sparring partners on public media. It\u2019s a treat to draw them out reflectively and in depth. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with David Brooks and E.J. Dionne before a live audience at Graham Chapel at Washington University in St. Louis. We were convened by the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics the day before the second presidential debate. The three of us were actually together the last time at Georgetown at the Berkeley Center in 2009. Was it right after the inauguration? I think it was maybe February. I meant to look that up. So this was the aftermath of two terms of a president who had held conservative evangelical Christianity as a primary aspect of his political identity. It was the beginning of the first term of a president, Barack Obama, who had declared that his favorite philosopher was the public theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. What a difference seven years makes. And as the three of us discussed all those years ago, the religious enterprise at its deepest is about what binds us together. And theology is as much a sophisticated conversation across time and generations, a sophisticated analysis of the human condition as much as it is a conversation about God. And each of you, in your own way, and I would say increasingly in these years since 2009, has become one of our most searching American thinkers who very often routinely brings theology \u2014 and by that I mean religious questions, religious wisdom, voices of religious wisdom, if not necessarily religious teachings \u2014 into your reflection on political realities. And you\u2019ve each, in your writings, described this as a kind of evolution. So I wondered if we could start by each of you just saying something about that evolution and what it has emerged to as you\u2019ve responded to political life, our American political culture. E.J., you were raised by a conservative father to be a conservative, and my understanding is that you really returned to taking Catholic tradition seriously as you discovered the social teachings of Catholic tradition. I always say that I became a liberal because I\u2019m Catholic. And in my book Why the Right Went Wrong, I talk about my dad. And we had a running dialogue. My dad died when I was 16, and we spent our time arguing and loving to argue. He gave me a subscription to the New Republic when I was 13 to strengthen my side of the argument. I asked him, and he thought it would be good for me. So I was really blessed to have a dad who thought it was good that his kid argued with him. And he ended up training me for what I did for a living. Two things happened to me to begin to change my politics. One is \u2014 I actually was 12 or 13 and started looking at what the Great Society was doing, and I said, \u201CThese guys are actually trying to solve a series of problems that the society has. Why aren\u2019t we solving them? Why aren\u2019t we conservatives doing that?\u201D So I became the most boring thing a teenager can be; I became a liberal Republican. And then over time, I decided that didn\u2019t work anymore, but I thought there was an obligation. LBJ had identified a series of problems that really did need to be solved, and so that was the first step. And the second step was\u00A0we are joined as well by Benedictines because I went to a Benedictine high school. And in a religion class, we could pick any book we wanted to read for that class and write a report on it, and I chose Martin Luther King\u2019s Strength to Love, that great collection of his sermons. And that book began a real transformation in me. I saw things I hadn\u2019t seen before. And so that was the beginning of my journey. Then when I was in college, I too was influenced by Dorothy Day, the Berrigan brothers, and a whole tradition that was actually much more radical than I was. I\u2019ve always been uncomfortable when some of my fellow liberals talked about completely separating religion from politics. The late Jean Elshtain said, \u201CSeparation of church and state is one thing. Separation of religion and politics is something else.\u201D And for me, they were inseparable in the way I thought. I once debated Ralph Reed, and I said, \u201CI will always defend Ralph\u2019s right to base his political conclusions on his religious conclusions, but I do want to ask him where Jesus endorses a cut in the capital gains tax because I just couldn\u2019t find it in my Scripture.\u201D Galatians. Galatians 23. I think it\u2019s in Philippians. You could do \u201CThe Parable of the Talents.\u201D I\u2019ve thought about that. But we will leave it at that. And David, you are Jewish, and you were raised Jewish. You\u2019ve lately taken to quoting Saint Augustine with great fervor. And you\u2019ve spoken and written about really loving reading theology as you were writing The Road to Character. Talk about that. Yeah. At first, I didn\u2019t know E.J. went through a youthful liberal Republican phase. It\u2019s pathetic in your 50s. In your 20s, it\u2019s just tragic. That\u2019s the second-worst thing David ever said about me. The worst thing David ever said about me is that I was the only person he ever met whose eyes light up at the words \u201Cpanel discussion.\u201D That\u2019s mean. I guess the reason I went into \u2014 when you write a column, one of the things you learn is to be narcissistic, and you learn to explore your stuff in public. So I think, since we met, I\u2019ve become much more religiously inclined. And that\u2019s, I think, for three things. First, for an awareness of one\u2019s moral mediocrity. For example, you meet these people who radiate an inner light. And I was in Frederick, Maryland, I don\u2019t know how many years ago, and I ran into these ladies. There were probably 30 of them, aged 50 to 80, who teach immigrants English and then how to read it. And I walk into the room, and they just radiate patience and goodness, Dorothy Day directness, just that calmness. They didn\u2019t know me from Adam, but they made me feel funnier and smarter and special, and they just had that \u2014 they radiated that light. I remember thinking, \u201CI\u2019ve achieved way more career success than I ever thought I would, but I don\u2019t have that.\u201D Second, would be the experience of grace. And the story I tell about that \u2014 these are just exemplar stories, but I have a million of them. I was driving home from the NewsHourabout 10 years ago, and I pull into my driveway, and it\u2019s 7:30 at night, but it\u2019s summer, so it\u2019s still light out. My kids, who are then 12, 9, and 4, were in the backyard kicking a supermarket ball up in the air. And they were running across the yard, chasing down this ball, tumbling all over each other, laughing, giggling, sort of shouting with joy. And I pull up into the driveway, and I see into the backyard. I get confronted with this tableau of perfect family happiness. And the sun is coming through the trees, my lawn for some reason looks perfect\u2026 \u2026and so I just sit there staring at it through the windshield. And it\u2019s one of those moments where reality sort of spills outside its boundaries, and time and life are sort of suspended, and you become aware of a happiness that you don\u2019t deserve, which is grace. When that happens, your soul swells up a little, and you want to be worthy of that happiness. And it\u2019s just a moment when the soul is swelling. So that was another step. And then lately \u2014 one experience is love, deep love. And the nice thing \u2014 Christian Wiman, who is a poet I\u2019ve quoted in your presence before says, \u201CLove is always on the move. It\u2019s never content to just love one thing.\u201D So you want to love the person, you want to love \u2014 but then your flesh sort of gets opened up, exposing soft flesh below, and you realize your riches are not in yourself, and that sort of desire and even awareness of a fusion at that deep level sort of changes your view. So when you go through these experiences, theology begins to make sense because it speaks spiritually, emotionally, and morally. So it\u2019s not like I read it because I\u2019m suddenly \u2014 well, it\u2019s not an academic enterprise; it\u2019s the way to see the world. And so it\u2019s become an explanatory tool as much as anything else. That\u2019s so beautiful, and it makes me not want to talk about the election, which is what I had planned to do next. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, with journalists David Brooks and E.J. Dionne. I think we have to, but let\u2019s be quick. It\u2019s notable, I think, that religion has played a very small overt role in this election relative to the last 30 or 40 years. And also in this campaign, like with Obama, and especially the last campaign, reversing this trend of decades, the candidate most articulate about her religious formation is the democrat. E.J., you wrote this book, Souled Out \u2014 that is S-O-U-L-E-D \u2014 Souled Out: Reclaiming Faith and Politics After the Religious Right. But I don\u2019t think the post-Religious Right era has turned out the way you or many people actually thought it would. I mean, you talked about things like a new reformation that you thought would follow. Religious moderates \u2014 this new reformation will privilege religious moderation over religious conservatism. You also talked about how many Americans, and not just atheists, at many points in these last 20, 30 years would have been very happy for religious voices to shut up and clear out the public square. I guess my point is \u2014 I think to a great extent they have. I mean, they are not a force in political life the way they were before. But are we in a better place for that? Again, what is religion in the public square in this post-Religious Right era? What are its contours? We\u2019re in a worse place for it. I think a lot of us are nostalgic for an era when you had Reinhold Niebuhr, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Paul Tillich, an era where there were public theologians gathering a mass audience, appearing on the cover of Timemagazine, and that wasn\u2019t necessarily because they brought their denominational knowledge, but because they spoke fluidly about the spirit, the emotions, and they brought a moral conversation. I happen to think we are now in a culture that\u2019s over-politicized and under-moralized. And so E.J. and I go on TV shows, and we talk about every slight wiggle in whatever the candidates are doing that happened that week, but there is so little conversation about the virtues of suffering, what sin is, what the word \u201Credemption\u201D means. These are words that have fallen out of the common vocabulary and been replaced among my students with simply a utilitarian vocabulary. So I do think one of the reasons I long for a more active religious voice in the public square \u2014 and I have a set of formulas, where \u2014 we need to become more communitarian in a society that has become too individual. We need to become more moralistic in a society that\u2019s too utilitarian. And we need to be more emotional in a society that is too cognitive. And religion speaks those three languages very well. And without them, we\u2019re just denuded. And it\u2019s not that we\u2019re bad; we\u2019re just morally inarticulate. I think one of the contrasts that I think about that relates to what David said is when you think about the Civil Rights Christianity that rose in the \u201850s and \u201860s \u2014 it was underground before that, but it was a Civil Rights Christianity, very much supported by Niebuhr, by Heschel even though he was Jewish but was a great friend of Dr. King\u2019s. And there was a spirit in that form of Christianity that was, on the one hand, militant and demanding of justice. But on the other hand, the preaching of Martin Luther King was very much about conversion and redemption. And King actually believed you could convert adversaries. And we have very little of a sense that conversion is possible now in our political conversation. And conversion is a two-way street. People have to change themselves as they engage with each other. Right. So by \u201Cconversion\u201D you mean that willingness to be changed by each other. Yes. There\u2019s the old religious formation, \u201CHate the sin, love the sinner.\u201D I think we should fear Trump but understand that, while some of his constituency \u2014 and Hillary Clinton got a lot of grief for this \u2014 racial backlash plays a real role in the Trump vote. That\u2019s just true. That\u2019s been true in politics for a long time. But the discontents that people who are on the progressive side ought to be dealing with \u2014 the guy in the factory who discovers the factory isn\u2019t there anymore and his income is cut in half. I think after this election is over, which is \u2014 I agree with you \u2014 where we can usefully take this, I do think we need a conversation across these lines. I\u2019d love to see Hillary Clinton, if she won, spending the first few weeks going to the parts of the country she lost, going to Appalachia, going to the smaller mill towns and saying, \u201CThere is a problem here. You have a legitimate grievance. We need, as a society, to lift everybody up, and we\u2019re not doing that.\u201D That\u2019s the kind of conversion approach that King had. But I think this religious mainstream that David just talked about is much weaker in our public conversation altogether. If I could be \u2014 I mean, the old \u201850s mainline Protestant is not coming back. Sorry. But I\u2019ve sort of been quietly delighted by the events of the campaign as it affects, frankly, the future of the Christians\u2019 presence in the American public because the people who endorse Donald Trump on the Republican side and on the evangelical side did so obviously because he embodies the Christian virtues of humility, grace, charity. No. They did so because \u201Cevangelical\u201D had become a noun, an identity group, and he thought he was the power player for their identity group. But the people who did so tended to be older and part of the fading evangelical establishment. And if you look at people under 40, our young rising leaders like Russell Moore, they were all appalled from the beginning. And the polls now suggest Millennials are becoming disaffected from religion, and I get that. But as I go around, especially to cities, I see just an exploding religion that, believe me, is deeply religious but the opposite of Trumpism. Say, pick New York City. There is a burgeoning supply of these churches, these Trinity Grace churches that are all around the city. There\u2019s C3 churches, which I went to one in Williamsburg in Brooklyn a few months ago, and every beautiful hipster in New York seemed to be at that church. If you wanted to be where the cool crowd was, that church was it. And the Redeemer plants that are spreading. And I think probably most of them are still checking the \u201CNone\u201D box on the Pew poll as unaffiliated, but this is their experience. And those, by the way, were the folks I was describing in the book. That was part of the point because the book did draw this very sharp line that David is drawing between the over-a-certain-age and younger evangelicals and others who are coming to religion, including some of the \u201CNones\u201D who are \u2014 some have rejected religion altogether. Some have simply rejected organized religion as they came to understand it but are still fascinated by religious questions. Why would we be surprised that people who came of age in those years of toxic religiosity would grow up allergic to religious stridency and wary of declaring themselves \u2014 declaring that as their identity? But I even think some of these people \u2014 I go to these churches, and they\u2019re all, like, 3. They\u2019re, like, right out of the womb, and so they grew up in an age of secularism. They\u2019ve got nothing to rebel against. Right. They have no baggage. They\u2019ve got no baggage, no bad associations. Now what\u2019s interesting to me is they go for a faith which is super charismatic, Hillsong, arms in the air \u2014 I\u2019ve never done that in my life. But religiously, reasonably rigorous in theology and in the study of Scripture and also incredibly affirming. So it\u2019s not Jonathan Edwards; it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 somebody else. OK, let\u2019s talk about sin. This is a word you have both used. I find it remarkable. So let\u2019s go there. David, you\u2019ve been talking about, as you quote Saint Augustine around the country, Saint Augustine\u2019s notion of \u201Cdisordered loves.\u201D That\u2019s a definition of sin, and also \u2014 but how that is also a way to diagnose us and the political state of our soul. Yes, somebody \u2014 it might have been C.S. Lewis said, \u201CSin \u2014\u201D or maybe Chesterton \u2014 \u201COriginal sin is the only concept with scientifically variable proof.\u201D That we are\u2026 I think Niebuhr said\u2026 I\u2019d attribute it to Niebuhr, and he got it from somebody else. Well, didn\u2019t Niebuhr say, \u201CYou just have to read today\u2019s newspaper to know there\u2019s something to it?\u201D Yeah, or look in the mirror. \u201COriginal sin is the only empirically verifiable doctrine of the Christian church.\u201D Yeah, it\u2019s one of my favorite lines. And so the question is \u2014 and for me, the challenge was how to express it in a secular audience. I\u2019m a secular writer. I don\u2019t write for religious audiences. I write for The New York Times. How secular can you get? My joke \u2014 I can\u2019t help inserting my joke of being a conservative columnist at The New York Timesis like being Chief Rabbi at Mecca. It\u2019s not a lot\u2026 Not totally fair, but it\u2019s a joke. So, I wrote this book, and Augustine was central to it, and I think the awareness of sin is central to Niebuhr \u2014 that we are more sinful than we think even when we think we\u2019re taking the purest action, and we have to be aware of that sinfulness. But how do you talk about sin in modern America? And I had gone on the Charlie Rose show, my closest encounter to heaven until recently \u2014 no, I\u2019m kidding \u2014 and I had talked about my book before it came out, and I had talked about the word \u201Csin.\u201D And I got an email from an editor in New York at a different publishing house, and he said, \u201CI love the way you were talking about your book, but I didn\u2019t like the way you used that word \u2018sin.\u2019 It\u2019s a downer. Use the word \u2018insensitive\u2019 instead.\u201D And so I forwarded his email to my editor at Random House \u2014 it was sort of a test of him \u2014 and he said, \u201CWell, that\u2019s why you\u2019re writing the book, to redeem sin.\u201D But then how do you talk about it? You really can\u2019t talk about \u201Coriginal sin.\u201D People will just push you away. And so I go to Augustine\u2019s concept of \u201Cdisordered loves\u201D which is we all love a lot of things, and we all know some loves are higher than others. Our love of truth should be higher than our love of money, but because of some screw-up in our nature, we get our loves out of order all the time. So if a friend blabs to you a secret and you tell it at a dinner party, you\u2019re putting your love of popularity above your love of friendship, and that\u2019s a sin. And I think, in this world, which doesn\u2019t like to peer darkly into brokenness, it\u2019s easier to swallow the concept of two positive things that are out of order. And that\u2019s a way you can introduce the concept of sin. But a lot of what we have to do now is reintroduce these concepts in a way that people won\u2019t immediately think you\u2019re preaching at them. Right, right. Or it\u2019s a downer. And E.J., you wrote this: \u201CI believe a serious embrace of Christianity inevitably leads one into politics, since sin is social as well as individual.\u201D It\u2019s been one of the classic arguments between more progressive and more conservative Christians about where is the emphasis on social sin versus individual sin? And one area, for example, where that often comes out is in our discussion of family life. Because, on the one hand, if you care about family values, you\u2019ve got to care about social justice. Because one of the reasons the family is under such pressure is the way in which the economy is a battering ram at times against the family, particularly among folks who have lost jobs that once supported families. So you cannot look at family breakup without looking at the economic factors. On the other hand \u2014 and this is really the theme of Bob Putnam\u2019s Our Kids \u2014 we also know that, as a practical matter, most of the time, two parents are better than one, and that kids who grow up in sort of stable, intact families are likely to do better. Conservatives want to talk about one-half of that truth. Progressives want to focus on the other half of that truth. And yet, they are really part of one truth that we need to discuss. And I actually think, oddly\u2026 To discuss more holistically. More holistically and where each side needs to accept an insight. But I do think that we need to acknowledge the role of individual and social responsibility and that the two have almost always gone together. And we often, in politics, drive them apart. You can listen again and share this conversation with E.J. Dionne and David Brooks through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. In this strange, tumultuous political moment, we\u2019re taking a long view of the challenge and promise we will all be living as citizens, whoever becomes president on November 8. David Brooks and E.J. Dionne are renowned as journalists, authors, and commentators for The New York Times and The Washington Post respectively \u2014 and they\u2019re known together as sparring partners on public media. But I\u2019m drawing them out in depth and at length before a gathering of the John C. Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis. E.J., one of the things you\u2019ve pointed out is that \u2014 you write a lot about the joy of the progressive worldview, but a weakness is, as Niebuhr understood, a lack of awareness of human frailty. And I want to come to something \u2014 David, you\u2019ve been writing about the lack of aspirational thinking in political culture right now, and I actually wonder if there is some connection. David \u2014 I just want to read \u2014 this is a column you wrote on September 30: \u201CThere is no uplift in this race. There is an entire absence in both campaigns of any effort to appeal to the higher angels of our nature. There is an assumption in both campaigns that we are self-seeking creatures rather than also loving, serving, hoping, dreaming, cooperating creatures. There is a presumption in both candidates that the lowest motivations are the most real. At some point, there will have to be a new vocabulary and a restored anthropology emphasizing love, friendship, faithfulness, solidarity, and neighborliness that pushes people toward connection rather than distrust.\u201D And then you said, \u201CMillennials want to be active in this rebinding, but inspiration certainly isn\u2019t coming from the aging Boomers now on stage.\u201D Always bashing the Boomers. That\u2019s an excellent description of the Trump campaign. I actually want to have that conversation. A partisan note rears its ugly head. No, I just.. But no, do you\u2026 I want to \u2014 let me just say before \u2014 David, I really do think that\u2019s a false equivalence. That while you are right about the overall tenor of this campaign, I really do think that it does \u2014 the critique weighs far more heavily on the Trump side of the campaign and that you can argue that Clinton has failed to make this positive side of her campaign penetrate more. But I would assert that that has a lot more to do with the nature of the choice and that some of that is still there. But I wonder if what this is about, actually, to try to pull away from the election, is again, the narrative we privilege, right? I mean, there is a lot of aspirational thinking and aspirational action out there, but I think it is true that, on the whole, our political story is very dark, and it\u2019s not calling citizens to rise to their best selves or at least what we\u2019re emphasizing in the way \u2014 we journalists, what we\u2019re emphasizing in the way we report. I will always agree with E.J. that the Trump campaign is even worse than the Clinton campaign. That\u2019s a general rule. But a lot of our failures are failures because we have an inadequate ideal. And that\u2019s true in college life. That\u2019s true in adult life. We just don\u2019t have in our head what\u2019s possible, and we all \u2014 I\u2019ve read this phrase recently \u2014 we all walk in shoes too small for us. And I do think what\u2019s been lost in this country is the American ideal and the possibility of politics. Europeans came to these shores, and they saw forests that stretched on to infinity. They saw flocks of geese so big it took them 45 minutes to take off. They were overawed by the abundance, and they had two thoughts: that God\u2019s plan for humanity could be completed here on this continent, and two, they could get really rich in the process. Ever since, there has been this moral materialism has been driving Americans. And King had both an awareness of the deep sinfulness and a deep hopefulness about the arc of justice. And what\u2019s been lost, I think, is teaching that American story in the mainstream, and then, I think, celebrating the rituals that bind us together. And here, I\u2019ll get a little controversial. I do think there are so few things that bind us together, but the American creed is one of them and the rituals of Americanness are one of them. And I grew up really in an immigrant household, and our dream was making it in America, which meant getting out of Brooklyn and Queens or the Bronx. And that dream was the powering dream, as it has been for a lot of people. And when you begin to kneel during the national anthem, you\u2019re weakening, I think, or insulting not the current reality which we all want to insult, but the possibility that we\u2019ll end up in the same place. And I think you\u2019re also insulting the inherent radicalism of the country, that the Declaration, even the national anthem, certainly the Constitution, are not status quo reactionary documents from an old establishment. They\u2019re radical, and radicals have always used them as the strongest hammer for change. Not caring about politics is first, the luxury of those who live in a healthy society because those who live in a corrupt society and a violent society don\u2019t have the luxury of not caring about politics. The people I know who have served in government, for them, that\u2019s the most intense moment of their life because the decisions are the most consequential. I have a close friend who is in the Obama Administration now, and she says, \u201CEvery day sucks. The overall experience is tremendously rewarding.\u201D I think, somehow, we have to revive the idealism of political service. And politics in a democratic republic is about solving problems and resolving disputes peacefully, usually through argument and negotiation. We don\u2019t even know how to argue anymore. Bill Buckley, when he had his Firing Line show, engaged in real argument. He brought on really smart liberals whom he really engaged with. We don\u2019t have that kind of argument right now, so I think we have to ennoble the word \u201Cargument,\u201D and we also have to ennoble the word \u201Cpolitics.\u201D I opened up my Twitter feed \u2014 and I really do not read every tweet that comes through \u2014 but I happened to see yours, I don\u2019t know, a couple weeks ago. It said, \u201CReading Habakkuk in church,\u201D \u2014 quoting from the Bible \u2014 \u201C\u2018There is strife and clamorous discord. The rash one has no integrity.\u2019\u201D Clamorous discord as something in contrast to argument. E.J., you\u2019re live-tweeting the Eucharist. He\u2019s live-tweeting. In fact, a friend of mine tweeted back, \u201CYou\u2019re tweeting in church,\u201D and I said, \u201CNo, I did that from the parking lot.\u201D \u201CI waited until after Mass before I sent that tweet.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with journalists E.J. Dionne and David Brooks. All right, we\u2019re running out of time, and I\u2019m in radio, so I believe in the clock. I think to your point, E.J., a minute ago, it\u2019s not that everything is equal, but there is something about the way we\u2019re all now in react mode, and there\u2019s also something completely disordered about the way \u2014 and I think you would both agree \u2014 the way we cover things that skews, that is not good for us. It\u2019s not good for common life. We\u2019re not going to solve that this week. But the truth is that behind what comes out as clamorous discord and rashness and anger and sometimes what looks like danger, there is a lot of what\u2019s actually happening among people in the country. And you said you would like to see Hillary Clinton out listening to those people, but I think it\u2019s not just about listening for policy options, right? I mean, I think something that Donald Trump has done is that he has let pain be in the room. So I mean, let\u2019s talk about, thinking as we move out of this discussion into this world we\u2019re going to inhabit, what that work is. David, you wrote, as many journalists did, including just about every columnist in The New York Times, about waking up to this pain that you hadn\u2019t taken it seriously as you realized you should have. So, I wrote 6 million columns explaining why Donald Trump would not get the Republican nomination and decided that he\u2019ll be taking the oath of office, riding down Pennsylvania Avenue, and I\u2019ll be writing, \u201CDon\u2019t worry. This will not happen.\u201D And so then I\u2019ve spent the last seven months trying to figure out how I got that so wrong, and I will say that it\u2019s not been a depressing trip. There\u2019s a lot of pain I can talk about, but I\u2019m going to end on an up note, because everywhere I went, there were healers. In Houston, there\u2019s a little triangle where Latinos live within these three highways, and a woman from the northeast, young woman, realized there were no afterschool programs. So she moved in there, and she created an afterschool program with hundreds of kids. And I found those people everywhere. In New Mexico at a Navajo reservation, a couple that had moved down from Minneapolis started a drug treatment program for 60-year-old ex-cons, not glamorous work. They had 17 bucks in their bank account the day we visited. In D.C., I have two friends named Kathy and David, and they had a kid who went to a public school, and that kid had a friend who had no real home. His dad had split, mom had drug and health problems. So they said to the kid, \u201CCome over. Stay with us. You can live with us. Eat if you need. Go to school.\u201D And then that kid had a friend in the same circumstance, and that kid had a friend. If you go to them \u2014 their house \u2014 and I do every Thursday and hopefully on Mondays \u2014 there\u2019s 10, 15, 25 kids there 18 to 22 just getting some food. Last week, a young woman came and said she was 21. This was the first time she\u2019d been around a dinner table since she was 11. And I took my daughter once, and she said, \u201CThis is the warmest home I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201D They call Kathy and David Mom and Dad, and there\u2019s just a warmth and embrace. What we give them \u2014 we, as adults, give them the gift of being their audience. So there\u2019s a kid named Ed who would read from his flip phone poetry he\u2019d written. There\u2019s a woman named Kasari who would sing like a New Orleans jazz singer. And you just receive them, and they define themselves in front of you. And what they gave to us was a complete intolerance for social distance. So when I meet most of you, I shake hands, and there\u2019s a little distance there because we don\u2019t really know each other. But the first time I walked into their house, I reached my hand out to one of the kids, and he said, \u201CWe don\u2019t shake hands here. We hug.\u201D And so \u2014\u00A0big hugs and you\u2019re just physically draped around each other. We were in a forum, and I quoted this guy, Bill Milliken, who happened to be in the audience last time Krista and I were together, and he\u2019s been working on youth issues for 50 years. And he said, \u201CI\u2019m often asked in 50 years of doing this, what programs work to turn around lives?\u201D And he said, \u201CI\u2019ve done this 50 years. I\u2019ve never seen a program turn around a life. I see relationships turn around lives, and I see love turn around lives.\u201D And so setting up those contexts is what\u2019s being done at a local level, and the problem for journalists \u2014 and this is why religion has become a way of seeing the world for me \u2014 a lot of things are more clear and more explicable if you begin with the presence that each of us has a God-given human soul, all of which are equal. And suddenly, you begin to see the soul in each person, and how that soul was created, and how it was formed, and what it longs for. And when you see that, you see on a much more personalist level. Emerson said, \u201CSouls are not saved in bundles.\u201D Some of the big arcs and spheres of politics seem a little less relevant, and the individual relationships seem a lot more important, and you begin to adopt a more personalist and I think a more realistic lens. So Donald Trump has given me a reason to live this year, to oppose him, but I confess I\u2019ve lost a lot of interest in politics because it doesn\u2019t seem to me the primary reality anymore. I just want to say on that last note that I have never \u2014 I can\u2019t think of anyone who loves politics more than I do, and I have never seen a campaign that I wanted to end so much, so quickly as this one. I have never felt that way in my entire life, and I\u2019ve thought about why. I want to underscore something David said which is the notion that each person is endowed with dignity by God is one of the most powerful and radical ideas that we have available to us. If I made a hat that looked like the Donald Trump hat, it would be, \u201CMake America Empathetic Again.\u201D I think that, again, what I referred to earlier, I would like the empathy to run both ways. It is fair to criticize parts of the Trump movement for racism, for a feeling about immigrants that is absolutely unacceptable, attitudes toward immigrants that is absolutely unacceptable. There are traces of anti-Semitism in some of that movement. We should call all those out. And we would ask people on that side to have empathy for the young kid who was shot on the street who was unarmed, who is African-American. To have empathy for a child who has come here as an immigrant kid who wants to advance in our society. But what we owe in return is the empathy for people on the other side. There shouldn\u2019t be groups that it is fashionable to be empathetic toward and unfashionable to be empathetic toward. And one of the things that strikes me the most, and one of the great losses of politics in this campaign is if you look at the forces that have hurt people in the inner city, the deindustrialization, the loss of jobs that were providing mobility routes for African-Americans, they\u2019re exactly the same problems of deindustrialization that have affected white working-class people, and we desperately need a conversation that brings two groups that are at odds together. So I want to close in two ways. One is just with two of my favorite thoughts about politics. One is a line from Mike Sandel that I sort of think of all the time, the philosopher Mike Sandel who said, \u201CWhen politics goes well, we can know a good in common that we cannot know alone.\u201D That is the proper view of politics. And another one from a writer called Glenn Tinder talked about our need to create \u201Cthe attentive society,\u201D which is a society in which all of us acknowledge the need both to give and to receive help on the road to truth. So I did tell David that I wanted him to read a poem at the end, but he\u2019s proposed a song. Beyonce\u2019s \u201CFormation.\u201D And E.J. said that all of his columns are poetry. And I\u2019m going to have to invoke my moderator\u2019s discretion and say we don\u2019t have time, sadly, for either of your presentations. I do, however \u2014 so E.J., I want to come back to end this with a question that you raised in Souled Out, or a challenge that, in the post-Religious Right era, \u201Cwe need to develop a more capacious imagination about the proper role of religion in political life,\u201D and I would just add, public life. And I actually want to read some words of Senator John Danforth, possibly an answer he might give if he were up here with us. \u201CIf there was a Christian agenda for politics, what should it be? I, for one, cannot be certain. Then one might ask, \u2018What does faith bring to politics if not an agenda?\u2019 For me, it brings a struggle to do God\u2019s will that always falls short of the goal. It leavens the competing self interests of politics with the yeast of the Love Commandment, but it seldom fulfills the Love Commandment. It makes us better participants in politics, but not the custodians of God\u2019s politics.\u201D So just to close, I\u2019d like to ask you both \u2014 and maybe E.J. you first, since you posed that question \u2014 tell us, give us some of the contours of that more \u201Ccapacious imagination\u201D for you about how this might come to work. There are a few things I\u2019d like to see happen, some of which are happening, and David alluded to some of them. All the great religious traditions emphasize our obligations to the least among us, to the marginal, to the left out. Are there ways of talking across stark political lines about what we can do together about this? People here might be amused to know that 20 years ago, I think, David and I were asked to write about compassionate conservatism for The Washington Post. I defended compassionate conservatism, and David criticized it. And I think there was a loss. The compassionate conservatives fail for a variety of reasons, but there were some insights there that ought to be able to open a new conversation again. And if Hillary Clinton wins, actually, it\u2019s intriguing because she is actually very interested in the role of religious institutions in building civil society and solving problems. So I\u2019d like a conversation about poverty. I\u2019ve alluded to a conversation about family life. And it\u2019s not a judgmental conversation; it\u2019s just a realistic conversation about what we owe children in our society at this moment, an understanding that the America that was, as Will Herberg said in the \u201850s, \u201CProtestant, Catholic, Jew,\u201D is now Protestant, Catholic, Jew, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, and a whole lot of other things. Secular humanist. Yes, and secular humanists and atheists. And we need a different kind of religious conversation, and that\u2019s fair. Lastly, I wish that religion could play a role in bringing us together. There used to be a time when people who disagreed went to the same churches or congregations. They had an instinctive trust in each other. They could argue from respect, and they didn\u2019t assume bad faith. Is there any way in which religious institutions could try to play that role again? I came from a very argumentative extended family, and we always argued about politics, and we never doubted that we loved each other. You cannot do that very much in our politics now outside the family, and I think our religious institutions might struggle to be venues for that. And I\u2019m not talking about bringing people together artificially. The hardest thing to reach is authentic disagreement but not disagreement among people who then leave and hate each other forever but disagreement among people who respect each other and know they have to live with each other the next morning. I was once writing in a newspaper column. I was griping about how hard it was to get people to be good by my lectures to them in my classroom, and I got an email from a guy named Dave Jolly who is a veterinarian in Oregon. He said, \u201CWhat a wise person says is the least of that which he gives. What gets communicated is the small gestures and the whole totality of their being, that is to say the small gestures of kindness, of grace, of honesty, of hard truth-telling.\u201D And then he says, \u201CNever forget the message is the person.\u201D And those words rang in \u2014 because we deal in the words all the time, but those sentences, \u201CWhat a wise person says is the least of that which he gives,\u201D and, \u201CThe message is the person,\u201D struck me as profoundly true. E.J. knows intra-Catholic Church politics better than I do, but with Pope Francis, to me, \u201CThe message is the person.\u201D We know a guy. I think you know Monsignor Ray East in D.C., just a joyous person who looks for the Good News in people and just treats each day and each problem with a sense of graciousness and joy. I know a rabbi named Meir Soloveichik on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the same spirit, and it seems to me what religion guides us towards is not necessarily policies but certain ways of being just by valuing them. And you don\u2019t need religion to be a good person. Believe me, I know a lot of religious people who are complete schmucks. But I do think it puts its emphasis on humility, radical self-awareness from a position of other-centeredness, awareness of the deep equality of all human beings because each of us are broken in similar ways. Grace, the receiving and giving of unmerited love, these are just things that are talked about. So from a politics of the future, what I would hope for is not necessarily certain policies or theological discussion but just ways of being. The people we remember then stick in our heads. I go to the modern Orthodox churches \u2014 synagogues, we call them\u2026 Telltale sign from David. And I just see young people who are theologically super rigorous and warm to each other. And then I go to the churches I mentioned in Brooklyn and Williamsburg, the super hipster churches, and there\u2019s just a native warmth. And you just are drawn to that like flowers to the sun. And so all I want out of religion is just a little more human decency inspired by a devotion to God. I do think that\u2019s imminently possible and imminently happening. Well, I do think we don\u2019t have Niebuhrs anymore, and we don\u2019t have Heschels, but I think that the mantle of public theology actually can fall on journalists, and we\u2019ve seen that demonstrated. It\u2019s very interesting. So thank you David Brooks. Thank you E.J. Dionne. And thank you so much to the Danforth Center for bringing us all together.
