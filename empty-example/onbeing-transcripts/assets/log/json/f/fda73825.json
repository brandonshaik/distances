  "fullText": "It was supposed to be a discussion of culture and conscience with two social scientists. Biological anthropologist Melvin Konner has studied the evolution of childhood; social psychologist Jonathan Haidt gained prominence with his work on why good people are divided by politics and religion. Now he\u2019s studying the relationship between capitalism and human conscience. The liberal view of capitalism as essentially exploitative may remain alive and well, he says, but the ironic truth of history is that capitalism, while championed by conservatives, actually generates liberal values as it takes root in societies. Our conversation preceded this cultural-political season, but offers provocative perspective on it. I\u2019m not optimistic about the American government, but I am very optimistic about America\u2019s future, because I think people our age who grew up expecting that the point of civic engagement is to be active, so we can make the government fix civil rights or something, we\u2019ve got to make the government do something. And young people have grown up never seeing the government do anything except turn the lights off now and then. And so they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 their activism is not going to be to get the government to do things. It\u2019s going to be to invent some app, some way of solving problems separately. And that\u2019s going to work. So I\u2019m actually very optimistic about the future, just not the congress. But, the idea that we\u2019re more polarized than we\u2019ve ever been, I think, is not true. If you read about the election of 1800, you see, by far, the nastiest presidential election this country has ever \u2026 Right. But since the Civil War. We are more polarized than we\u2019ve been since the Civil War. I thought the Civil War was a pretty serious episode of polarization. Yeah, that\u2019s why I start my counting after the Civil War. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Jonathan Haidt teaches ethical leadership at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Melvin Konner teaches in the departments of anthropology and neuroscience and behavioral biology at Emory University. We were gathered by the Center for Humans and Nature for its \u201CQuestions for a Resilient Future\u201D series. I\u2019m so happy to be back at the American Museum of Natural History, and to be here with Humans in Nature, the Center for Biodiversity. This question of the connection between culture and conscience is fascinating, and we are only going to kind of skim the surface tonight. But I hope we will skim the surface in a way that will be intriguing and leave all of us with lots to ponder. And I think that a thread that runs through both of your writing on this subject is that, like our understanding of the world, like the lifespan of a species or a human being, like culture, conscience, too, has an evolutionary quality to it, an evolutionary trajectory. Mel, you\u2019ve said, \u201CHuman nature, like the body, has evolved slowly over time.\u201D So, I\u2019d like to start by way of also getting a definition of terms, and a sense of the evolution in your own understanding of this, to just spend a little time on the origins of your sense of the meaning of conscience, where you started out in your earliest life. So Jon, your parents were Jewish, second-generation American, union organizers. My grandparents were union organizers, yes. Your grandparents were union organizers. So they were on that exploitative capitalism narrative. That\u2019s right. They were fighting the fight that needed to be fought back then. So how would you start to talk about how you, in your earliest life, internalized the meaning of conscience? What are its raw materials and sources? Gosh. Making it personal here. I have to now reflect \u2014 well, actually there\u2019s interesting developmental research that we\u2019re socialized in a sense more by our peers and those around us than we are directly by our parents. Our parents set up the conditions for our lives. And my parents gave me and my sisters very, very good conditions. And beyond that, I think I\u2019m very much a product of upper-middle-class, Jewish-New-York-suburbs America. I then went to Yale, where I very much fit in with the very left-wing, social-activist kind of view. So I think I\u2019m very much a product \u2014 my morals, my values, are very much a product of my time. I will say that what I\u2019ve learned in starting to do this research on capitalism and studying the World Values Survey is that I used to think that culture mostly should be thought of as a set of ideas that previous generations created, a network of meanings that comes down to us. And what I now see is that while that is true, so much of what we are actually emerges from the conditions of our childhood. And the fact that I grew up in such different conditions from my parents means that whatever messages they wanted to give me wouldn\u2019t necessarily fit. Oh, interesting. So, I think actually our local environments in a way have more to do than our parents do. Mm-hmm. Which is discouraging for all of us who are parents. Well, just pick a good environment. Except we don\u2019t \u2026 And then it gets you off the hook. Right. Exactly. We worry we\u2019re not doing a good enough job, so that may not matter so much. So, Mel, you were raised in a \u2014 your parents were Orthodox Jewish. Right. They were also both deaf. Correct. Yeah. I wonder how you \u2014 again, this question, how did you \u2014 if you think about that, how did you internalize \u2014 how did you start out in terms of what conscience was? I came from a lower-middle-class family, and my mother\u2019s parents, who were not deaf, and who were very religious, and lived with us during my early childhood, until I was eight or so. My grandfather was responsible for putting me in the stream of religious training, and so I stayed. I was in the synagogue pretty much every day from age eight until 16 or so. And I was imbued with the idea that there are negative impulses in our nature that have to be controlled by reference to scripture, basically, to some sort of revealed text or some sort of model. And these stories have motivated billions of people, and continue to do that. So I think things are now changing faster, culture is now changing faster than it ever has before. And the real \u2014 but the real question, I think, is if you don\u2019t have the example of Christ or Buddha, if you don\u2019t have scripture, if you don\u2019t have karma and a future life, why be good? Why not just be selfish? And we all know that it\u2019s perfectly compatible with atheism to be a really good person. And as the world becomes more secular and rational, we have to hope that there will be an orderly transition to a good world without a codebook. OK. So I think what we\u2019re going to talk about for the next hour is how that orderly \u2014 what are the ingredients of that orderly transition? And one thing that\u2019s interesting to me in your writing is, you talk about that religious world of your childhood and also these other religious worlds, as you describe \u2014 certainly the Southern Baptist religious world of mine \u2013 that we have evil tendencies and we have good tendencies, but the good ones need commandments to flourish. You\u2019ve also looked at the evolution of how culture instills conscience in children. And it was also true of Puritan ancestors, that you had to \u2014 well, you said, you had to \u2014 that without fear, there was no conscience. That these things had to be drilled in and there \u2026 \u201CSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201D What, I\u2019m sorry? \u201CSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201D Yeah, \u201CSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201D Which turns out to not really be true. Turns out to not be \u2014 but it kind of makes you wonder \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, you talk about, Freud comes along, Piaget comes along. There are ways in which we start to study children differently, ask different questions. To me, there\u2019s a question of, do we change? And we start to see that young human beings instinctively understand that there\u2019s a point to rules, that there\u2019s something called \u201Cplaying fair\u201D that makes sense. And then we get to the point where we are now in the early 21st century, and someone like you can say it this way, that empathy is in us from the beginning, as a potential, right? Not necessarily in everyone. \u201CA kind of emotional-brain resonance enhanced by mirror neurons,\u201D which is a whole other way of looking at ourselves. I\u2019m fascinated by the evolution of our way of grappling with this. Well, I think it\u2019s been a positive evolution in most ways. Say some more. It\u2019s astounding how steady the progress has been in reducing infant mortality, reducing child mortality. At least a couple of our four kids have trouble to take an optimistic view of the future or the recent past, which is, as my wife, Ann, points out, I was exactly in that place when I was their age. But, I do think that we have a really hard job to do in the next 50 to 100 years. As I say, anthropologists take the long view. I take the long view, so I\u2019m optimistic. But there are going to be ten billion people before the end of this century. The population of Africa alone is going to quadruple in size by current projections. That is the poorest part of the world.To me, it\u2019s not guaranteed that the trajectory will be relentlessly up. Because it\u2019s not the hungry mouths, but it\u2019s about the overall aspirations that those people have. It\u2019s about the people in villages in Africa and India who are today looking at one TV set in their village showing our lifestyle. How do we, as a species, make this transition if we\u2019re convinced that we can\u2019t support ten billion people in a lifestyle like ours? And we\u2019re also convinced that there are going to be ten billion people. Yeah. Which, Jon, I think actually leads in an interesting way to the direction your thinking has been taking, this idea that culture creates conscience, that capitalism \u2014 I don\u2019t mean that culture changes conscience \u2014 that capitalism, which is the economic milieu. I thought your phrase that the 20th century was a great referendum on, is there an alternative economic system? Of course, there are so many \u2014 there\u2019s biodiversity of capitalism, right? Mm-hmm. But this is what we have. But your analysis that there are different stages of capitalism. Would you say a little bit about that? Because I think it gets at Mel\u2019s question of \u2014 it kind of shakes up the scenario if we think that capitalism itself, as it grows, as we have more people who are living in these societies, also begins to change, and change us differently. Right. So, when I was in college, I first read Richard Dawkins\u2019 book, The Selfish Gene. And like many people, it just blew my mind. And Darwin\u2019s ideas are so simple. From a few principles, you can explain all the diversity of life on earth, and that was a really transformative experience for me. And then when I started reading about the history of capitalism, I had the same experience. I just happened to buy a set of lectures from The Teaching Company by an intellectual historian named Jerry Muller. I highly recommend it, M-U-L-L-E-R. He has a book on the history of capitalism, but he has a set of lectures there on the history of capitalism. And in listening to them, I had the same experience that I had reading Richard Dawkins. I was about 48 years old at the time. I\u2019m well educated. And I knew nothing about the system that explains why everything is here, including this microphone, this glass, our clothing, us, the transportation \u2014 everything. And so capitalism is as powerful and important as Darwinian evolution. And in fact, it\u2019s very much the same thing. When you have variation and competition and selection, you get this incredible energy, you get this incredible adaptability. So I guess what I\u2019m saying is that I wish everybody in high school \u2014 here\u2019s what I wish we could do. Let\u2019s cancel two years of math for all of our high school students, everything beyond basic algebra, you don\u2019t need, even if you\u2019re a scientist you don\u2019t need it. So, cancel most of the math, and put in statistics, basic economics, and I think introductory psychology. But, anyway, the point is everybody should learn about capitalism and evolution by the time they\u2019re 18. And at present we don\u2019t. And that means we have stupid discussions about policy. And here\u2019s just a very simplistic sentence, but a sentence of yours: \u201CAs people become richer and safer, their values change.\u201D Yep. And there\u2019s kind of an ironic thing that happens that Marx did not foresee, that the beneficiaries of capitalist wealth, younger people, begin to demand more socially and environmentally responsible behavior from each other and from their governments. That\u2019s right. This is what we see in all of these rapidly emerging nations. The generation that \u2014 and you see this all over, you see it all over Asia, especially. The simple way to put it is that almost everybody in Asia has grandparents that grew up at times of either famine, war, disease. They could not count on a long future. The transition is particularly clear in Korea, which went from poverty and Japanese oppression to the Korean War. And that generation of Koreans, including my wife\u2019s family \u2014 they have these incredible virtues about family and saving and hard work. And they don\u2019t really care that much about human rights, and gender rights, and all these other sorts of things. But their kids, who were not raised with kind of privation and fear, their kids begin to care about all these things. And you see it all over Asia. The young generation begins to care more about animal rights, human rights, gay rights, women\u2019s rights. So here\u2019s the irony: the left generally hates capitalism, but capitalism changes everybody\u2019s values to be more leftist. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, in a public conversation about culture, conscience, and capitalism, with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and biological anthropologist Melvin Konner. I was thinking as I was reading to prepare for this about this ad on television right now, and I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s trying to sell. I think it\u2019s a computer. And it has these beautiful pictures of young children, and how they will be able to be who they want to be, or we want them to be, if you buy this product, whatever it is. Emancipative values. Yes. And it says something like, \u201CShe will clean the oceans.\u201D Right? Have you all seen that one? I thought, aren\u2019t we clever as a species that we mess up the oceans and then we raise children to clean them up? That\u2019s exactly it. But it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s right. And so there\u2019s a thing called the Kuznets curve. I don\u2019t know it well enough to explain it, but the general point \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. But the general point is that there are certain things that might happen \u2026 That\u2019s because you studied math. Yeah, if only I\u2019d \u2014 But there are certain processes where we might, with increasing development, pollute more and more. And that certainly has happened. But then we begin to care about it, and we develop technologies so that now what\u2019s happening is for each additional unit of growth, we\u2019re polluting less and less and less. Of course, the total pollution is still going up, but that\u2019s going to start turning soon. And especially \u2014 and this is to build on what Mel was saying \u2014 the population is going to be turning. So all over Asia, East Asia, Europe, even Latin America, India\u2019s still above two, but it\u2019s dropping. So outside of Sub-Saharan Africa, birthrates are below two. And the total population will begin dropping in a few decades. So the 22nd century is going to be one that\u2019s vastly depopulated, except in Africa. So it\u2019s two very different planets. And the story in Africa, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. And eventually I expect these changes will happen. Or, I think we see what\u2019s happening. Africa is moving to Europe. Right. And that\u2019s going to have to continue. And that may not be such a bad thing. I take your point about capitalism being similar to Darwinian evolution in certain ways, but you want it to be similar to the last lines of The Origin of Species: \u201CBeautiful forms, most wonderful, are being evolved.\u201D And you don\u2019t want it to be like Darwin\u2019s letter to Joseph Hooker about \u201Cthe wasteful blundering, low, and horribly cruel works of nature.\u201D But both can be true at the same time. It has been at times like that bad kind of Darwinian evolution. And it might be again, if our conscience, collective conscience, doesn\u2019t respond to the demands of the short-term future. Yeah, and I feel like there are some echoes in this way you see our present and our future. With the complexity even of that rabbinical tradition you grew up in that we are at one and the same time capable of helping and harming. Even the refugee crisis that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 I think I\u2019ve never been so moved as when I heard Angela Merkel say to her fellow Germans, \u201CThis will change us and we have to do it so that it changes us for the better.\u201D But, as you\u2019re saying, it may in fact work out that way, but with some very hard, harsh decades in between. So how do we how do we make those decades less harsh? The good news is we are, the last couple of generations, the first people on the planet to have a conscience about the whole planet, to have a conscience about all non-living things, to have a sense of humanity as one thing. And I\u2019m going to bet that every person in this room has that sense, even though there are plenty of people in the world who don\u2019t have that kind of conscience yet. But their children will. But their children do, or will, or at least might. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s so important, also, to name that, to point that out, because everybody in this room takes it for granted. Right. And you can\u2019t really watch the news for very long and take it for granted, even though the trends that Jon pointed out, and that Pinker has pointed out are real. Even including World War I and World War II, the 20th century was still the least violent century per capita\u2026 In history. \u2026in human history up until then. We don\u2019t want to see those kinds of things happen again. And I think we can\u2019t really take anything for granted. I think there\u2019s a bit of perspective problem here on human nature. It\u2019s often said that conservatives have more of a dark view of human nature as being sinful. Liberals are said to have a more positive view of human nature, sort of the John Lennon idea that if we could just get rid of government and religion that we\u2019d all be nice. Yet at the same time, liberals are so committed to a narrative of oppression and exploitation that they can\u2019t take good news, they can\u2019t accept good news. So, for various reasons, the left and the right are negative in different ways. Now, my view, having immersed myself in human evolution \u2014 and I don\u2019t know, Mel, if you have the same experience \u2014 is I \u2014 Mel, we both dig into, how do we get civilization? What were hunter-gatherers like, and how did we get here? And my view is we\u2019re this little, tribal species that was basically just sort of beating each other up, and competing with each other in all these ways, and somehow or other, we\u2019ve risen so vastly far above our design specifications. I look around at us and I say, go humanity. We are fantastic. Yeah, there\u2019s ISIS, there\u2019s a lot of bad stuff, but you people who think that things are bad, you are expecting way too much. But I think, Jon, when you use the language like \u201Cconscience,\u201D and we assume that it\u2019s a good, or that there\u2019s progress, we\u2019re \u2026 There\u2019s restraint on our behavior that allows us to live with each other. Sure, it\u2019s good. But but a lot of what your work is about how liberals and conservatives, for example \u2014 as orientations, not as voting blocs \u2014 find each other\u2019s value systems to be inexplicable at best. Oh, yeah. That\u2019s part of our tribal nature. And possibly offensive at worst. Absolutely, yes. So even as we progress, if we assume that we are progressing, there\u2019s that dilemma. That\u2019s right. So this is a really interesting thing about democracy. So, in America, we worship it, and a lot of my research is on sacred values, and there\u2019s certain things \u2014 we worship democracy. Now, the founding fathers did not worship democracy. In fact, they thought it was a really bad system. They thought that the masses can\u2019t be trusted, so they gave us a republic. Well democracy has a lot of problems. When you sort of workshop fine details of policy in TV ads to try to make voters angry at the other side, that\u2019s a really bad way to do policy. And what I saw in many Asian countries, I was surprised to learn that they\u2019re experiencing the same polarization that we are. So in Korea, in Japan, in Taiwan, a few other countries \u2014 not China because they don\u2019t have parties at all \u2014 but in many other young democracies, the next generation is \u2014 they\u2019re all at each other\u2019s throats. It\u2019s over different issues in different countries, but polarization is a big problem for democracies. So our political institutions were developed various decades or centuries ago, and as human nature is changing, as things are changing, often they\u2019re not up to the task. So I\u2019m not optimistic about the American government, but I am very optimistic about America\u2019s future, because I think the people our age who grew up expecting that the point of civic engagement is to be active, so we can make the government fix civil rights or something, we\u2019ve got to make the government do something. And young people have grown up never seeing the government do anything except turn the lights off now and then. And so their activism is not going to be to get the government to do things. It\u2019s going to be to invent some app, some way of solving problems separately. And that\u2019s going to work. So I\u2019m actually very optimistic about the future, just not the congress. But the idea that we\u2019re more polarized than we\u2019ve ever been, I think, is not true. If you read about the election of 1800, you see, by far, the nastiest presidential election that this country has ever \u2026 Right. But since the Civil War. We are more polarized than we\u2019ve been since the Civil War. Well, the Civil War was a pretty serious episode of polarization. Yeah, that\u2019s why I start my counting after the Civil War. I guess I worry about complacency. I don\u2019t think that the founding generation expected things to go smoothly. No. Or that it went smoothly with them. Or that it went smoothly with them. Because they built in a complex understanding of human nature. Exactly. That that evil inclination is there, and that you needed to \u2026 The Constitution is a monograph out of a research lab on human nature. It\u2019s a bunch of people \u2014 mostly men, but some with very smart wives who contributed a lot, like Abigail Adams. And really taking a dark view of human nature and human potential, and seeing what had happened in Europe and wanting to construct an apparatus that really was a great achievement of social science \u2014 they had a conscience and they wanted the country to have it, but they also knew that in fact, what were then Whigs and Tories represented a permanent kind of division in human life between people who like things to progress faster and people who don\u2019t. And that hasn\u2019t changed. We call it terrible polarization, but it\u2019s \u2014 I agree with Jon on this that sometimes people seem, to me, to be expecting too much. You can listen again and share this conversation with Melvin Konner and Jonathan Haidt through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment."
