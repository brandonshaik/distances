  "fullText": "Marilyn Nelson is a storytelling poet. She gives winsome voice to forgotten people from history \u2014 and from her own family. She shines a light on the complicated ancestry we have in common and that can help us in the work we have to do together now. She\u2019s written for both adults and children. She\u2019s taught poetry and contemplative practice to West Point cadets. And alongside the gentle but mighty esteem, Marilyn Nelson commands in the communion of modern poets. She\u2019s a voice for all of us in the work and the privilege of what she calls \u201Ccommunal pondering.\u201D To sit with her is to gain a newly spacious perspective on what that might mean \u2014 and on why, in this troubled moment, Americans young and old are turning to poetry with urgency. Poetry consists of words and phrases and sentences that emerge like something coming out of water. They emerge before us, and they call up something in us. But then they turn us back into our own silence. And that\u2019s why reading poetry, reading it alone silently takes us someplace where we can\u2019t get ordinarily. Poetry opens us to this otherness that exists within us. Don\u2019t you think? You read a poem and you say, \u201CAh.\u201D And then you listen to what it brings out inside of you. And what it is is not words; it\u2019s silence. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Marilyn Nelson is professor emerita of English at the University of Connecticut, and a chancellor of The Academy of American Poets. I interviewed her at the inaugural Faith in Literature festival at the University of North Carolina Asheville. So, here we are. And I\u2019m just delighted to be up here with Marilyn Nelson. It\u2019s been such a treat to be reading your poetry these last few days. Thank you, Krista. You were born in Cleveland of a teacher mother and a father who was a member of the last graduating class of the Tuskegee airmen. And I wonder \u2014 and you were moving around a lot. A lot. Yeah. You and your sisters always imagined that, when you left each place, it disappeared, ceased to exist. And you did \u2014 this book, How I Discovered Poetry, it\u2019s a memoir in poems, right? Yes. And I just wondered \u2014 so I want to say, I said to Marilyn \u2014 I have a few books here. And I have some \u2014 we\u2019ll read some poetry throughout. I\u2019m going to ask her to read some things. We\u2019ll read some at the end. But I also said to her that, if she just feels called to grab one of these books and read, she can. But I wondered if you would just read the last poem in this collection, How I Discovered Poetry. Yes, OK. This one is called \u201CThirteen-Year-Old American Negro Girl.\u201D Each of these poems has a little byline of where we were at the time this \u2014 we were on an air force base in Oklahoma in 1959. \u201CThirteen-Year-Old American Negro Girl.\u201D \u201CMy face, as foreign to me as a mask, / allows people to believe they know me. / Thirteen-Year-Old American Negro Girl, / headlines would read if I was newsworthy. / But that\u2019s just the top-of-the-iceberg me. / I could spend hours searching the mirror / for clues to my truer identity, / if someone didn\u2019t pound the bathroom door. / You can\u2019t see what the mirror doesn\u2019t show: / for instance, that, after I close my book / and turn off my lamp, I say to the dark: / Give me a message I can give the world. / Afraid there\u2019s a poet behind my face, / I beg until I\u2019ve cried myself to sleep.\u201D Thank you. That\u2019s my sister banging on the bathroom door. And I don\u2019t know \u2014 do you want me to talk about it? For me, the crux of this poem is the fact that I really did pray, \u201CGive me a message that I can give the world.\u201D If you give me a message that I can give the world, I promise I\u2019ll be true to it. I will be honest to it. That was my 13-year-old prayer. \u201CLet me be a poet. Give me something to share.\u201D Right, so it came true. Praise God. Yeah, I think you did it. Thank you. I\u2019ll take this back, but you can grab it anytime. And is this one that you wrote \u2014 it feels to me, like, in a lot of your poetry, there\u2019s a public life implication, even if it\u2019s not a \u2014 even in that poem you just read. Is this a poem that you wrote at age 16, \u201CHere in Democratic Dominion?\u201D Yeah. Oh, yeah. Where did you find that one? Lily helps me prepare. \u201CHere in democrat dominion, / each man has his own opinion. / He can argue loud and long: / he has a right to his own wrong.\u201D This is why we\u2019re putting poetry on the air during election year. But you put poetry to family and history, to love and lynching, to motherhood and monasticism. I have to say what I love about Bob Dylan winning the Pulitzer is that it reminds me of a conversation I had \u2014 or not with the Pulitzer, the Nobel. I had a conversation with Paul Muldoon early this year, and he said \u2014 he loves music. He\u2019s also the poetry editor of The New Yorker. And he said, \u201CAmericans think they don\u2019t read poetry, but they walk around singing poetry all the time.\u201D Our music carries poetry, and they don\u2019t think of it that way. And I loved Dylan getting the Prize for that reason. I did too. Did you? Good. OK. I did. Yes. Because I know it\u2019s a little controversial. I did see that you worked with Lutherans after college, to that point, and you were invited \u2014 and you were a poet, and you were invited to serve on the hymn text committee, which is another way people in churches walk around with poetry, not calling it that. And you revised every text in the hymnal trying to remove traces of racism, sexism, and militarism. Yes. It was a huge job. Try to remove militarism from \u201COnward Christian Soldiers.\u201D It was a job the \u2014 if there are Lutherans here, it\u2019s the green hymnal \u2014 is the one that I worked on, and it was really a challenge. I was a kid. The other people on the committee were theologians and ministers with years of experience in congregations, but I was good at rhyming. You also write a lot about family. I think writers in general, but poets in particular have this exquisite tool for kind of getting inside the deep meaning of family and not having to make it neat and tidy. The Homeplace is your \u2014 are your poems \u2014 where you really went back to the history, your lineage really. I mean, just to give a little bit of description \u2014 these are very lively characters. These are a few generations of your family and aunts and grandmothers, and it\u2019s the things that are happening in the world around them. It\u2019s what they\u2019re having to reckon with, including the Ku Klux Klan. But it\u2019s also having babies, living in big, boisterous families, serving in the army, falling in love. Who was it \u2014 Aunt Geneva who was the wild one, fell in love with a white man. You have a character in there during the Civil War era named Henry Tyler. Ah, yes. He\u2019s a complicated character. Complicated\u2019s \u2014 yeah. And you let that be there. You just let that be there. Also, in the life of your family and your great grandmother, was it? Yes, yes. I mean, American history, especially in the South, goes across a lot of lines that we imagine are impermeable. They weren\u2019t impermeable. And my family believes one of our ancestors was this white man, Henry Tyler, and that the relationship he had with our foremother was \u2014 she didn\u2019t belong to him. It was during the years of slavery. But my family believes that this is a love story. And my cousin and I went to the town our family comes from. And of course, a lot of the old records have been burned, destroyed, but we did find a deed for a house in which he gave our foremother, Diverne, a house. And we take that to be some indication that the story we had inherited was a true story, that there was some kind of relationship there. Who knows what could\u2019ve happened, what kind of relationship was possible at that time? I don\u2019t know. But you also \u2014 he was a terrible racist and also a symbol, in many ways \u2014 or an example of\u2026 Yes. He went on to become a state senator or a state representative. Yeah, and he had been a part of, what\u2019s his name, Raiders \u2014 Forrest Raiders. That\u2019s a famous \u2014 I can\u2019t remember his name, and I\u2019d have to read the whole book to find it. But this man, somebody Forrest, who was a colonel or something in the Confederate army and our \u2014 this Henry Tyler fought under him. And this man, Forrest, our maybe purported forefather went on to have a career in politics in Kentucky. But this man, Forrest, became the originator of the Klan. So he went in that direction. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, these are things are that are verifiable. The relationship is not verifiable. I have \u2014 we just don\u2019t have any way of knowing things like that, other than DNA. And what we do know, luckily for me, in writing this book, is that our family, we are the only descendants of this Mr. Tyler. He had children \u2014 he married later and had a couple of children, but they all died without issue. So if he was our forefather than we are the only ones. He lives on through you. Yeah. I also read that interview in Image, which was wonderful, which was referenced, and they asked you about the years in which you were teaching, writing, parenting a child at the same time. And I just want to read what you said. You said, \u201CMy book Mama\u2019s Promises describes a lot of my experience during that period. I came up for early tenure in an almost exclusively white, male English department when my son was about fifteen months old. I was unhappily married, new to the community, and had few friends. Though I had published a book of poems with a major university press, and had poems in several major press anthologies of younger American poets, I had to fight for my life because my colleagues considered poetry inferior to literary criticism. I spent several years writing poems at three am because I had to do class preparations first. I went to the ER several times with heart palpitations caused by stress. Meanwhile, my mother was disappearing into Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201D And then you said, \u201CI would not want to relive that period of my life. But I kept thinking of my great-great-grandmothers.\u201D Yes. I kept thinking if they could live through what they lived through, I can live through a tenure decision. Piece of cake. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the storytelling poet Marilyn Nelson. I want to talk about your understanding of the relationship between poetry and silence. You said poetry comes out of silence. Would you talk about that? Yes, I think poetry comes out of silence and leads us back to silence. It should, I think, lead us back to silence. Silence is the source of so much of what we need to get through our lives. And poetry consists of words and phrases and sentences that emerge like something coming out of water. They emerge before us, and they call up something in us, but then they turn us back into our own silence. They \u2014 it\u2019s a gift, in a way. It\u2019s a gift out of a kind of universal silence that takes us into a private silence, I think. And that\u2019s why reading poetry, reading it alone silently takes us someplace where we can\u2019t get ordinarily. Poetry opens us to this otherness that exists within us. In any case, I think poetry and the silence of the inner life are related, are connected and that \u2014 don\u2019t you think? You read a poem, and you say, \u201CAh.\u201D And then you listen to what it brings out inside of you. And what it is is not words; it\u2019s silence. So, yes. I wonder if that\u2019s one way to talk about what\u2019s happening when \u2014 I mean, my experience when we put poets on the air is that people respond like they were starved for this and they didn\u2019t know it. And you\u2019re very winsome about how you love technology in many ways, and yet, the presence of technology and the pace of our lives makes silence this endangered thing that we do have to intentionally create it, create spaces for the possibility of it. And I don\u2019t think that was always true in human history. Oh, I think it\u2019s more and more difficult to find silence. You go anyplace, restaurant, an airport, and people are all figuring out ways to fill up the silence with some kind of technology. They\u2019re listening on earphones. They\u2019re looking at smartphones. And I think this is a terrible thing. It frightens me. I think we\u2019ve become afraid of silence. Well, it\u2019s not necessarily a comfortable thing, right? So the technology is there to rush into that \u2014 meet the discomfort. But I mean, so you actually have \u2014 you\u2019ve worked with contemplative practices with your teaching. And maybe that\u2019s partly what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re helping people sink into that, or that\u2019s one thing contemplative practices do for us. Yes. And I think people are starved for that too. The times that I\u2019ve offered a few minutes of meditation at the beginning of a class. Just say we come into a classroom out of who knows what. We come into a classroom, and then we are immediately starting to talk about something. Let\u2019s not bring all of the noise of the outside world into this classroom. Let\u2019s release it and enter into silence. And I\u2019ve had students love doing that. Nobody\u2019s offered them \u2014 has been quite a lot of recent research about the effect of contemplation, meditation, silence. Right. The research has caught up with you now. Yeah. How much it enhances the learning experience. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to offer students in my classrooms. I\u2019ve had a lot of wonderful, beautiful results. So I\u2019m really intrigued that you \u2014 was West Point one of the places you started doing this? Yeah, that was the first thing I did. Yes. And so you said there was a \u2014 you got a contemplative practices fellowship \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure what that means \u2014 right as you were starting to teach at the U.S. military academy at West Point. So, I mean, tell us about that experience. It\u2019s an organization called the Center for Contemplative Life, Contemplative Mind and Society. Shortly \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I applied for the fellowship, and then I was invited to West Point to do a reading. And after the reading, they asked me if I would be interested in teaching there. And I think the next day, I got the news that I had won this fellowship. So I said, \u201CI\u2019ve won this fellowship.\u201D And they said, \u201CBring it here. Do it here.\u201D So I wound up teaching two sections of a course on poetry and meditation to cadets at West Point. It was \u2014 it makes me want to cry. It was an absolutely wonderful experience. I loved the cadets. We would come into the classroom, close the door, turn off the lights, and meditate for five minutes at the beginning of the class. And then I asked them to meditate for 15 or 20 minutes every day outside of class, which was very hard for them. Their lives are scheduled. Every minute is scheduled. Finding 10 or 15 minutes and a quiet place was really a stretch for them. But they did it, and they kept journals. And their journals showed so much growth during the course of that semester. And I loved them. I remember we made up mantras to meditate with. One of them made up a mantra, \u201CTo swim in a heartbeat of clouds.\u201D Yes. So yeah, it was a\u2026 I was also really intrigued that \u2014 it sounds like you coupled that \u2014 like, you explored also where that takes people and you use words like \u201Cmusings\u201D and \u201Ccommunal pondering,\u201D that in those classes, you ended up having these conversations about Just War Theory that came \u2014 that probably would\u2019ve been very different if the conversation hadn\u2019t started in that silent, grounded, contemplative place. Even the notion \u2014 I mean, the phrase \u201Ccommunal pondering,\u201D I feel like that\u2019s what we need as a nation right now. Right? We have no idea how to do that, but it sounds so fascinating. It\u2019s maybe one of the things we\u2019re doing in poetry readings. I just was, last night, at the Dodge Festival, Geraldine Dodge Poetry Festival in Newark. And the chancellors of the Academy of American Poets read last night. There are 12 chancellors so 12 readings, each \u2014 I think each reading was seven minutes. It was communal pondering. The poets were different. The voices were different. And every one of the poems took us someplace that brought something out of us, from poems about \u2014 I remember Mark Doty read a poem about his \u2014 he writes a lot about dogs, so we had a couple of dog poems. We had poems about grandparents. We had poems about losing friends. We had Anne Waldman who read a Tibetan \u2014 it was her own poem, but it was based on a Tibetan Buddhist chant, I think. It was wonderful, and it was a way of sitting and pondering together. And I think it\u2019s a very rewarding activity. One of my college professors said that poetry rediscovers reality for us. And in a way, that\u2019s what happens. You go to listen to a poet, and you leave not only having learned something about the poet\u2019s reality, but also having learned something about the reality you are living. And I guess that\u2019s what communal pondering is. To that point \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this is something you\u2019re aware of \u2014 we found this blog post that was written actually by a professor who had just gotten back from sabbatical, and she was dusting her office. Have you read this? I mean, this is the things you can find on the internet. This is the upside of the internet. Is your poem, \u201CDusting?\u201D Mm-hmm. It\u2019s a small poem. I don\u2019t know if this is the whole thing. You want to read it? Oh, she put it on her blog? She put it on her blog, so I\u2019m going to \u2014 I\u2019ll read what she wrote. She wrote \u2014 the blog title was \u201CThe Spiritual Case For Dust.\u201D But why don\u2019t you read it, and then I\u2019ll read what she said. OK. It\u2019s a part of it. I don\u2019t remember\u2026 It\u2019s just a part of it? \u201CThank you for these tiny / particles of ocean salt, / pearl-necklace viruses / winged protozoans: / for the infinite / intricate shapes / of submicroscopic / living things.\u201D And she wrote, \u201CNelson\u2019s poem and my dusty office reminds me that the unpolished and ordinary is cloaked in the extraordinary. Even as I settle back into my everyday life, in that dust, tiny tokens of the universe have settled into my office. Should I be able to sort through the motes, I expect I would find fragments brushed from the cliffs in Ireland blown into the air by storms in the Pacific, and burnt off comets that blundered into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Crumbs of the infinite lie scattered across my desk. I\u2019m suddenly hesitant to pick up my dust rag and wipe it all away.\u201D Yes, I read someplace that dust is one of the cleanest things on the planet, and we \u2014 yeah. You can wash in dust and that we can\u2019t have rain without dust. Dust seeds clouds so that rain happens. We wouldn\u2019t have rain without dust, which I think is beautiful. And that dust is full of life, that the things listed in my poem are things that are in dust, that dust is alive. Sharon Olds, a really terrific poet, told me once that she had named the dust bunnies in her house. Yeah, we need to do that. You can listen again and share this conversation with Marilyn Nelson through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, as Americans young and old are reaching for poetry with a new intensity, I\u2019m with the storytelling poet Marilyn Nelson. She\u2019s taught poetry and contemplative practice to West Point cadets. She commands gentle but mighty esteem in the communion of modern poets, and she\u2019s a voice for all of us in the work and privilege of what she calls \u201Ccommunal pondering.\u201D So contemplative prayer is part of your life. Is that right? Is it? Well, yes, I\u2019m more of a backslider than\u2026 OK, OK. Well, let\u2019s say it\u2019s something you\u2019re drawn \u2014 you\u2019ve been drawn to. Would that be fair? I have been drawn to it, yes. And my friend, who is a former monk and who travels around teaching meditation\u2026 Is this Father Abba Jacob. Abba. Yes. He\u2019s a pretty intriguing character in your writing. He is a very intriguing character. He says that meditation, after you\u2019ve practiced, it\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s not \u2014 you don\u2019t have to sit in a certain way and hold your hands in a certain way. It\u2019s an attitude. You look at the world with this attitude. In a similar way, I was thinking today, earlier, about methods of prayer, which I\u2019ve found just beautiful and meaningful. One of them is the prayer of just gratitude, just feeling grateful. And one of them is a prayer I found in a book by a nun who lives as a hermit. I don\u2019t remember her name or the name of the book. But she offers a kind of prayer which she calls the prayer of the loving gaze. It\u2019s a prayer. Just put your love into your eyes and just look at the world with that gaze and that\u2019s what contemplation is about, really. It\u2019s learning how to find that gaze in yourself and to put it in the world. I\u2019d love to delve into Abba Jacob a little bit. So he\u2019s a real person. He sounds like a desert father when you \u2014 right, even Abba Jacob, calling him that. Yeah. Well, that was\u2026 He sounds like one of these hermits who could\u2019ve been living in the deserts of Egypt. Yes. Well, the first time I visited him \u2014 he\u2019s someone I met when we were in college together. And 20 years later, I found him living as a hermit, and I went to visit and\u2026 Oh, you were at college with him? We were in college together. Really? Yeah, we met 50 years ago. I mean, you have all these \u2014 this is in this collection, Faster Than Light: New and Selected Poems. You have kind of an Abba Jacob section here called \u201CHow To Be Human Now,\u201D which is also just such a wonderful line. I guess it\u2019s from Auden. \u201CTo discover how to be human now / is the reason we follow the star.\u201D Here\u2019s another \u2014 here\u2019s one \u2014 I want to ask you about this, another poem you wrote about him. \u201CAbba Jacob said: / There\u2019s a big difference between / the mentalities of magic and of alliance. / People who spend their lives searching for God have a magical mentality: / They need a sign, a proof, / a puff of smoke, an irrefutable miracle. / People who have an alliance mentality / know God by loving.\u201D I\u2019m really intrigued by that phrase, \u201Can alliance mentality.\u201D What do you mean by that? I think people who have a \u201Cmagic mentality\u201D believe that God is something out there that we have to find to connect with and people who have an \u201Calliance mentality\u201D know that God is inside of us and in our connections with each other and with the world, that God exists within and between, not exterior to us, but within us and between us. I think that\u2019s what he was trying to say. So we are allied with whatever God is. Yes. And with everything we\u2019re part of. Yes. There is no separation. We are a part of God. That\u2019s \u2014 isn\u2019t that the ecstatic experience? We recognize that. And some people know that just naturally. Other people have to learn it. I wonder if you\u2019d read a couple of poems. There\u2019s a poem in here called \u201CFarm Garden,\u201D which just struck me. Is it in that book? It\u2019s in this one. Yeah. It\u2019s \u201CLyric Histories.\u201D Is it about George Washington Carver? You have said that that \u2014 writing about George Washington Carver changed you. Yes. No, this isn\u2019t from Carver. And that did change me, but \u2014 it really did. But why? What was it about that? I had been writing a series of poems about radical evil. And I could see that whatever we discover, whatever evil weapon we discover, somebody\u2019s going to use it. There is no limit to our capacity for evil. And I wanted to look at a saint\u2019s life to ask whether there is any limit to our human capacity for good. And Carver\u2019s life showed that capacity. He lived what he believed. He lived his faith. And I believe he was a saint. But this poem here is from a different project. It\u2019s about the life of Venture Smith, who was enslaved in Connecticut in the 18th century. He was captured as a boy in, I think, Ghana, brought to North America as a slave, served for about 30 years under several different masters in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York. And then he purchased his own freedom, and then he purchased his children and his wife, and then he went into the freedom business, saving up money and setting people \u2014 buying people so he could set them free. So this is from his life. \u201CBy the time I was thirty-six I had been sold / three times. I had spun money out of sweat. / I\u2019d been cheated and beaten. I had paid an enormous sum / for my freedom. And ten years farther on I\u2019ve come / out here to my garden at the first faint hint of light / to inventory the riches I now hold. / My potatoes look fine and my corn, my squash, my beans. / My tobacco is strutting, spreading its velvety wings. / My cabbages are almost as big as my head. / From labor and luck, I have much profited. / I wish I could remember those praise-songs / we used to dance to, with the sacred drums. / My rooster is calling my hens from my stone wall. / In my meadow, my horses and my cows look up, / then graze again. My orchard boasts green fruit. / Yes, everything I own is dearly bought, / but gratitude is a never-emptying cup, / my life equal measures pain and windfall. / My effigies to scare raccoons and crows / frown fiercely, wearing a clattering fringe of shells, / like dancers in the whatdidwecallit? dance. / My wife and two of my children stir in my house. / For one thirty years enslaved, I have done well. / I am free and clear; not one penny do I owe. / I own myself\u2014a five-hundred-dollar man\u2014 / and two thousand dollars\u2019 worth of family. / Of canoes and boats, right now I own twenty-nine. / Seventy acres of bountiful land is mine. / God or gods, thanks for raining these blessings on me. / I turn around slowly. I own everything I scan.\u201D So the narrative of Venture Smith\u2019s life was published in, I think, 1795. It\u2019s one of the rare stories in African-American history. This family, Venture Smith\u2019s descendants, have been free for eight and nine generations. There is an annual Venture Smith Day in East Haddam, Connecticut at the Congregational Church he belonged to and is buried in the cemetery there. Now, there are scholars who are coming to talk about new discoveries of his life, and his descendants come. Last year, or maybe the year before, Venture Smith\u2019s descendants went to Ghana to the castle he remembered being shipped out of. They were there, nine generations free. It\u2019s such a wonderful story. And it\u2019s what American history could have been. It could have been that way. But this is a man who did this for himself. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the storytelling poet Marilyn Nelson. Somewhere you said, \u201CThere are so many interesting stories. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t write about all of them.\u201D And I think we get that. And there\u2019s so many stories that you\u2019ve written about \u2014 you wrote a children\u2019s book about Emmett Till, but really also about his mother. I mean, there\u2019s so many stories, your own from your own family and other families. I wonder, through all of this, and this is a vast question, but how you would just start to answer, like how your sense has evolved, how you think about what it means to be human, what this life in poetry and storytelling has taught you about that. I think I\u2019ve become more open to history, to other people\u2019s histories. When I started, I was writing about my own life and the life of my family. The last two projects I\u2019ve done have taken me quite a distance away from those interests. One of the two most recently published books I\u2019ve written are \u2014 one of them is a history of the first 200 years of the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, Connecticut. Old Lyme, Connecticut is a community that has been populated for the \u2014 probably the last at least 120 years by the families of sea captains, whaling captains. It was a very prosperous community. And this Congregational Church started in that way. It was founded in 1666, and the first church divided the congregation with the women and girls sitting in the front, and men sitting behind them, and then boys and servants and slaves sitting in the back. That\u2019s how it began. The first minister of the church raised his children with the help of Arabella, his slave. That\u2019s where it started. And working with this specific history of a prosperous New England town, seemed to me to be teaching me something about our nation, where we started, what we\u2019ve gone through, the wrenching of our history. And this church now, 350 years after its founding, with the first minister keeping slaves in the attic of the parsonage \u2014 one of the ministers took off for a year off of his ministry to go and fight the Niantic Indians. This community now has a relationship with the Lakota community in North Dakota, so there are people going back and forth from the church and the reservation every year. They have a relationship with the only tuition-free private school in Harlem. I mean, this is a community that has learned how to be what they have always thought they were, but couldn\u2019t see. But then, you know they had to learn. In the last 80 or 100 years, they\u2019ve learned how to be a church, a true church in the course of this 350 years. They really had to struggle. They really had to struggle. What does it mean? How do we live out the faith we claim? How do we bring it into the world? And it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not easy. There are always people who want the safe route, who think that doing unto others means doing unto others who are like you. But working, trying to struggle with real history has been a way to learn something about who we are, I think, less personally, less who I am than who we are as a nation. What are we doing here? And how is it that we have managed to persist in the blindnesses that we started out with? How are we back to our campaign? How are we able to lie to ourselves like that? Yeah. But what I think the stories you\u2019re investigating and telling are also true about what we\u2019re capable of. And it\u2019s important that we see the fullness of what\u2019s possible. I think so, yes. The good stories, the stories of people who do something wonderful, but ordinary. And people do wonderful things and then they say, \u201CI only did what seemed like the obvious thing. I didn\u2019t really choose.\u201D But most people don\u2019t make choices like that. And I think we do, we need to tell their stories. We need to learn about people who are willing to put their lives on the line. And we just had a conversation earlier today about one of these cell phone videos that was made in Edina, Minnesota in which an African American man is walking down the sidewalk. There was some kind of construction blocking the sidewalk, so he walked out into the street to go around the blockage, and a cop immediately stopped him and grabbed him and started pushing him around. And there was a woman there who \u2014 you could hear in the voice. I visualize this woman. It\u2019s a middle-aged, white, Minnesota woman. She gets out of her car. She starts recording this, and then she says, \u201CBut officer, I think you should \u2014 I think that you\u2019re being unfair. I think you should help him,\u201D in a kind of timid way, but she spoke up. This man could have been dead. He could easily have been dead for walking down the street. And I want people to know the story of this woman. That was a heroic thing she did. And yeah. So, I think we need to be telling these stories. And I think it also \u2014 it\u2019s just an illustration of the ordinary interwoven with the extraordinary, which is really such a theme that runs all the way through your writing. There\u2019s a poem that you wrote after Rilke, who I also love, which I think is in \u2014 it\u2019s in the Fields of Praise book, page 152. Maybe you could read that to close. It\u2019s just lovely and quite \u2014 it\u2019s another one of your voices. Oh, all right. This is \u201CLovesong.\u201D \u201CHow shall I hold my spirit, that it not touch yours? / How shall I send it soaring past / your height into the patient waiting there / above you? Oh, if only I could shut / it up, leave it to gather velvet dust / someplace where it would echo you no more. / But like two strings vibrating as the bow / ripples them with a long caressing stroke, / we tremble, drawn together by one joy. / What instrument is this? Whose fingers make / a chord beyond our capacity for awe? / How sweet, how: Ah!\u201D Thank you.
