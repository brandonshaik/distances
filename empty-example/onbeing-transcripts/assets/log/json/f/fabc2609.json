  "fullText": "Of all the arts, singing is the most companionable. So says Alice Parker, a composer, conductor, and teacher who\u2019s been shaping the universe of chorale music for most of her 90 years. She began as a young woman, studying conducting with Robert Shaw at Juilliard, and collaborated with him on arrangements of folksongs, spirituals, and hymns that are still performed around the world today. Alice Parker is also a gorgeous thinker and writer, a wise and joyful woman, about why singing is able to touch and join human beings in ways few other arts can. I think each one of us is a walking encyclopedia of all the sounds we\u2019ve ever heard in our lives. And it takes color, or a representational object, or an occurrence, or remembering the first love, all those things. What they call forth, the kind of communication they call forth is music. Trying to get them in words is loads of fun. It\u2019s a marvelous game trying to pin these things down. And the lovely thing with the music is that we don\u2019t have to be limited by the way that words are limited by our rational minds. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Alice Parker has composed operas, cantatas, and suites for chamber ensembles, as well as hundreds of anthems and songs. She is Artistic Director of the non-profit Melodious Accord. She was born in 1925 in Boston, Massachusetts. I just want to say before we start that although you are all about music, and composing, and singing, and conducting, you write beautifully about it. I love words. Right. And so I have made so many notes, and I have so many quotations from you. You\u2019ve written, \u201CSong is a right and need.\u201D And I just wondered if there were roots of that. I would say it probably started as an intuition, and I think now it\u2019s a conviction. I think that\u2019s\u2026 Are there \u2014 how do you trace the roots of that in you? I think it\u2019s mostly from being a mother. And I was 30 when I got married and had children. And so I\u2019d been teaching for almost ten years then and\u2026 You\u2019d been with the Robert Shaw Chorale\u2026 Yes, yes. \u2026already. Yes. And watching those tiny babies develop, it just gave me this absolute conviction that babies \u2014 that\u2019s the language of babies. That\u2019s what they\u2019re born knowing. From their first utterance, it\u2019s all singing. And it takes a long time to learn the language, learn the words, and how to communicate from their brain. And there was nothing that I loved that I could sing to them that they didn\u2019t love and sing back because the trade that\u2019s going on is not learning a song; it is human communication at its most elemental level, from the mother to baby, wordless hum or something like that. Which also leads me to conclude that song predates language, and that the first way that humans communicate is with vocal sound, which is much closer to song than it is to thought-out, measured, rational language. Sentences. Bobby McFerrin once said to me \u2014 he said he suspected that we sang before we spoke. I\u2019m certain that that\u2019s true. Because we do \u2014 we talk a lot, and there\u2019s a lot of study of how we learn language and the kind of elemental template in us, however that functions. And for you to point out which \u2014 we don\u2019t need any scientist to prove this to us, right? That singing also emerges, that sound emerges just as naturally. It\u2019s a possession almost. It is. It\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re born with. And it\u2019s the great international, inter-everything language because it\u2019s dealing with our inner emotional life. It\u2019s as if singing is the language of the emotions. And it\u2019s our intuitive life as opposed to our rational life. And we live in a society that has glorified rationality. I sense that you perceive that \u2014 that that move to \u2014 I kind of think, in the 21st century, the place we\u2019ve come is that we\u2019re understanding that even things we\u2019ve pretended were rational aren\u2019t. Yes. Like economic behavior, political behavior\u2026 Absolutely. These things we\u2019ve called sciences. But I kind of \u2014 I sense that you see \u2014 that that moved kind of \u2014 idolizing, preferencing what can be rational has also taken us away from singing. It\u2019s partial. It\u2019s a partial view of reality. I have a basic division kind of thing that I make between what I call God-made and what is man-made. And if God made it \u2014 which is the whole created universe, sound, and all the things that are in it, or man-made. And because man is imperfect, everything that we do is not whole. I think different people\u2019s ideas of defining God, of course, are very different, but it\u2019s the creative force for me. It\u2019s what began things if things began. And it\u2019s the all-encompassing view. Wendell Berry has a wonderful poem about the natural world where he talks of a complete economy where every bit is accounted for. What we don\u2019t account for in our economy at all is waste. And there\u2019s so much of it. Before we buy anything, we should have money allocated for taking care of that product when it is past its useful time, like our buildings and our cars and everything, so that we don\u2019t think in wholes. And for me, the intuitive mind comes much closer to thinking in wholes than the rational mind because the rational mind erects walls. It defines. And the minute you define, you exclude something as well as include it. If we\u2019re intuitively in music, the kind of thing that can happen at a concert where there\u2019s a person singing a spiritual from their soul \u2014 and they may have just been doing gorgeous art song and symphonic Arias, operatic Arias and things like that, but nothing goes straight to the heart of the audience like that one voice with that one song. So my question then is, \u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D And I try to define it in my book about melody. And I always \u2014 when I go into a class, as I did this morning, I said, \u201CHow many people here have had a course in melody?\u201D Not one hand ever goes up. And that\u2019s the thing that we begin with as babies, as children. OK. Well, let\u2019s talk about that because that is one of your themes. Yes. Melody and \u2014 how do you say it? That at some point we started to preference harmony over melody. But I think you just \u2014 you say again and again that melody is elemental\u2026 Harmony is a subset of melody. Right. And I mean, I don\u2019t even think most of us have ever thought any of this through, right? Or have any sense of this. Most people are just astonished when I say that because it\u2019s melody and harmony and rhythm. Right? That\u2019s what music is. But harmony doesn\u2019t develop until you have \u2014 four centuries ago, five centuries ago, harmony as we define it in our traditional practice. And it doesn\u2019t develop until there\u2019s notation. And notation, our notation doesn\u2019t develop until maybe, I can say, 1200 or during the Dark Ages that people begin to write down chant and stuff like that. But as it begins to be more and more precise, we write down what we hear, and that limits it. Any notated piece of music is so severely limited by the fact of putting it down in those dumb black blobs on the paper. Right. I think you\u2019ve said that \u2014 what did you say? Like, that 5 percent of what you hear and what you\u2019re composing is what gets put down on paper. You\u2019re just condensing, just leaving off all of this other stuff. You can\u2019t notate the emotion. You can\u2019t \u2014 you can notate the words. This is also true of language, and I\u2019m sure that the first people that notated language were just as horrified at what gets left out because the tone of voice. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the composer, conductor, and writer Alice Parker. So, I want to understand why it matters that we take this in, like what difference it makes. Also, just in terms of how any of us move through the world, whether we have perfect pitch or are tone deaf or had never read a note, why does that matter, understanding the primacy of melody? It\u2019s the language \u2014 as I said before, it\u2019s the language of emotions. It\u2019s the way \u2014 if you think of a tiny baby, what does it have the possibility of doing? It has the possibility of a cry, which is the first one, which is for attention, for what it needs. And then very quickly, it has the ability to please, to register not only pleasure but delight. Watching a tiny baby laugh is just one of life\u2019s great moments. So that we\u2019re communicating, not what the words mean, because you can\u2019t read Shakespeare to a tiny baby. But you can certainly read Shakespeare to a 2-year-old, and what they get is the flavor of the voice. The voice is a part of us much as our physical appearance is, and the customs that we have, the way we use our bodies. So I don\u2019t wish my grandfather had any other voice. I remember him singing to me in a very kind of scratchy voice. But that means grandpa, the way he sounded. So we each have a sound. And we communicate emotional states through that sound that are impossible to get at any other medium. It\u2019s deep. Sound gives us what is behind the surface. Sight gives us the surface. What we miss when we don\u2019t have song is the means of creating a community, of creating a whole out of a group of people. And it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a group of people in an old folk\u2019s home that can\u2019t really sing anymore, or if it\u2019s a kindergarten classroom, or a nursery school classroom, or a bunch of seventh-grade boys who can be fairly hard to get to function as a unit. Wherever they are, if you get them on a song, you can establish a kind of group feeling that is really \u2014 well, it\u2019s exemplified at its most marvelous after a perfectly wonderful concert when the last note is sound, and you get that silence in the room, which is a silence of completion, which is opposite from an anticipatory silence. But it just means that everyone \u2014 it\u2019s as if all of our inner ions have been scheduled to be moving in the same direction at the same time. That\u2019s just so true. Right, right. Yeah. You say somewhere that, I think, singing is the most companionable of arts. That\u2019s also just a wonderful way to think of it. And it\u2019s an art that\u2019s there for all of us too. For everyone. And we\u2019ve \u2014 well, I hope most of us have had that experience you just described, if even briefly, right? Well, and it can be from other things too. It can be from hearing \u2014 the memory of the songs that your grandmother loved or something like that. I mean, memory works in such amazing ways, the depth of our sound melody. I think each one of us is a walking encyclopedia of all the sounds we\u2019ve ever heard in our lives. And it takes a sympathetic vibration, kind of light glinting off something, or a color, or a representational object, or an occurrence, or remembering the first love or \u2014 all those things. What they call forth, the kind of communication they call forth is music. Trying to get them in words is loads of fun. It\u2019s a marvelous game trying to pin these things down. But the really important things that you\u2019re always talking about just defy definition. And the lovely thing with the music is that we don\u2019t have to be limited by the way that words are limited by our rational minds. I love that. There\u2019s this beautiful thing you say. You talk about the human qualities of song, that it does not exist until it is incarnate in the human throat. Now, I grew up Southern Baptist in Oklahoma, and it was a culture where there was a lot of singing in church. Of course. The church was at the center of a culture. And then there were choirs, and this was a craft that was really valued and cultivated. And there was a Baptist University where I grew up, Oklahoma Baptist University. It had an outstanding music department. In that experience I had growing up, I did know \u2014 have the experience of the kind of magic and mystery of people singing together. And I mean, you are a choral conductor, and there are choirs all over the world. Now, are you 91 now? Mm-hmm. Well, I\u2019ll be 91 in two months. OK. So in your 90th year, so this is still going on. There are all these choirs all over the country, possibly all over the world, singing music that you\u2019ve arranged and composed, and putting them up on YouTube. It\u2019s so joyful to listen to that. It made me so happy to \u2014 it was such a happy thing to prepare for this conversation. I also think unlike, let\u2019s say, conducting an orchestra, there\u2019s something quite mysterious about how a good choir conductor or leader \u2014 well let\u2019s say it this way: somebody who\u2019s not great at what they do can be working with a wonderful collection of human voices, and the sound is not pleasing. Right. But I\u2019ve also seen this \u2014 my son was in a great choir program at his high school \u2014 how somebody who has that craft can take a collection of very ordinary people, some \u2014 many of whom have no training, maybe all of them have no training, probably a fair number of any group like that is tone deaf, and yet make a gorgeous noise. There\u2019s something very mysterious about that, but\u2026 It is. I mean, that\u2019s a lot of where you\u2019ve spent your energy and your creativity. I do, because I\u2026 So what is that? Because you couldn\u2019t do that with people playing instruments, right? You need everybody to have a modicum of expertise. That\u2019s right. And it also \u2014 you have to overcome technical difficulties in the beginning. But I\u2019ve always said I\u2019ve never found a group that couldn\u2019t sing in a very conservative church down south, or wherever they are, a classroom. In any place there\u2019s a group of singing, where two or three are gathered together, we can sing. And it doesn\u2019t even take that. I sing by myself all the time, as if I am both a producer of sound and listener to the sounds. So the circle is complete. But what\u2019s happening is that \u2014 if I just make it personal again \u2014 I have a conception of the sound of the song, what the life of this song is. And my understanding is that if we have ears, the realm of music is open to us. If I, in my own training, start out singing in church, and was a child, and loving the music, and having piano lessons, and gradually learning more about it, I\u2019m enlarging the capability of imagining sound that is suggested by a page. So that the more different kind of sounds that I have experienced, the more different sounds I have at my fingertips to use in my own craft. I don\u2019t think we make up anything. I think it\u2019s all there and we discover it in the world, exactly as a painter\u2026 We discover the music? Yeah. Well \u2014 as a painter discovers color. I know red, green, all those things, but I can\u2019t remember a color and reproduce it somewhere else. And I can with music. And if I am absolutely convinced that the possibility of song is always there, no matter where I am, and my job is to birth it. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s floating around right here. And if I start to sing with my very failing voice, I can evoke that spirit. And if I do it gently enough, I can get anybody that\u2019s around me into joining me just by going like this: \u201CHelp me. Help. I\u2019m on my own.\u201D And the more that we listen to each other, the more wonderful the sound is. And, for instance, my little church congregation at home, we have to have 40 or 50 people in the room for the congregation. The choir is about 12. But they have learned over the years to let me line out a song, a brand new song to them, and sing it back, hear what I\u2019m doing. And I hardly ever repeat or go back unless there\u2019s a real difficulty, but I want to solve that right then. So I repeat\u2026 And so this lining is this \u2014 you call this technique you use. Lining out, yes. And so just explain that or demonstrate it. Yeah, so it\u2019s just \u2014 if I\u2019m going to teach a song, as I was just doing with the university choirs, if I take, \u201CLet your little light shine, shine, shine.\u201D And you can\u2019t \u2014 if one is written down, it looks like [singing] \u201CLet your little light shine, shine, shine.\u201D And that\u2019s the way somebody who\u2019s reading music sounds. But if you have this other one, and you\u2019re trying to get over an idea \u2014 and it\u2019s always \u2014 it\u2019s a dramatic idea. It\u2019s an opera scene. It\u2019s a video. It\u2019s something \u2014 [singing] \u201CLet your little light shine, shine, shine. Let your little light shine, oh my Lord. There might be someone down in the valley trying to get home. So let your little light\u2026\u201D And I get this picture in my mind of the only way that that person is going to get out of that valley of whatever it is that they\u2019re going through is because my light is shining, because nobody else is around here at the moment that can do it. So you start thinking that way. See where we are? It\u2019s almost in tears. Yeah, there\u2019s something you wrote: \u201CSomehow, in music, you get exactly what you ask for and no more.\u201D Yeah. And that\u2019s what you \u2014 but you are calling forth \u2014 really what you\u2019re calling forth is that natural gift and the fullness of the humanity that has been accumulated alongside that. Exactly. Yeah, it has nothing to do with music from Mars or anything like that. It has to \u2014 or with music divorced from emotion. It has to do with the fact that the walls that we put up around ourselves in order to get through growing up in polite society and stuff simply dissolve when we are all listening together to a song, and when we\u2019ve called forth the emotional underpinning of that song, the context out of which the song arises. And the sound can be vastly different as it comes from different groups and develop in vastly different ways. But I am not happy unless the group I am singing with is always in that emotional connection. I have no patience with learning the notes. OK. You learn them by hearing them and always keeping the emotional quality there. You can listen again and share this conversation with Alice Parker through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the composer and conductor Alice Parker. She\u2019s best known for her 20-year collaboration with the Robert Shaw Chorale and her arrangements of folksongs, spirituals, and hymns that are performed around the world. She\u2019s also composed operas, cantatas, and suites for chamber ensembles, and hundreds of anthems and songs. Now in her 90s, she is also a gorgeous thinker and writer about singing as the most companionable of the arts \u2014 \u201Csong as a right and a need\u201D for us as humans and in our life together. I want to talk a little bit about your imagination about the physical properties of sound because this is also something you\u2019ve thought a lot about, worked with \u2014 how tones are produced, how tones strike the ear, time, vibration, energy, the physics of motion. Just talk to me about what goes through Alice Parker\u2019s mind when she hears the word \u201Csound.\u201D Define. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s vibration. And if you think back to \u2014 I\u2019d have to try to go back to beginnings, the Big Bang, except I can\u2019t really quite imagine the Big Bang. And God moved upon the face of the waters, right? Smack in the beginning of Genesis. If you\u2019re moving on the face of the waters, you\u2019re creating vibration. There\u2019s a wonderful Native American creation story that starts, \u201CIn the beginning was the sound.\u201D And in a way, I think that\u2019s very true, except light is also vibration. We learn that all of the little molecules and everything in our bodies are in constant motion; they\u2019re all vibrating. So vibration is almost at the center of life. And we can experience it through all of our different senses. But if we have ears, music is the kind of glorification of the possibility of hearing. That that\u2019s where it all is, and that that\u2019s the gift that is given us. And it partakes of energy exactly the way the physical world does. Every time we start a song, we\u2019re setting something in motion. And it keeps going. Once we get it started, it\u2019s fairly easy to keep it going if we remember the words and aren\u2019t stopped in some way. But then how do you stop it? How do you connect one verse to the next verse? What\u2019s the emotional line through this piece? Where is the moment of most intensity? Where\u2019s the climax? How high is that climax, and how are you going to get down from it? But you\u2019re dealing with this energy, and it\u2019s when you don\u2019t realize it, what you\u2019re doing, is that you get the boring performance or the performance that everything is technically right, but it just doesn\u2019t happen because you\u2019re not riding that energy. Yeah. I think somewhere you talk about what \u2014 songs that have lasted, that have proven themselves, which is true of folk songs, it\u2019s true of a lot of religious music, they carry accumulated emotion, not just the imagination of one poet or one text. Yeah. And kind of, as you said, generation upon generation has recreated that majesty, that loveliness and worked with it. Right. Yeah. That\u2019s a wonderful quote. Yes. Which is an interesting way to think about how music can work on us, how we will turn to music \u2014 I mean, to even to use the word \u201Cmood\u201D superficially \u2014 when we don\u2019t \u2014 when we want to feel something different. Right? Yes. Or want to be taken outside. Right, exactly. And it does that for me all of the time. If I\u2019m going to bed at night, and my head \u2014 I always have music playing in my head. It drives me crazy sometimes. And the only way I can turn it off is play other music. OK. But I\u2019ve got \u2014 my head is all in a jangle because so many things have happened, and there\u2019s unresolved issues in my life or relationships or whatever like that. And if I go to bed and put on a recording of Gregorian chant, or of string quartets, or something like that \u2014 it can\u2019t be with words because I have a different way of listening to them. I get caught up in the words and in the technical things of that. But chant \u2014 and then I absolutely love guitar music, the gentler instruments and the quieter things. Or if I\u2019ve heard a whole lot of late romantic music with big orchestra and lots of big sounds since I was \u2014 kind of run and hide for a while in much quieter songs. And I\u2019ve gotten much bolder about writing fewer notes for people to sing, so the music gets sparer and sparer. So there\u2019s space around it to get that quality of listening that comes from when you\u2019re just listening to one line, or two people sharing a song back and forth. It\u2019s kind of interesting. I spoke with Mary Oliver this year, and one thing she said about \u2014 as she goes through her life, her poetry becomes shorter, sparer. Yes. That\u2019s\u2026 What is that? What is that about the passage of time? I sometimes think about aging. That as we\u2019re born, everything is new. So we have all of this experiences we have to go through to begin to have some idea of about what\u2019s going on. So you have all these learning years, and in your teens, you\u2019re beginning to learn about relationships with other people, and emotions, and all that that leads to. Then you\u2019re 20 to 50 \u2014 maybe 20 to 60, you are so caught up in the business of living, in the business of being a parent, in the business of being a teacher, or whatever your occupation is, that you don\u2019t have time to look at it as a whole. And it seems to me, I was about 60 when I began to see my own experiences adding up to me instead of being very diverse experiences in conducting, and composing, and teaching, and mothering, and all the rest of it. And so it\u2019s as if before then I\u2019ve been in this going \u2014 living through this miasma, this series of scenes and acts that are just so full of activity there\u2019s no time to think. And when you begin to get out of it, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re putting your head up above water, and you\u2019re looking out and saying, \u201COh, is that the way it works?\u201D When your doctor is younger than you are, when the policeman is younger than you are, the authority figures that you\u2019ve looked up to \u2014 all of a sudden they\u2019re your children, or are the age of your grandchildren. And you just see differently. So that your vision gets farther, and you begin to see how things relate in a way that you can\u2019t when you\u2019re right in the middle of them. That sounds wonderful. And then you\u2019ve had 30 years to live that way. I see \u2014 it\u2019s just such a gift. It is such a gift, and I\u2019ve just \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go back and change anything else that happened because that\u2019s all part of what brought me here. I want to actually read \u2014 you have wonderful quotes all the way through. This quote of Martin Luther \u2014 where was it? About \u2014 something about all of nature has its sound. \u201CThere is nothing on earth that hath not its tone. Even the air invisible sings when smitten with a staff.\u201D Yes. Isn\u2019t that lovely? Yes. And then here\u2019s another one, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel: \u201CListening to great music is a shattering experience, throwing the soul into an encounter with an aspect of reality to which the mind can never relate itself adequately. Such experiences undermine conceit and complacency and may even induce a sense of contrition and a readiness for repentance. I am neither a musician nor an expert on music. But the shattering experience of music has been a challenge to my thinking on ultimate issues. I spend my life working with thoughts. And one problem that gives me no rest is: do these thoughts ever rise to the heights reached by authentic music?\u201D Because we\u2019re leaving the rational mind behind. We\u2019re surpassing it. And we have it. What we need is a balance. We need to be whole and relate intuition to rationality. But I believe so strongly that intuition has to come first, and the rational is the ordering of the intuitive thing. Because if the rational comes first, it\u2019s incomplete and leads in the wrong direction. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with the composer, conductor, and writer Alice Parker. You were born in 1925. Yes. One thing that occurs to me as I think about the sweep of your life and work is that churches and religious traditions have been such a primary inspiration center for great music. Obviously not the only center, but the choral music \u2014 I mean, in the United States, what do we think of? We think of churches. And that institution itself is evolving, the way people, like I was and probably like you were \u2014 born into a congregation, born into a set of hymns. Right, right. And I just \u2014 I\u2019m curious about how you think about that evolution and with your love of this piece of our life together. Where do your thoughts go with that? As a composer, I only write on commission for performance. I don\u2019t write anything that I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be performed or when. And the church, as it always has been, is full of opportunity. There\u2019s just such room there. The story really is about the human story, and the human story in relationship to that which we cannot understand. And so there\u2019s just such room there for play. And then the words about it, the poems. Dickinson is full of Christian allusion, and she never mentions Jesus, and she rarely mentions God. But it is that \u2014 exactly that same, trying what so many of us are trying to do now. What is our relationship to the natural world? And how has it become so misguided? And how have we become so blind to what\u2019s obvious around us? I love the Native American saying, \u201CWe teach our children to see when there is nothing to see, and to listen when there is nothing to hear. Because if you\u2019re in the woods at night and you listen for the quiet, you discover it\u2019s not quiet at all.\u201D There are all kind of things going on, and we don\u2019t listen for the quiet. And that\u2019s a huge focus that we need. And I think what\u2019s also there in your thinking is that \u2014 and I so agree with you \u2014 there\u2019s this great searching right now, and it\u2019s about \u2014 what is our relationship to the natural world? It\u2019s also about the connection between that and our physical selves and whatever our spiritual selves are, whatever that is. We persist. Why does every generation keep wondering about God? If you don\u2019t believe, you don\u2019t believe in the same God I believe in. You know? It\u2019s that we\u2019ve realized we are not perfect. We are not complete. We don\u2019t have control over our own destiny. I love the image of the goldfish in the bowl. And we\u2019re like goldfish in the bowl, and somebody else from outside looking at us sees very clearly what our limitations are. We don\u2019t see that at all. And we try to reorder what is around us instead of trying to understand, as other cultures have done much better, what our place is in it and what to honor. But people are always honoring something, and we honor what we cannot understand. And we\u2019re, in our culture, very loath to admit that we can\u2019t control it. So the more that we can feel at home in a universe of what we are, an infinitesimal speck in the great sweep of time, if there is such a thing as time and space \u2014 this ever-expanding universe \u2014 I can\u2019t get my head around that. I have a feeling it\u2019s a game of mirrors, and you\u2019re expanding except there\u2019s a mirror. So it looks as if you\u2019re going in a million directions, but actually it\u2019s very controlled. This \u2014 who am I? So a lifelong job is to discover who I am, and therefore who you are, and who anybody else is. And the big challenge for us now is to be secure and accepting of who we are so that we can look at someone else and be secure and accepting of them. And it seems as if we go from generation to generation, certainly amassing knowledge of all kinds of things, but we haven\u2019t advanced one iota in understanding each other, ourselves or each other. And so this is the huge challenge, and that anything like group singing that can overcome those differences, the ego taking shape over anything else, anything that we can do is going to lead to a better world. And there\u2019s no way \u2014 you can\u2019t do it from a big platform. You can\u2019t do it from the TV camera because it has to be face-to-face, and it has to be local. Well, that \u2014 as I was thinking about you and realizing, again, this idea that singing is the most companionable of arts, and that there\u2019s this \u2014 there\u2019s a public life aspect of singing and song and sound, even \u2014 the way you \u2014 so, I mean \u2014 I\u2019ll read something. And what it makes me realize \u2014 because I said I see singing coming back. I see people finding ways to reinvent group singing, even if there\u2019s not a tradition intact. I also experience a great longing for cross-generational relationship, which went away with the way we restructure. Yes. Right. And of course, how has all this music of the ages been passed down but through generations, people hearing their parents and grandparents sing? Anyway, here\u2019s something you wrote I found so beautiful that just speaks to this communal aspect of this. \u201CAs the first often faint sounds come from my throat, I\u2019m beginning to spin a web connecting me to the group, and my whole effort is to get connecting threads coming back from them. As the song builds, the thread becomes a line, a rope, a cable, a bridge. And finally, there is no division. We are all one in song.\u201D I feel that every time I start to lead any group. There\u2019s always an initial resistance, or almost always an initial resistance of the group. \u201CI don\u2019t dare make a sound,\u201D kind of thing. And then it grows. And my job is to submerge myself in this. I\u2019m not trying to control the song; I\u2019m trying to bring the song out of them. It\u2019s astonishing what\u2019s happened. I just remember, in our little church, my mother reporting to me once after a Christmas carol sing that I\u2019d done. That she saw two local farmers who were very strong-minded individuals, and had had some kind of a quarrel for a generation or so, never speaking to each other, just turning around after they\u2019d just sung a carol together, and smiling at each other. It just \u2014 it breaks down those walls. Yeah. Well, I also \u2014 I mean, there are stories all over the world, also. I remember in Bosnia, after the war there, there were choirs forming, or peoples whose groups \u2014 whose families were literally killing each other, but singing was a way to transcend that, both emotionally and physically. Absolutely. Absolutely. One thing I also really love \u2014 I have watched you kind of on YouTube. With people in this universe of singing who work with what you\u2019ve done. And this sense of joy \u2014 and you speaking often about \u2014 I think you said in one group, \u201COur work is our play.\u201D [laughs] Yes. It is. What a gift to have work like that. It is. The comment I get more than anything else after a sing, when I\u2019ve just gone and with no anthems or anything else like that \u2014 it\u2019s not a rehearsal, and we just sing songs \u2014 \u201CThat was so much fun.\u201D As if all the other music-making they\u2019ve done wasn\u2019t fun. And my interior assessment of what goes on is that I\u2019ve released them into the intuitive. And their rational minds, which are the critical minds, that say, \u201COh, well, we haven\u2019t done this.\u201D Or, \u201CThis isn\u2019t really in tune.\u201D Or, \u201CThis is serious. It\u2019s music.\u201D Yes. Or, \u201CThis it\u2019s serious.\u201D Yeah. It\u2019s the game. It\u2019s the game of tones, and it is so much fun to play that game. If I ask you how this life in music and in sound, composing, conducting, arranging, how this has evolved your sense of what it means to be human, how would you start to answer that question? That there is no such thing as song without human beings to sing it. There might be, but there\u2019s no way that I can possibly ever know that. And if my calling, my work is to get people singing, then my job is to release them into the knowledge that there is this whole means of communication which does not depend on rational thinking, which does depend on using our voices differently to create tones and rhythms. But as you\u2019ve kept coming back to, it\u2019s the only one of the arts that is immediately available to human beings. You don\u2019t have to have paints. You don\u2019t have to have a brush. You don\u2019t have to have a pencil. You don\u2019t have to have anything else. You don\u2019t have to have lessons. Yeah, you don\u2019t have to have lessons. So that it\u2019s just there. And in a way, because it is so available, we don\u2019t value it. \u201CWell, anybody can do that. I want to do something that nobody else can do.\u201D But when you honor it, I think it is given us to overcome these these differences that we have between these walls that we build up of between one person and another, or one culture and another. It\u2019s not that we can all sing the same songs because our languages are very different and our experience is different. But a lullaby is a lullaby all over the world, and a love song is a love song. Boy, can you hear it in the language that you don\u2019t speak at all, but it\u2019s right there. And the song in coping with death and loss is right there. And they are so deeply, fundamentally human. It\u2019s almost as if the song \u2014 well, the song is the language of humans. I go so far as to say, for me, there is absolute daily proof that there is a God because there is music. It\u2019s all right there, inherent in us. So in some ways \u2014 oh, here\u2019s another one that I come back to: that I feel the most complete when I\u2019m singing. And it has nothing to do with the sound of what\u2019s coming out of my mouth. But I am using every bit of any ability that resides anywhere in me, the limits of my imagination. It\u2019s founded on my breath, and breath is spirit in the writings. It\u2019s founded on my breath, and my lungs keep it going. And I certainly want to use my rational mind in what I\u2019m doing to make choices and to criticize and to mold it. But the language is right there. And I\u2019m using spiritual, physical, mental, sensual, whatever the other senses are that we have no idea of and don\u2019t acknowledge. They\u2019re all I\u2019m using, every one of them. When I\u2019m spinning out a melody just all by myself, it doesn\u2019t take anybody else, and particularly when I can enlarge that into other people joining me in that melody, that it\u2019s the most \u2014 it sounds ridiculous, but I really believe it\u2019s the most complete human experience that there is. Everything else is partial. Alice Parker is Artistic Director of the non-profit Melodious Accord and is the author of Melodious Accord: Good Singing in Church.
