  "fullText": "When people come to my restaurant, what I try and do besides growing the best carrots and besides cooking them with the best technique is provide a story. Because when you provide a story, you generally connect people to food in a way that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t taste certain ingredients. And I think it supersedes what I can do as a chef even on my best nights. I think I\u2019m a very good chef. It\u2019s not false modesty. I think I\u2019m a fine chef, but I also think there\u2019s this human experience surrounding it as a connection to it that makes it more delicious. Dan Barber is a celebrated chef \u2014 but his passionate ethics and intellect have made him much more than that. He\u2019s out to restore food to its rightful place vis-\u00E0-vis our bodies, our ecologies, and our economies. And he would do this by resurrecting our natural insistence on flavor. Dan Barber brings his theories to life at two restaurants rooted in a working farm and educational center in the verdant Pocantico Hills of New York, the Stone Barns Center. Food & Wine has called the Blue Hill restaurant at Stone Barns one of the world\u2019s \u201Ctop 10 life-changing restaurants.\u201D Pleasure is Dan Barber\u2019s way in to what he calls the most exciting social movement of our time. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Dan Barber has just published a terrific book, his first, called The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food. I interviewed him as part of a 2010 civic festival in Indianapolis on the arts, humanities, and religion. The \u201CSpirit & Place Festival,\u201D as it\u2019s named, took food as its topic that year. Our conversation was one of the opening events, hosted at a synagogue, Congregation Beth-El Zedeck. Dan Barber\u2019s own Jewish identity rarely finds mention in his prolific writing from Gourmetto The New York Times. But others often turn to transcendent language to describe the experience of his cooking. A great Spanish chef, Ferran Adri\u00E0, for example, wrote this for Time magazine of Dan Barber: \u201CWhen he offers you an appetizer composed of simple vegetables dewy with liquid salt, he is saying something to you. He converses with one of the things that I love in gastronomy: the essence of the produce. These are culinary preparations that retain the soul of the food.\u201D You know, Dan, we came up with this title for tonight at some point, \u201CMindful Eating.\u201D But really what we want to talk about here is this conjunction of spirit, place, and food. And so I\u2019d like to start by hearing a little bit about the beginnings of your life because I have understood that there was a connection between spirit and place and food. I was bar mitzvahed? Yes. I had a beautiful luncheon after the bar mitzvah? Yes. Well, I grew up in New York City, but I spent a lot of time on my grandmother\u2019s farm in the Berkshires. She wasn\u2019t a farmer and she wasn\u2019t a cook, but she was a great eater. She was also a socialite \u2014 social light, not social heavy. I don\u2019t know. She was the chairman of the Berkshire Theatre Festival. The theory I have is that she just loved inviting people to this home at Blue Hill Farm on Blue Hill Road in Great Barrington. And she wanted cows grazing, and she wanted things growing. And as people, you know, munched on cocktails and whatever, she talked about preserving this open space. I think she felt very deeply about it and, you know, if there\u2019s anything that I was marinating in at the time, it was this sort of responsibility by way of pleasure. So were you growing up in New York City when you weren\u2019t spending the summers on the farm? Yeah, right, right. So were you getting different messages about food that you then had to bring together and balance and play off of that as you moved towards your path as a chef? That\u2019s a really great question. I\u2019ve never been asked that. So I guess the thing that comes to mind is that, well, my mother passed away when I was very young and my father tried to cook and was not great. He was a really bad cook. One anecdote that comes to mind is he used to cook scrambled eggs, enough that my memory of my childhood is often having these like hard, sort of burnt, like really overcooked eggs. What\u2019s interesting is that I didn\u2019t know they were hard, burnt, overcooked eggs until I was sick with tonsillitis when I think I was 15. And my aunt, who was an expert cook, lovingly prepared food for me. And she prepared scrambled eggs whipped over a double boiler with this French butter that she had gotten at this market. This stuff just slid down my throat. [laughter] I was like, \u201CGod,\u201D this \u2014 first of all, \u201Cthis is food. This is real. This is real scrambled eggs. This is food. This is love.\u201D Now you would say, okay, so I dismissed my father. But actually, I think it took my father\u2019s eggs to make me appreciate my aunt\u2019s eggs. [laughter] Yeah. The idea that I grew up \u2014 I mean, I grew up in the 1960s when my parents had just discovered, as all their friends had discovered, that food could come from boxes and cans and this was progress. But if we had an idea about cooking and about chefs, it was about working magic with ingredients. It was about a metamorphosis, right? Where you took just enough of this and just enough of that and you came up with this dish that transformed all the ingredients into something completely other. And when I read about how you cook and approach food, it\u2019s very different. It\u2019s a completely different philosophy and approach. Well, those were the Dark Ages of cooking, I think. This goes to the heart of this question that I deal with sort of every day. One of my restaurants is on a farm, so when there\u2019s a carrot in front of me and I followed the seed all the way through the composting and the weeding and the brilliance of the growth, you know, it really comes down to like you\u2019re face to face with the farmers that raised a lamb that you\u2019re roasting or you\u2019re face to face with that farmer that raised the carrot. It\u2019s kind of crazy to think that I would be doing something that would be more interesting or more even artistic or more brilliant than something that they have done throughout this process. So, in that sense, very humbling and, I think, a look at the future of better food. And I think what you unfortunately grew up infused with was this time we\u2019re hopefully just coming out of, this disconnection with where your ingredients are coming from and how they were produced. So there\u2019s something so liberating and wonderful about how you talk about sustainability and becoming more ethical with our food and this also comes through in Michael Pollan\u2019s writing and in Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s writing. Two writers I\u2019m very influenced by, yeah. Right. And this wonderful \u2014 I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s surprising, but surprisingly, between doing the right thing and doing the ethical thing, is also the pleasurable thing. And that sustainability is also about resurrecting flavor. Yeah. And the most pleasurable thing and the most delicious, so that they\u2019re all run along parallel lines. I mean, that\u2019s the serendipity of what I do, which is that, you know, my shiv is like I want to cook good food and it\u2019s in the pursuit of great flavor. It just so happens that you\u2019re attached to great ecology by definition. I mean, this is one of those things that\u2019s so axiomatic we forget. I think it\u2019s part because of what you mentioned. We went through this period, especially in the United States, where we\u2019re so removed from how food was grown and where it\u2019s coming from and who was growing it that we forget just the most obvious thing is that a delicious carrot, a delicious slice of lamb, has attached to it these decisions in the pasture and the field that are both thoughtful and intensely ethical as well as ecological, that you can\u2019t have an unethically raised lamb, an unthoughtfully raised carrot, and have a delicious lamb and carrot dish. It\u2019s impossible. Even the greatest chefs couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a public conversation with Dan Barber. He\u2019s a celebrated chef and a leader in the \u201Cfarm to table\u201D movement. So, I just want to bring this close to the ground for just a minute. So, for example, this carrot. Yeah. How would you treat that carrot differently? You\u2019re also saying it\u2019s going to taste different now. Maybe the carrot you\u2019ve grown is going to taste different because you\u2019ve been part of its life from the very beginning. Right. So let\u2019s talk about on the physiological level. The physiological level is, you know, a carrot that\u2019s grown in the right way, whether it\u2019s on our farm or, generally speaking, a local carrot because locality has a lot to do with this in the sense that local carrots are generally sold at a local farmers\u2019 market and a local farmers\u2019 market is generally supported from the growing part of it by small farmers. And smaller farmers tend to raise a diversity of vegetables, a diversity of carrots, different seeds of carrots, a carrot that\u2019s grown in a monoculture. A carrot that\u2019s grown one variety of carrot for 500 acres tend to be cheaper carrots. They tend to be, from the farmer\u2019s standpoint, a bit more efficient in the sense that you can raise this one carrot, have a lot of command and control, you tend to have to do all sorts of amendments that are generally chemically intensive to make a carrot grow in a monoculture over that many acres. So from the physiological definition of two strikingly different carrots and, of course, if you follow the story of those two carrots, one that\u2019s grown in a monoculture and one that\u2019s grown in a locally diverse system with different seeds of carrots, you generally tell a story of how the world is used, two different ways of using the world. But then there\u2019s this other part of why the carrot tastes so good that can tell a story about the carrot. Because what is great taste? When I tasted that egg, you know, part of it was my aunt\u2019s cooking technique, but part of it was the love and the support and the fact that I was feeling ill and this whole understanding of what surrounds eating. I mean, what is a great meal? What\u2019s your best meal? Well, a lot of people say the best meal is when they\u2019re on vacation in Europe or when they were with their grandmother because their grandmother could cook the best, or because the French could cook the greatest, you know, beef they\u2019ve ever had. But actually, both those examples lead to your state of mind. You were happiest when you were with your grandmother and you felt a certain way that you could taste flavors that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t taste. So when people come to my restaurant, what I try and do besides growing the best carrots and besides cooking them with the best technique is provide a story. Because when you provide a story, you generally connect people to food in a way that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t taste certain ingredients. I think it supersedes what I can do as a chef even on my best nights. I think I\u2019m a very good chef. It\u2019s not false modesty. I think I\u2019m a fine chef, but I think my thing has become much more exaggerated because of the use of ingredients which physiologically \u2014 I believe there\u2019s a physiological explanation that makes them better-tasting, but I also think there\u2019s this human experience surrounding it, this connection to it that makes it more delicious. There\u2019s a great line that Michael Pollan has that, \u201CWhen it comes to food, until very recent generations, most of our food choices came out of our culture. And that when it comes to food, culture is just a fancy word for your mother.\u201D Yeah, it\u2019s a great way of saying it. That\u2019s right. But that that\u2019s been lost. That\u2019s right. Well he also \u2014 Michael also often quotes this term called biophilia, which is this sort of natural, innate connection that we need to feel towards nature. And he extends that to a need, hardwired of us, to want to know where our food is coming from. The fact that we\u2019ve become so disassociated with food just begs this larger point that we need to taste these tastes that I\u2019m talking about. We need to know who\u2019s growing our food, where it\u2019s coming from. How it\u2019s grown. Some story \u2014 not a false narrative, a real story about that food. And when you can provide that, I think you end up providing a better eating experience. And I think to the extent that you\u2019ve become an activist, it\u2019s in this way of linking storytelling to sustainability. You\u2019ve become an activist as a storyteller. Okay, so I\u2019ll tell a story that came to mind as I was reading you. My only transcendent food memory of my childhood \u2014 this is sad \u2014 but the only transcendent food memory I have is just in a few summer months, we would go to this ramshackle store that was on Main Street. Which I suppose now we might call a farmers\u2019 market because it was food that came from farms, which was totally disdained most of the time. But the tomatoes there? We remember those tomatoes, right? First of all, they were enormous, and one of those tomatoes on a plate was transcendent. It was a meal. It was beautiful and it even took us beyond this idea that progress is what we ate most of the time. So a lot of us remembering those tomatoes and then being emboldened by people like you have planted our own tomatoes, right? I did it and they don\u2019t taste like that. And I think you also know things that I want you to tell us about. I mean, you\u2019ve also written that everyone growing their own vegetables is also not the answer to relinking these things that may be very natural. Yeah. I\u2019m sorry that tomato did not \u2014 so what happened? Do you feel like you made a mistake? Well, I mean, I think we don\u2019t know. What you\u2019re talking about is all the things that go into a beautiful tomato. It\u2019s not just a matter of me digging a little dirt in my backyard. Right. It\u2019s unfortunate because a lot of the seeds of the tomatoes that were around in the \u201960s and \u201970s have been lost to varieties that even when you buy seeds at a store that\u2019s selling them or through the Internet are seeds that are generally for \u2014 even in a home garden, are generally for greater harvest. So we would be buying the same seeds that would be found on big industrial farms. Yeah. You have to go back a bit further to get low-production tomatoes because the greater production that\u2019s made on the vine, the less flavor because you\u2019re disbursing the flavor, the energy, from the plant into more tomatoes than you otherwise would. So in other words, you know, this is because customers of seeds want a lot of tomatoes in their gardens and what they get is a good yield and what they end up suffering from is a lack of flavor, which is too bad. So when I had Barbara Kingsolver on the show \u2014 I mean, Barbara Kingsolver wrote this book about spending a year where they ate almost only what they could grow. They basically ate what they could grow themselves. And a lot of peoples\u2019 reaction to that was, great, but I live in Brooklyn or I live in Minnesota. And you actually have a farm in a part of the world with four seasons, but I also think it\u2019s kind of a relief that you say that you also like to have citrus fruit on your plate, and that you do avail yourself of the wonderful things that technology makes possible, of modern distribution systems, if you will. I think what\u2019s different is\u2026 I said that to Barbara and she wasn\u2019t like that psyched about it. Really? Yeah, a little bit. So I\u2019m not a purist at all. Like I love citrus. That\u2019s like my weakness. So you can\u2019t grow citrus where\u2026 What I think is different, what you\u2019re doing that\u2019s new is you\u2019re calling it a luxury, right? I mean, you\u2019re reminding us that it\u2019s not natural to be able to have citrus in New York in January. Right. I mean, that is something we forgot; we have forgotten. Right, and if you treat it as a luxury, I think you enjoy it more. And I think you put it in the sphere that it belongs, which is something that\u2019s delicious and a part of the gloriousness of \u2014 the same distribution chain that makes local food so expensive is, on the flip side of it, the distribution chain that gives us pineapples and citrus fruit in the middle of the winter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that. I think it\u2019s one of the blessed things. It\u2019s the question of proportion and to what extent are you taking, you know, that as your diet year-round and what percentage are you not looking at local agriculture to actually feed you in the winter. I\u2019m glad you mentioned that we\u2019re four seasons because one of the things I really take great pride in for the Stone Barns Center farm is that they\u2019re just brilliant at providing delicious calories in the middle of the winter and some of the most delicious food is in the winter. I\u2019m just going to give you a quick example. I think it\u2019s critical. We could be, in these cold climates in which we\u2019re sitting now in the northeast where I am, growing the most unbelievable, for example, root vegetables. And vegetables like kale and spinach and other, Brussels sprouts, that actually thrive in the intensity of the cold. So what the Stone Barns Center is heading more in the direction of \u2014 driven by flavor, by the way. This is not driven by some kind of ethical underpinning and it\u2019s not a moral issue. This is just simply because the best root vegetables have to go through intense freezes to get the sugar. To get the root vegetables that all of us adore, the beets and the parsnips and the celery root, the carrots, for sure, these need to be stressed under several hard freezes. And, in fact, if stayed in the ground in the right soil with the right seeds, end up becoming carrots that far, far exceed in flavor, in sugar and in flavor, anything that\u2019s grown in a monoculture in those warmer climates. There\u2019s the quick example. We\u2019ve proved this finally. We grew a variety of carrots called Mokum carrots in the middle of February. We picked them out of the ground. Jack Algiere is the Stone Barns Center farmer, a four-seasons farmer. He picked them out and we brought them to the kitchen and we took a Brix test. We squeezed a little bit of carrot juice on a refractometer, which measures part per billion of sugar, and it registered this Mokum carrot 13.8 on the refractometer. Now for all of you, you should be gasping . It\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t gasp either. We\u2019re trying to be quiet. I had no idea what that meant. It means, I\u2019ve since learned, that 13.8 percent of this small carrot was pure sugar. When I looked up a Mokum carrot on the Internet to find out what an average Brix number would be, the highest I got was 12, so it was literally off the charts. Now we, just for curiosity sake, took a Brix measuring of a carrot that we used for stocks in the restaurant. It\u2019s an organic carrot, the kind of carrot you\u2019d find in like a Whole Foods, so it\u2019s a high-quality organic carrot. What did it measure on the Brix? 0.0. Oh, my gosh. Right. Undetectable with sugar. So this just absolutely wigged me out. I mean, I knew there\u2019d be a difference because I can taste the difference, but did I know that it was going to be so dramatic? So I finally got to a plant physiologist that I sort of fell in love with. He\u2019s a part-time poet. And what he said to me was very poetic and I think right to the point. He said, \u201CThe carrot is converting its starches to sugars because, in those hard freezes, it doesn\u2019t want ice crystallization. Because if it gets ice crystallization, it dies.\u201D Then what he ended with is that what you\u2019re tasting is sweetness, but what the plant \u2014 what the root vegetable is telling you is that it doesn\u2019t want to die. What we have in these cold climates for certain vegetables \u2014 and I think they can provide us quite deliciously and quite healthfully for the cold season \u2014 is something that California and Texas and Arizona and Oaxaca and Florida and all the rest cannot provide. That\u2019s working within a natural system for the betterment of food. By the way, there\u2019s increasingly a direct connection between Brix levels and nutrient density, which is really interesting when you think about it and it makes sense to us. I mean, you just think about it sort of axiomatically. Of course, the best-flavored food would also be the healthiest and the most nutrient dense. But there\u2019s actually studies now that are showing that the highest concentration of nutrient density can be covered in that higher Brix, which goes back to Michael Pollan\u2019s point is that not long ago we were hunter-gatherers trying to figure out what was good for us and for our children and healthy. And if we\u2019re hard-wired to go for that sugar and that flavor, we\u2019re also going for the best nutrient density and, as it turns out, the best ecological decisions for a farm. Right. I don\u2019t know. I think somewhere in there you said this is not about ethics. But, I mean, were you talking about something that\u2019s life-giving, that\u2019s beautiful, that\u2019s pleasurable, that has ethical value? If I become a rabbi, this will become about ethics. But those things have ethical value in Jewish tradition. Indeed true. Look, I\u2019m of just the mind that I feel very fortunate that I believe in something that, from A to Z, is rooted in hedonism. It\u2019s really a nice thing to be an advocate of, you know? It\u2019s like even religion, especially religion, actually \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t be saying this on the bimah, but especially religion, to get to fulfillment, to get to this exalted state, it\u2019s often requested of you to give up something, to sacrifice. That\u2019s part of most religions. When you are greedy for the best food, you are by definition being greedy for the kind of world, the way the world is used, the kind of world that you want used in the proper way. That\u2019s the true definition of sustainability and why I think this movement that I stated so confidently is the most exciting social movement in America today has such legs. People always ask me, \u201CHaven\u2019t you seen the height of this? Isn\u2019t this a fad?\u201D And they\u2019re so wrong. They\u2019re so wrong because this is only because once people taste the carrot with 13.8 percent Brix, you\u2019re not going to settle for the 0.0. You\u2019re willing to pay for and invest in the kind of agriculture that will give you the flavor and the nutrient values that you want, whether you\u2019re an environmentalist or not. So I\u2019m like a buying opportunity for this movement. Well, yeah, but, you know, there is labor that goes into it. It\u2019s just that you don\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel as ascetic. I mean, it doesn\u2019t feel like a sacrifice. Yeah, which is nice, right? Yeah. I actually brought this \u2014 we did a show with the Dalai Lama and three of his leaders on happiness. I heard \u2014 I haven\u2019t heard it, yeah. But I want to read you this. I was preparing for you and somebody wrote to us, one of our listeners from Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. This was what she said responding to that happiness discussion: \u201CI found happiness in preparing food. No other activity grounds me more fully and alights my senses and keeps me in the now. Mincing and dicing sooth me. Reading cookbooks excites me.\u201D This is my kind of woman. This is your kind of woman, yeah. But you could call it a discipline and it can feel like a spiritual discipline, I think, because precisely as you say, there\u2019s that pleasure, there\u2019s that good at the end of it. Yeah, but\u2026 Maybe we\u2019re stretching this too far. No, no, no, no. I love the quote. But you\u2019re saying that she would feel this whether or not she was supporting all the things that I\u2019m talking about? No, I\u2019m saying that the work \u2014 you said that this is greed, that\u2019s it just about pleasure, but there\u2019s work that goes into creating that pleasure. It\u2019s a labor of love. Right, right, absolutely. I mean, it reminds me of Yom Kippur in that the work you go through during the day of fasting ends up \u2014 whatever you get when you break the fast, it tastes a lot better than it would if you were eating during the three meals a day. So, yes, there\u2019s attached to this is that you have to cook. And for those people who look at cooking as drudgery or look at cooking as hard labor and a total unenjoyment, you know, this is a problem. Because at the root of all of this actually \u2014 and Michael Pollan has said this too, and I really subscribe to it \u2014 it\u2019s all about cooking. It\u2019s like people always say, well, what can you do for this movement if I live in, you know, in an extreme northern climate and I really can\u2019t do anything about it? What can one average person do who has all the constraints of either their ecologic conditions or their work conditions? The answer is, you cook. Because when you cook, you\u2019re opting out of the kind of food chain that\u2019s cooking for you. And when a food chain is cooking for you, it\u2019s usually processed. It\u2019s usually of lesser-grade ingredients, which means that it\u2019s usually degrading the environment, which means because it has less flavor, usually has less flavonoids, which means it has less health benefits. So all those things are attached to when you\u2019re not cooking. When you are cooking, you\u2019re engaging in some type of direct communication with the fresh ingredient that\u2019s not aptly processed. And if you can get that locally, you\u2019ve done tremendous amounts to give your contribution to the betterment of the world, besides a more pleasurable dinner. You can listen again and share this conversation with Dan Barber through our website, onbeing.org. There you can also watch the complete, unedited video of my fun and edifying conversation with him. Coming up, Dan Barber on the perception that his kind of cooking and eating remains an elite experience; also, the exciting link he sees on the horizon between maximum flavor and life-giving nutrition, even for treating cancer. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with Dan Barber \u2014 an award-winning chef, deep thinker, and social visionary. I interviewed him at a live, public event in Indianapolis. He is co-owner and chef of two celebrated New York restaurants that have a working farm and an educational center \u2014 the Stone Barns Center \u2014 at their heart. We\u2019ve been talking about the pleasure-orientation of the movement Dan Barber is part of \u2014 pursuing new ecologies and economies through taking pleasure in landscape and flavor. But, as he just told me, this is not just about how we farm and shop; it\u2019s also about getting back to cooking. Do you have compassion for those of us who want to cook more, but have jobs and children and life feels hard enough as it is and food is one thing that you can buy in packages and bring home? Yeah. You know, you\u2019re not making me compassionate\u2026 Maybe not. You don\u2019t have much compassion. You know why? Because then you\u2019d have to say \u2014 if I said to you that 25 years ago, you know, with all the time spent on TV, we\u2019re going to spend another four hours a day on average on the Internet, and you would say, \u201CWow, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019d fine four hours in the day.\u201D And I\u2019d say, not only people are going to find four hours, but 95 percent penetration of Internet use for 4.5 hours a day or whatever it\u2019s up to today average, you would say that\u2019s absolutely crazy. Nobody will spend that time, nobody has that time in the day. Well, we figured out how to do it. So the question comes down to priorities. To what extent is cooking and eating and all the rest of the things that are attached to that, to what extent does that become a priority? And if it is a priority, you make the time. It goes hand in hand with the amount of money you spend because what we\u2019re talking about \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to skirt around it; I think it\u2019s a big issue. It\u2019s more expensive. There\u2019s no question about it. You\u2019re paying the real cost of growing food. Locally, it\u2019s usually more expensive. So the question is, again back to the Internet example or cell phone use, 25 years ago, if I said there\u2019d be 95 percent penetration in cable television, you all would have said, \u201CThat\u2019s nuts. We have free television. Who is going to be able to find $125 a month extra?\u201D You all would have agreed with Krista, right? I would have said, not only that, you\u2019re going to find another $125 for cell phone use in disposable income. Everyone would say, \u201COh, $250 extra? Nobody has that money.\u201D Well, of course, we found it because we found it indispensable without those things. So can we excite this issue around food and pleasure to the extent that people feel the same way about dinner? Tell me what \u2014 I\u2019m interested in this link between beauty and eating, that it actually has historically been a visual and communal as well as just as something about taste. So when someone is in your restaurant and a plate appears before them, what does it look like? I mean, the whole table. Visually, what\u2026 Okay. Well, so there are two parts to that question. First of all, the whole table and the experience in place. So I\u2019m talking now about Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Just outside of New York City; it\u2019s at an old Rockefeller estate. So surrounding the restaurant is 80 acres of pastoral, agriculture, iconic New England landscape that\u2019s 25 miles from Manhattan. So very relaxing, very beautiful. Rockefeller inspired and donated land that\u2019s just absolutely unheard of anywhere in the world really. So there\u2019s that beauty and then you come closer into the beauty. My brother is my business partner in the restaurant and my sister-in-law is the designer, and so she designs everything that you touch and feel and look at. She\u2019s extraordinarily talented. You sit down and I think at the table you become a part of this farm experience through elegance. There\u2019s white tablecloths and there\u2019s nice silverware, but she has a mindset and an approach to this that\u2019s quite lovely. Okay, so I\u2019ve set the scene. So now the food comes. And so, you know, what we charge \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t want to shy away from this. It\u2019s a really expensive restaurant, for sure. You\u2019re paying a lot of money for all of this bounty and style and beauty. My plates, compared to what other chefs \u2014 not compared to, say, the chicken pot pie that your children are eating tonight \u2014 I\u2019m not demeaning the chicken pot pie. I\u2019m saying my food would look more like your chicken pot pie than it would look like the high-end haute cuisine that\u2019s being played, so the food is, like, not ornate and, you know, it\u2019s not beautiful. What\u2019s beauty? But a lot of people have a definition of beauty as being very constructed plates of food. So my plates of food generally are not deconstructed, but unconstructed, and they tend to look like I would imagine one of the farmers is standing over me \u2014 and often he is, one of the two \u2014 and kind of laughing when a gratuitous garnish is placed or a stacking of something is placed that takes away from the work that they\u2019ve done. Because that\u2019s what it does. It takes time to do it; it takes your focus. The vectors come point at me, the chef, the stylist and the creator, instead of the agriculture that produced it. But then the question\u2019s like, what is beautiful for this? I would like to think the beauty in it is that it connects right to the farmer. I don\u2019t want to say that to everyone. It\u2019s hard. I would go over to the diner and say that. What do you do about it? Sandy Sasso told me that the food she got was beautiful, and some food writer called coming to your restaurant like a spiritual journey. So I think it\u2019s beautiful, and I know my chicken pot pie was beautiful. But I think what you say also is that this is also an essential part of eating. It\u2019s the ingredients, it\u2019s the presentation, it\u2019s seeing this as something beautiful and blessed and to be honored, the whole experience. Right, but I have the luxury of working with my sister-in-law and I mentioned my brother is a brilliant businessman and can help put all this together. Then, you know, it\u2019s much easier to talk about these things on a canvas where there\u2019s agriculture surrounding everywhere you look. So when you\u2019re in the middle of midtown Manhattan \u2014 and I know this because I have another restaurant in the middle of midtown Manhattan with my brother and sister-in-law \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to talk about these issues because it\u2019s the way you feel when you sit down in the middle of the West Village and the tables are quite cramped and the energy is quite kinetic. So you end up having a different experience. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s just two very different experiences, but I think the agricultural connection, the beauty that you\u2019re talking about, is a lot easier to get across when you\u2019re in the middle of a farm. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with chef-thinker Dan Barber at a civic event held at Congregation Beth-El Zedeck in Indianapolis. The audience was also invited to submit questions. Okay, Rabbi Dennis Sasso is going to moderate questions. Rabbi, come to the bimah. I\u2019ve always wanted to say that. This question came up from several members of the audience, and I\u2019ll ask it from two different people because they\u2019re complementary. \u201CIs the idea of food that is carefully grown and prepared only for the well-off? How do we nourish this way of thinking for a wider part of the population?\u201D And another question along the same lines: \u201CHow do you expand local healthy food systems to feed low-income, inner-city people?\u201D So the first question is, is this a movement for the elites? And the answer is \u2014 I sound often defensive when I answer this because I feel defensive \u2014 it has been a movement that\u2019s pretty much started with the people who can afford to pay for this kind of food. Do I think that\u2019s unfortunate? I really don\u2019t because, again, you mention Michael Pollan who\u2019s on my mind now, but he often says that a lot of great movements in this country, including women\u2019s suffrage, including the civil rights movement, started with elites and ended up becoming mass movements through powerful ideas. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It takes a long time, especially in America, generally a generation. But those ideas can be quite powerful if they come in that sense from the top. The sort of second and even connected to the first part of the question, moving forward, I expressed to you how powerful I feel like these ideas are for the future and that this is really we\u2019re at the start of something, not at the high point; we\u2019re at the start of something. And that this is going to become a much more American universal experience of wanting this kind of food. I think that way, in part, because I think the real cost of producing this cheap food is going to catch up to the agribusiness and conglomerates that are supporting our conventional, for the food that we eat, mostly the 80 to 90 percent I\u2019m talking about. The cost of bringing that to market is going to be too expensive in our generation and certainly by the time our children are our age. And by that, I mean that to produce the food that we\u2019re eating today, it\u2019s just too environmentally expensive. Here are two questions that I\u2019m going to tie together: \u201CWhy aren\u2019t you a vegetarian?\u201D \u201CHave you made any connections between ethical food preparation and kosher food preparation?\u201D Yeah, okay. This is a great question. I feel like I\u2019m in the fifth set with Nadal here. The first question is about why aren\u2019t I a vegetarian, and why am I not standing up here and saying, you know, eat less meat? The answer is because I come from the lower Hudson Valley, New England, and my ecological conditions are dictating that we eat a lot of meat because we\u2019re grassland. What we grow best, besides those carrots, is an amazing diversity of healthful grass for animals \u2014 the grasslands, by the way, that built New England, that built the dairy industry. There\u2019s no surprise that this is iconic landscape that I reference with my grandmother. That wasn\u2019t just about building beauty; that was about building what they were taking advantage of, which was cows grazing on great grass to produce great milk. That same ecology holds true today. Those iconic open pasture lands I talked about produce the best-tasting meat in the world. So for me to be a vegetarian and be a strict advocate of it wouldn\u2019t be listening to the ecology that the land is telling us it wants to grow. So one of the requirements of a chef, I think, for the future is not to propose a cuisine on the landscape. It\u2019s going to have to be listening to the landscape to determine what kind of chef and what kind of eater we want to be. And if you\u2019re in southern Los Angeles and San Diego and you want to be a vegetarian, God bless you. You should be, you should be. But if you want to be in New England and you want to improve the ecological conditions of where you are, you\u2019re eating meat. There\u2019s no question about it. There is no healthy ecological system that I\u2019ve ever seen that doesn\u2019t include animals. It just doesn\u2019t because the manure from the animals is a free ecological resource that amends the soil, that gives you better-tasting and healthful vegetables. That\u2019s been around since the beginning of time. So to say that vegetarians live on this higher plane of ethics \u2014 and I\u2019m not here to argue that slaughtering animals doesn\u2019t carry with it some weight, but you have blood on your hands when you eat vegetarian as well, especially if you\u2019re in the northeast. Because food\u2019s coming from somewhere, and your cows are coming from somewhere in the winter. And if they\u2019re traveling hundreds of miles, in many cases, thousands of miles, you are burning fossil fuels to get them there. And generally they\u2019re produced in monocultures, and that has a huge cost on natural living systems. They might be animals that you and I can identify with, but they\u2019re insects and bugs and whole types of flora and fauna that are dying to produce those vegetables. That\u2019s not an ethical way to eat, I don\u2019t think, in the future. The kosher laws, though, is a very interesting question because I\u2019ve become fascinated by it. I have a relationship with a grain farmer in the northeast who grows organically in a very diversified grain system named Klaus Martens. He\u2019s probably one of the more brilliant farmers I\u2019ve ever met. What he told me is that, when he grows \u2014 a big part of his business is growing spelt for matzos for Passover. And he\u2019s strict I think it\u2019s glatt kosher \u2014 it\u2019s kosher, anyway. So he needs a rabbi at the farm when he\u2019s harvesting. The rabbi grabs hold of the combine and walks with him on the field. These grain farms are enormous, even in upstate New York. It\u2019s a lot like what you have here, thousands of acres. And a combine with a rabbi walking next to it has to go a lot slower than it would without, which generally makes kosher food, by the way, more expensive. That\u2019s one of the issues related to kosher food. But what he realized, when the rabbi would stop the combine, he would stop it because there was wild garlic in the field. Wild garlic in the field would make the matzo treyf for Passover. You have to go and pick out the wild garlic. So he started researching both kosher law \u2014 what was it? Why is wild garlic in the field, it\u2019s natural? Why is that considered treyf ? What he discovered was that, from a biological point of view, wild garlic was an example of low sulfur content in his soil. He had an imbalance in his soil and, when he corrected the balance \u2014 by the way, by manure, by taking extra runs of his cattle through the spelt field \u2014 he corrected the imbalance and got rid of the wild garlic. And he made more money because he could go faster on the combine with the rabbi, and the quality of his grain was improved dramatically. Now he\u2019s given me many examples \u2014 I think that\u2019s a really good one \u2014 of kosher laws that seemingly have no reason to them. But, of course, if you research them and think about it, they have to be grounded in agriculture, in the proper agriculture that produces the best food and the best nutrition. This is chef and social visionary Dan Barber. I\u2019m Krista Tippett; Rabbi Dennis Sasso is moderating questions from the audience. \u201CTell us how we can prepare ourselves to come to the table and enjoy the experience optimally.\u201D And a related question: \u201CDoes food taste better when made with love? My hypothesis is that, yes, it does taste better. Have you ever come across any evidence that would be able to support this theory?\u201D Well, again, I go back to some of the same things as just like producing food that\u2019s delicious. That ends up getting you to the table, whether you\u2019re in the right frame of mind or not, because you\u2019re after the good food. Then I guess the second part of it is \u2014 what was the second part? I\u2019m sorry. Food with love, food with love. I\u2019m a very like angry cook in my kitchen, so I\u2019m not the right guy\u2026 Are you? Yeah. I yell a lot. It took us all this time to get to that. Yeah, well, it\u2019s only \u2019cause we have a minute left to get to the truth. Yeah. I mean, I yell a lot and I\u2019m very disciplining with the cooks and a little bit abusive. I mean, I\u2019m nothing like what I trained under, nothing. It\u2019s never physical, but the mental is like sometimes really pointed. So why am I doing another confessional? Because I don\u2019t know that there really is this connection between love and happiness and smiling and cooking, and does that actually make the food taste better? I hope not because I\u2019m really in trouble. We could call it passion instead of anger. Okay. So we\u2019ve really, I think, mined your wisdom tonight. Is there something that you\u2019re newly passionate about? Is there some emerging chapter of this story that Michael Pollan hasn\u2019t yet written a book about? Yes! Tell us. There\u2019s two things really quick. The first is that I think one of the things that\u2019s been overlooked in this issue that we\u2019ve talking about is breeders. I\u2019m not talking about bioengineering, genetically modifying seeds. I\u2019m talking about old-school breeders. At Cornell, they\u2019re like the hippies that came in the \u201970s that are there and have seeds literally in their desk drawers that we\u2019ve been growing now; unnamed varieties of tomatoes, unnamed varieties of onions, unnamed varieties of squash have been sitting for years in the desks of these breeders. So these breeders \u2014 and they are largely retiring, at least at Cornell \u2014 are the ones who have literally a vault \u2014 literally a vault \u2014 of information that I think is going to be so important as we transition away from the conventional mindset of agriculture and into this more regional look at agriculture, which is going to rely on these seeds that can withstand the challenges of growing locally and in a diverse system. So I\u2019m really excited about that and I\u2019m working with Jack Algiere and with a lot of these breeders in trying to get them to stay on and work more with us. What they say to me over and over again is, \u201CNo one\u2019s ever asked me about flavor.\u201D I hear it every time from the breeders. It was like clockwork, it\u2019s so weird. No one asks me about flavor. They always ask me about yield and about disease resistance. They\u2019re just like all we have to do is select for flavor. And then the second, it\u2019s just the most exciting introduction I had to Dr. William Li, who\u2019s the head of the Angiogenesis Foundation in Boston at Cambridge, and he\u2019s working on researching capillary growths that feed tumors; not the tumor themselves, but the blood supply that feeds the tumors. So why is that of interest to me? It\u2019s of interest to me because Dr. Li\u2019s approach is to target foods that are high in anti-angiogenic properties that literally shrink tumors. When I saw and heard Dr. Li speak, I felt so moved about what he was talking about. It made so much sense. Food and cancer and food and this idea that, if we eat right, we can actually eat well and starve cancer. What I did when I met him \u2014 I had thought for sure he had thought of this, but I said, all these foods he\u2019s identified as being high in anti-angiogenic properties, like parsnips and grapes and certain teas, I said, \u201CHave you ever studied how those parsnips and grapes are grown?\u201D In other words, is a parsnip just a parsnip or a parsnip grown in the right kind of soil with the right kind of amendments? He looked at me and said, \u201CWe\u2019ve never done those studies.\u201D So what we\u2019re embarking on very slowly is taking ingredients from Stone Barns and sending them to him and getting a read with those Brix levels. Because, again, my own personal wacky theory is that this high Brix level is going to correspond to high nutrient density, which is going to correspond to the kinds of foods that will shrink capillary growth to tumors. He believes it and he\u2019s a foodie, and so we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun, I think, trying to identify these foods that are grown in the right way and giving you 13.8 percent Brix level. Does that correspond with cancer-fighting properties? His theory and mine, for what it\u2019s worth to you, is that there\u2019s a large correlation. So I\u2019m really excited to pursue that. I think we\u2019ll see more of that as we move on with this movement. It\u2019s a great place to end that correlation again that\u2019s run all the way through this between what is life-giving and pleasurable and sustainable. And I really want to thank you for making that equation come to life in your work and for us tonight. Thank you, Krista. Dan Barber is co-owner and executive chef of two restaurants \u2014 Blue Hill New York and Blue Hill at Stone Barns. His new book is well worth a read. It\u2019s called The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food. There was a lot in my live, unedited encounter on stage with Dan Barber that I wish we could have fit into this broadcast. Like his life-changing encounter with an apricot when he was an apprentice chef in France and his fresh and informed perspective on why farmers\u2019 markets and home gardens are only a small slice of the new regional food economies we need. You can watch the video of that full conversation and take a visual taste of a nine-course Dan Barber meal through the eyes of a photographer at onbeing.org.
