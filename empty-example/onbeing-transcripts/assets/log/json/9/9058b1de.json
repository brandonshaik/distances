  "fullText": "It took me a while to put a name to the rare quality that is palpable in Jean Vanier\u2019s life and presence. It\u2019s a wisdom of tenderness. He\u2019s a philosopher and a Catholic social innovator and simply one of the great elders in our world today. The L\u2019Arche movement, which he founded, centered around people with mental disabilities, is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this month. And, Jean Vanier has just won the Templeton Prize. He has devoted his life to the practical application of Christianity\u2019s most paradoxical teachings; that there\u2019s power in humility, strength in weakness, and light in the darkness of human existence. The 147 L\u2019Arche communities in 35 countries have become places of pilgrimage, transformative for those involved and for the world around them. It\u2019s the realization of how to create a culture which is no longer a culture just of competition, but a culture of welcoming, where tenderness, where touch is important, and it\u2019s not \u2014 neither sexualized nor aggressive. It has become human. And I think that this is what people with disabilities are teaching us. It\u2019s, it\u2019s something about what it means to be human and to relate and to celebrate life together. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Jean Vanier grew up during World War II, the son of a prominent French Canadian statesman. He still lives in the original L\u2019Arche community in Trosly-Breuil, France. I sat with him in Maryland in 2007, while he was leading a retreat for college students. The story of L\u2019Arche, which is French for \u201Cthe ark,\u201D began in 1964. Jean Vanier was a professor of philosophy at St. Michael\u2019s College in Toronto. He had done his doctoral work on happiness in the ethics of Aristotle. At Christmas time that year, he went to visit a friend in France who was working as a chaplain for men with mental handicaps. He was especially moved by a vast asylum south of Paris in which all day, 80 adult men did nothing but walk around in circles and take a two-hour compulsory nap. He bought a small house nearby and invited two men from that asylum to share life with him. This was not a linear career move. Jean Vanier had entered the British Royal Naval College as a teenager and commanded an aircraft carrier in his 20s. When he left the military, before he studied philosophy, he spent a year in a contemplative community in a poor area near Paris. L\u2019Eau Vive, as it was called, \u201Cwater of life,\u201D was dedicated to serving the poor, praying, and studying metaphysics. That community near Paris had been founded by a French Dominican priest, and he was very, very deeply a man of God. I think I had a very open intelligence, you know? Since the age of 13, I had been in the world of the navy, I hadn\u2019t done philosophy, I hadn\u2019t done any particular reading. I mean, I was geared for the military. But here was somebody who opened up new visions, new vistas. I remember once following his courses \u2014 and he was so up in it \u2014 and he was saying, he was talking about something . And he said, \u201CYou know, take a very concrete example, the angels, for example.\u201D And everybody laughed and he couldn\u2019t understand, you know, why people are laughing, because it was, to him, a very concrete example. So he was a metaphysician. He was a thinker. He was really a man of God. And he was the one who encouraged me to do studies and encouraged me particularly to work on Aristotle. And the big thing with Aristotle is the primacy of experience over idea. A lot of people don\u2019t know that. The worst thing that can happen is for Aristotelians to become Aristotelians, because then they start reading Aristotle, but they\u2019re no longer in linked with reality \u2014 to touch reality, to listen to people, to see the world evolving and so on. Right. I thought it\u2019s so interesting you said that Aristotle talked about an ethics of desire that is resonant with who we are today because people want to have meaning in their lives, which Aristotle identified, and they want to be thrilled by it. And you said, \u201CAn ethics of desire is good news for us at a time when we have become allergic to an ethics of law.\u201D Yeah. Yes, you see, the heart of everything with Aristotle, desire and pleasure. And for Aristotle, pleasure is not, you know, something which is just sort of fooling around. Pleasure is when you have an activity, which you have performed well, be it philosophizing or struggling for justice. Whatever you do and you do well, it\u2019s filled with pleasure. It\u2019s joyful, the fulfillment of a desire in an activity you\u2019re doing well. And what I think is so edifying about talking about that is, I think, often people might say, look at the life you\u2019ve led and the work that you do and contrast that with what they might call our pleasure-seeking, entertainment-oriented society. But what I hear when you talk about Aristotle, is that you\u2019re not condemning that basic impulse that we have to seek pleasure, to, you know, you\u2019re just saying that we can take that to a much deeper and more profound level. Yeah, it\u2019s just finding, where, what activity will give you the greatest, the deepest pleasure. I mean, for some people it might be drinking whiskey, rock, and so on. But for me it was to find a meaning through philosophy, through my relationship with Jesus, through justice, through, through a struggle. And it\u2019s true that I sense deeply that I\u2019ve always been really a happy person. That doesn\u2019t mean to say I haven\u2019t had difficulties, that doesn\u2019t mean to say I didn\u2019t go through difficult conflicts or stuff like that, but fundamentally, I\u2019ve had a pleasurable life, a joyful life. Talk to me, though, about, you know, how you connect a word like pleasure and this longing with the place where I really sense you found your calling, you understood what was meaningful for you, when you went back to France and you encountered men in an asylum. And somehow, you were seized by that and that has kind of mapped out the direction of your life. Yes, I come back to the reality of pleasure and to the reality of what is my deepest desire and what is your deepest desire? And what \u2014 and somewhere, the deepest desire for us all is to be appreciated, to be loved, to be seen as somebody of value. But not just seen \u2014 and Aristotle makes a difference between being admired and being loved. When you admire people, you put them on pedestals. When you love people, you want to be together. So really, the first meeting I had with people with disabilities, what touched me was their cry for relationship. Some of them had been in a psychiatric hospital. Others \u2014 all of them had lived pain and the pain of rejection. One of the words of Jesus to the, to Peter \u2014and you find this at the end of the gospel of Saint John \u2014 \u201CDo you love me?\u201D \u201CDo you love me?\u201D So, thus, the cry of God saying, \u201CDo you love me?\u201D and the cry of people who have been wounded, put aside, who have lost trust in themselves, they\u2019ve been considered as mad and all the rest. And their cry is, \u201CDo you love me?\u201D And it\u2019s these two cries that come together. Not just in the context of disabilities, you know, you\u2019ve posed this question, you know, the whole \u2014 you\u2019ve said the whole question is, how do we stand before pain? Yeah. All kinds of pain and weakness are difficult for us as human beings. Why is that so excruciating? Why do we such a bad job with it? I think there are so many elements. First of all, we don\u2019t know what to do with our own pain, so what to do with the pain of others? We don\u2019t know what to do with our own weakness except hide it or pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. So how can we welcome fully the weakness of another if we haven\u2019t welcomed our own weakness? There are very strong words of Martin Luther King. His question was always, how is it that one group \u2014 the white group \u2014 can despise another group, which is the black group? And will it always be like this? Will we always be having an elite condemning or pushing down others that they consider not worthy? And he says something, which is quite, what I find extremely beautiful and strong, is that we will continue to despise people until we have recognized, loved, and accepted what is despicable in ourselves. So that, then we go down, what is it that is despicable in ourselves? And there are some elements despicable in ourselves, which we don\u2019t want to look at, but which are part of our natures, that we are mortal. Right. We are very fragile in front of the future. Accidents and sicknesses is the reality. We are born in extreme weakness and our life will end in extreme weakness. So this, people don\u2019t want to hold on to that. They want to prove something. They want security. They want to have big bank accounts and all that sort of stuff. But then also, hold lots of fears within us. Yes. We are a frightened people. And, of course, the big question is, why are we so frightened of people with disabilities? Like a woman who said to me just recently, asked me where I \u2014 what I was doing. And I said that I had the privilege of living with people with disabilities. And she said, \u201COh, but I could never work with people.\u201D And I said, \u201CWhy not?\u201D And she said, \u201CWell, I am frightened of them.\u201D It touches very \u2014 and I believe we\u2019re in front of a mystery of the human reality and people who are very deeply disfigured in their face, in their body. And so \u2014 and it\u2019s the fault of nobody. It\u2019s a reality that is there. And maybe we can work things out and discover what gene it is and so on. But the history of humanity is a history of people being born extremely fragile because sickness and death is part of our \u2014 of our reality. And as you\u2019ve also pointed out many times, we all have, what did you say \u2014\u00A0you called them our weaknesses, our limitations, our disfigurements. Um, they don\u2019t all show on our bodily surface, right? But somehow that, we recoil when it shows. You see, there\u2019s such a need to be appreciated, such a need to be loved. With that sense somewhere that if they see what is broken in me, they\u2019ll no longer love me. So somewhere there has to be a complete change. That we love people not because they\u2019re beautiful or clever, because they\u2019re a person. You told a story, when I heard you speak at St. John\u2019s University years ago, about very happy members of your community. Do you remember that story? Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I was sitting and there was a man who was a bit glum like a lot of people, a bit glum. And but, and anyway, there was a knock on the door. And before I could say \u201CCome in,\u201D Jean Claude walked in and Jean Claude technically would be Down syndrome. And Jean Claude shook my hand and laughed, and shook the hand of the other fellow and laughed, and went out laughing. And the man that had been in my office looked at me and said, \u2018Isn\u2019t it sad, children like that?\u2019 And I mean, he, what was sad was that he was totally blind. He didn\u2019t see that Jean Claude was happy. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, the \u201CWisdom of Tenderness\u201D with Jean Vanier. He created L\u2019Arche, a model of religious community centered around people with mental and intellectual disabilities. You know you\u2019ve written that, from the point of view of faith, those who are marginalized and considered failures can restore balance to our world. Talk to me about that. The balance of our world frequently is seen as a question of power. That if I have more power and more knowledge, more capacity, then I can do more. But does this tension between the doing and the being \u2014 and when you have power, we can very quickly push people down. I\u2019m the one that knows and you don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m strong and I\u2019m powerful, I have the knowledge. And this is the history of humanity. Yes. And that is all of what I\u2019d call the whole educational system, is that we must educate people to become capable and to take their place in society. That has value, obviously. But it\u2019s not quite the same thing as to educate people to relate, to listen, to help people to become themselves. So the equilibrium that people with disabilities could bring is precisely this equilibrium of the heart. Children. You see, maybe a father is a very strong man and businessman, and when he comes home, if he gets down on his hands and knees and plays with the children, it\u2019s the child that is teaching the father something about tenderness, about love, about the father looking at the needs of the child, the face of the child, the hands of the child, relating to the child. And the children, the incredible thing about children is they\u2019re unified in their body and in \u2014 whereas we, we can be very disunified. We can say one thing and feel another. Right. And so as a child can teach us about unity and about fidelity and about love, so it is people with disabilities. It\u2019s the same sort of beauty and purity in some of these people \u2014 it is extraordinary \u2014 and say, \u2018Our world is not just a world of competition, the weakest and the strongest. Everybody have their place.\u2019 That\u2019s \u2014 seems that you have developed quite an important theology of the body through your work with L\u2019Arche. I mean, I think maybe you\u2019re just, you\u2019re edging towards it there, but it\u2019s bigger than that also. Yes, I, you see, L\u2019Arche is not based first on the word. You\u2019ll find lot of communities which are based on the word, thus to say we speak of an ideal together and we are committed to an ideal or to a vision and so on. But L\u2019Arche is based on body and on suffering bodies. And so they are seen as useless, and so we welcome those who apparently are useless. And it\u2019s a suffering body which brings us together. And it\u2019s attention to the body. You see, when somebody comes to our community and is quite severely handicapped, what is important is to see that the body is well. Bathing, helping people dress, to eat. It\u2019s to communicate to them through the body. And then, as the body can become comfortable, then the spirit can rise up. There\u2019s a recognition. There\u2019s a contact. There\u2019s a relationship. We see this with some of our people, like Fran\u00E7oise. Fran\u00E7oise came to our community in 1978, very severely handicap. She couldn\u2019t speak, she could walk a bit, she couldn\u2019t dress herself, she was incontinent, and she couldn\u2019t eat by herself. And today, she is nearly 30 years older. She has become blind and a beautiful person. There was somebody who came to our community not too long ago who was, saw Fran\u00E7oise and the reaction was, \u201COh, what is the point of keeping Fran\u00E7oise alive?\u201D And the leader of the little house said, \u201CBut madam, I love her.\u201D I mean, it\u2019s as if you come in to a home and grandma is in the home and she has Alzheimer\u2019s and you say, \u201CWhat is \u2014 but she\u2019s my grandmother.\u201D I mean, so it\u2019s based on the body, and then from the body, relationship grows. You know that when I went to spend a few days in a L\u2019Arche community a few years ago, I\u2019ve never been hugged so much in my life. It was very physical, joyfully physical and without, you know, some of the inhibitions, you know? On the one hand, yes, our culture says bodies have to be beautiful and faces have to be beautiful, but we also sexualize everything. Yeah, yeah. So that touch becomes complicated and, and touch was so uncomplicated and it was also so appropriate. And that has been something very important for me, because in the navy and then the time after the navy, I think I was a little bit frightened of relationships, particularly with women. I was a man who knew how to be efficient and quick. And I knew how to teach. I knew how to give commands in the navy. And so \u2014 and then starting to live in L\u2019Arche with Raphael and Philippe, it was precisely the realization that what they were crying out for was touch, but also, maybe that\u2019s what I was crying out for and what we would, what I would call safe touch. That\u2019s to say a touch which gives security and reveals. The way one can put one\u2019s arm around the shoulder of some. It\u2019s not to possess them. It\u2019s not to hold on to them. It\u2019s to reveal. And I say this now, you know, it\u2019s super getting older because now I\u2019m 79. And very quickly, you know, I was responsible for one of the homes after I left the directorship. And now, these people who are still in the home, they\u2019ll be saying to me, \u201CYou\u2019re looking tired.\u201D And now, after 70, they said, \u201CYou don\u2019t have to do the washing up anymore.\u201D So, so the very fact that I\u2019m getting older and weaker have brought them closer to me and come up to me and hug me like somebody like Janine who was a very violent woman who had hemiplegia and epileptic concerns. And gradually, she became very peaceful. But sometimes, I\u2019d go and sit down beside her and she would put her hand on my head and she\u2019d say, \u201CPoor old man.\u201D Right. There was a sort of tenderness. And so, it\u2019s the realization of how to create a culture which is no longer a culture just of competition, but a culture of welcoming, where tenderness, where touch is important, and it\u2019s not \u2014 neither sexualized nor aggressive. It has become human. And I think that this is what people with disabilities are teaching us. It\u2019s, it\u2019s something about what it means to be human and to relate and to celebrate life together. I interviewed Jean Vanier at a retreat center in rural Maryland. At onbeing. org, you can watch the video of our entire 90 minute conversation. And while you\u2019re there, download and subscribe to our podcast. All this and more at onbeing.org. Coming up, how Jean Vanier\u2019s vision has expanded beyond Christianity. Also, his understanding of the anguish and commitment of someone to whom he\u2019s been compared, his late friend Mother Teresa. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. I\u2019m speaking today with one of the wise voices in our world, the French Canadian philosopher and social innovator Jean Vanier. He founded the L\u2019Arche movement which is celebrating its 50th year. This model of community began with one home in France and is now in 35 countries on five continents. Mentally disabled core members share daily life and spiritual community with non-disabled \u201Cassistants\u201D. As described in the writings of Jean Vanier, Henri Nouwen, and others, this experience is transformative for all involved \u2014 and for the world around them. L\u2019Arche communities today draw members and visitors or pilgrims from many traditions. Within Roman Catholicism, Jean Vanier is considered by some to be a living saint. I met him in 2007. You know, this question that Jesus asks, who do you say that I am? I wonder how you answer that question or respond to that question here at 79? My experience today is much more the discovery how vulnerable God is. You see, God is so respectful of our freedom. And if as the Epistle of John says that God is love, anyone who has loved in their life knows they\u2019ve become vulnerable. Where are you and the other person and do you love me back? So if God is love, it means that God is terribly vulnerable. And God doesn\u2019t want to enter into a relationship where he\u2019s obliging or she is obliging us to do something. The beautiful text in the Apocalypse, the Book of Revelations: \u201CI stand at the door and I knock. If somebody hears me and opens the door, then I will enter.\u201D What touches me there is God knocking at the door, not kicking the door down, but waiting. Do you, will you open? Do you hear me? Because we\u2019re in a world where there\u2019s so much going on in our heads and our hearts and anxiety and projects that we don\u2019t hear God knocking at the door of our hearts. So I\u2019d say that what touches me the deepest, maybe because I\u2019m becoming myself more vulnerable, is the discovery of the vulnerability of God, who doesn\u2019t oblige. The other element, which is probably, again, linked to that, is that the only thing that\u2019s, what I see important for myself is just to become a friend of Jesus and nothing else. And the whole I think of the mystery of Christianity is just living with Jesus the way Jesus lived in Nazareth with his, with Mary, his mother, and with Joseph. A relationship. John the Baptist was strong, he was powerful. Right. He was prophetic. Jesus was quiet. And he ate with people who are caught up in prostitution, with tax collectors, with lepers and all that. I mean, there\u2019s something so simple about Jesus that he is disarming. We don\u2019t quite know what to do with it. Because frequently, we would want a powerful Jesus who will put everything straight, who will cure everybody, who will do everything that we tell him to do. And it\u2019s not like that. And, of course, one implication of the vulnerable God, of honor in human freedom, is precisely this dark side that, you know, that we\u2019ve been talking about, that human beings cause each other pain, dominate, and destroy. And so, you know, so then I\u2019m kind of coming back at you with the, that theodicy question, the, the question of still, if God is God, you know, is that enough to honor our freedom? Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. I mean, there are so many things we don\u2019t know. And, I mean, I just have to honor what I don\u2019t know. And I can\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s so many things I cannot explain, because explanation is something about headiness. You won\u2019t have it in the head. But the whole question is not to understand, but it\u2019s to be attracted to the place of pain in order to give support to those who are suffering. So if we spent, maybe I\u2019m making something \u2014 but if we try to know too much, it might cut us away from being present. In the degree according to where I\u2019m at and how I am, it is vital that I be present to situations. It\u2019s a very moving thing with St. Francis of Assisi. St. Francis said he couldn\u2019t stand lepers. And one can understand a disfigured leper with no nose or no ear or parts of gaping, you know? And in the Middle Ages or something like in Europe, 20,000 leprosariums, you know, filled with these people that, you know, smelt bad and he said, \u201CI hated it. I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201D And then he said that one day, the Lord brought me into the lepers. \u201CAnd when I left, there was a new gentleness in my body and in my spirit.\u201D It was, what struck me when he said a new gentleness in my body and in my spirit. And it says, \u201CFrom there, I really left to serve the Lord.\u201D So Francis the conversion, when I say the conversion, I\u2019m talking about a change of the attitude because conversion is a change of attitude. It\u2019s not just a quest of changing religion or that sort of stuff. It\u2019s an inner change. And from the sort of fear and despisal of what appeared the most dirty, which in this period was the smell of the leper and the \u2014 he discovered there was a presence of God in the leper. So we can then begin to understand the whole mystery of rejection of God because we don\u2019t want a god who is hidden in the dirt or hidden in dirty people or in smelly people or disfigured people or in those 40 million people who are in the refugee camps throughout the world. You are deeply Catholic, I believe. And you were raised in the Roman Catholic tradition, or steeped in Catholic theology. And the L\u2019Arche communities are Christian at their core and based on this essence of your understanding of God and Jesus that you\u2019ve been describing. And one interesting thing that\u2019s happened, I think, in the course of this great experiment of L\u2019Arche is that, you know, the communities in India also have Hindu participants. And I was reading something you wrote recently that your community in France now has some Muslim members of the community. And I wonder if that surprises you or, you know, how you\u2019ve experienced that to happen, and how that participation of people from other faiths adds to the knowledge to your sense of what this means or your theology or anthropology. It\u2019s important. And I\u2019m glad you began by saying Catholic. See, catholic means universal. Yes. Right. And \u2026 Catholic with a small c. Yeah. It is \u2013 catholicism is an openness. You see the heart of God is open. But there was a tendency when I was younger \u2014 when I left the navy \u2014 of Catholicism where there was a sort of wall around it, of the right and the wrong and the better and the best and all that sort of stuff. And it\u2019s really very interesting the history of L\u2019Arche. History of L\u2019Arche is the relationship between a vision or a principle and experience. What has experience taught us? That for instance Nadia is a Muslim \u2014 Moroccan \u2014 lady in the community next door, and I see her quite regularly. And I love listening to her. And I love hearing what she\u2019s saying of how she\u2019s discovering the heart and relationship. How she\u2019s discovering the depth of the Qur\u2019an. Rakhi is the head of our community in Calcutta, she\u2019s Hindu. I could sit at the feet of that woman and listen to her. She is amazing. Like the last time I saw her was about a year ago and she was telling me that in Calcutta, they were having difficulty, we\u2019re in a tough area of Calcutta. And she was saying that many of our people with disabilities were being laughed at and people were throwing stones at them. And she said something was going wrong. We were being rejected by the \u2014 so we decided, she said in the community, to do a play, a theater. And that we would take one of Tagore\u2019s stories. And the Tagore story was a story between somebody who was a very liberal on the religious and a very \u2014 another man who was very conservative and how they were in conflict and how gradual reconciliation came. She said, we did this and there were 300 people from a local area, and they\u2019ve changed. So it\u2019s \u2014 what I\u2019ve discovered as I\u2019ve listened to Rakhi or I\u2019ve listened to Nadia, the relation between the principle and the experience has been a sort of movement in L\u2019Arche over 40 years. And, you know, you could \u2014 I could have difficulty with some of the changes or difficulty with discovering that experience is important. Sometimes, you want to clutch on to principles and yet experience is saying go further, go further. Another, you know, a piece of wisdom I think about L\u2019Arche is, as you say, its presence, the physical presence. I \u2014 this is another conversation I have with people all the time in different context that the world\u2019s pain comes to people in Western cultures often through their television sets or through reading some horrific story in a newspaper or seeing an absolutely heartbreaking picture, you know, like a picture I saw of an Iraqi child crying at a funeral the other week that haunted me for days. And yet, there\u2019s nothing I can do for that Iraqi child, you know? He\u2019s thousands of miles away. I think I\u2019m also aware that it\u2019s not only that I can\u2019t touch his pain or the sources of it directly. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t know his sources of solace. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to help him get up the next day and somehow start to heal. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m throwing that out \u2026 You\u2019re seeing this \u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s \u2014 you see, we are in an incredible world of technology, the global world. And yet, with television and even with cell phones and Internet, we can cut away from relationship, you see? To get an email, you don\u2019t see the eyes of the person, you don\u2019t see the face, you don\u2019t see the smile, you don\u2019t see the hands, you don\u2019t see the tone of voice. And we have to come down to small is beautiful because small is where we really \u2026 Isn\u2019t it funny that global technology may bring us back to small is beautiful. Possibly. Or take us away from it. As I had said, you see, I mean, as you look at that Iraqi child and you were wounded and wanted to do something, yet, you were confronted by your incapacity because the child was not in front of you. If that child was in front of you, you could have taken the child in your arms. So we\u2019re going into a world where the imagination, the virtual, the long distance, see things far away appear as close. But you can\u2019t touch them. They\u2019re close to the imagination, but they\u2019re not close to the body. So let\u2019s come back to the reality of the small. There, we can \u2026 Like the people who live down the street from us. We can touch them, we can be with them. The difficulty with L\u2019Arche, which is also a beauty \u2014 I say it\u2019s our difficulty, it\u2019s our beauty, is that it\u2019s small and it\u2019s just very little and it \u2026 And it\u2019s small, and yet the story of L\u2019Arche is that from one community in France, you are now all over the world. You\u2019re in Africa. You\u2019re in Bangladesh. You\u2019ve talked about Calcutta, some of the places you\u2019ve mentioned. Yes. L\u2019Arche has grown. But the reality of every day is sometimes quite painful in the smallness in a world where people are being pushed to pretend that they\u2019re big. I think it is, it\u2019s deeply countercultural that you say repeatedly, you don\u2019t want with L\u2019Arche to change the world. That\u2019s not the goal. What we can do is what Gandhi says, we can\u2019t change the world, but I can change. And if I change, and I seek to be more open to people and less frightened of relationship, if I begin to see what is beautiful within them, if I recognize also that there\u2019s brokenness because I\u2019m also broken, and that\u2019s OK, then there\u2019s something that begins to happen. But it\u2019s so counterculture but that doesn\u2019t matter. What has happened, what I sense for the future of our poor little world, with all its ecological difficulties and financial difficulties, that maybe the big thing that\u2019s going to happen is that little lights of love will spread over the country. Little places where people love each other, and welcome the poor and the broken. Where each other, we give to each other their gifts, and have these little, little places. And that the world is, you know, we\u2019ll never hit the headlines but we\u2019ll be creating these little lamps. And if there are sufficient number of little, little lamps in each village or each city and parts of the city, well then the glow will be a little bit greater. What is it you\u2019ve said that L\u2019Arche is not meant to be a solution but a sign. Yes, we can\u2019t. You see, once I was speaking to a man in a big city in the United States. He said, \u2018Give me the formula and I\u2019ll create 300 L\u2019Arches in the next two years.\u2019 I said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s a transmission of a vision and it\u2019s counter culture. But that\u2019s OK. Who we are, who we are.\u2019 I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today: exploring Jean Vanier\u2019s understanding of religious virtue, the pain of the world, and \u201CThe Wisdom of Tenderness.\u201D I\u2019m sitting with you outside Washington and you\u2019re meeting with \u2014 you\u2019ve been spending the weekend leading a retreat with college students. And I wonder both what they teach you \u2014 I sense that you are a person who encounters other human beings as you talk often about standing with humility before humanity and learning. And so what do you learn from them? And I\u2019m also curious about at this stage in your life, at 79. What insights are you through what\u2019s happening in your body, the aging of your body, the encounter with frailty that we all have it as the other end of life? How has that changing you? I have two questions. Two questions. Yeah. Two questions. Yeah, the beauty of young people is their openness, their yearning, their enthusiasm. On the other hand, a feeling of discouragement because the machine is too big, machine of the world. Kind of what we\u2019ve been talking about, yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s too big. So there\u2019s an immense yearning, thirst, but also a fear of commitment. Of course, in some ways, they\u2019ve been too manipulated. I can think of my adolescence some \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 60 or more years ago and, in a way, things were much simpler. Today, with the technology, this excitement, and yet we\u2019re losing the sense of what it means to be human. This brings me back to the second question \u2026 OK. \u2026 which is that I\u2019m human. And I have my weaknesses and I have my fragility, physical ailments of the heart, I have to take things quietly. And intellectually, I get tired much more quickly. So it\u2019s just the acceptance of reality. And you see, the big thing for me is to love reality and not live in the imagination, not live in what could have been or what should have been or what can be to this reality, and somewhere to love reality and then discover that God is present in the reality. That doesn\u2019t mean to say that we\u2019re just to be passive to welcome reality, because we also have to know how to react in front of reality. Reality is a beautiful reality, but how to just to live that reality and live it with my own body, my own weaknesses, my own need for greater sleep, to get to sleep after lunch and all the rest of \u2014 and this is my reality. And I know that in so many years\u2019, time \u2014 would it be five years \u2014I might be in a wheelchair, or whatever it is. I mean I am somebody who\u2019s moving towards that ultimate reality, which is much closer, which is death. And my secretary, Barbara, who is my secretary for 40 years, died last July. We held hands together for two hours and she just left. And not to be frightened of death. Death is a passage, which will be an extraordinary discovery, something that\u2019ll be so amazing that we can\u2019t even imagine it. It\u2019s like my little niece who died of AIDS, and she wasn\u2019t a believer. She said, \u2018What it\u2019s going to be like?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to fall asleep. And when you wake up, you\u2019ll be in such joy, such peace. Something that you\u2019ve never, never lived before.\u2019 And she said, \u2018But I\u2019m not a believer.\u2019 I said, \u2018But you remember when you\u2019re in that apartment in Paris and there were some Turkish immigrants that you make cakes for them. I\u2019ve always seen you as somebody kind. And so your kindness you\u2019ll find, it\u2019ll be OK. And then the rest we will discover. It\u2019s going to be exciting. It\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u2019 This is another something you know, clearly. You know this. And all of your philosophy, all of your studies can\u2019t explain that to you, something you know. Yes. Something that we have experienced \u2014 you see, if you just experience somewhere the peace of Jesus, the peace of being with other people, the peace of loving people. Well \u2014 and that experience transcends everything, the ideas we might have, because it\u2019s that experience where we live trust. And in Greek, the word \u201Cfaith\u201D and \u201Ctrust\u201D are the same word. Trust in other people, trust in God, trust in the peace that is in our hearts, trust also in those who are struggling to find peace and who got their angers and their pain. That\u2019s OK too. We\u2019re in it together. I just want to ask you one more question. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t enjoy being reminded that like Mother Teresa, in her lifetime, people said she was a saint, and in Jean Vanier\u2019s lifetime, they\u2019re saying that you are a saint. And I don\u2019t sense that a lot of energy has been put into becoming a saint. There was this great shock recently that in Mother Teresa\u2019s letters were revealed that she struggled with darkness and depression, and I wonder how you responded to that and \u2026 There are, again, number of questions. Yeah, it\u2019s a number of questions. What I respond to that \u2026 Yes. \u2026 is I knew Mother quite well. Yes. She was a fantastic woman. I\u2019d have breakfast with her and she\u2019d be telling me about her foundation in Yemen and how she was hoping to get to China and what she was doing in Africa and so on. She might have had difficulties in praying but never, never, never did she have the slightest doubt in her mission. Mm-hmm. I mean I think somehow the astonishment over that is connected to what you\u2019ve just said that you are all about loving reality, and she was facing reality. She may have been a saint by some definition, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she was removed from darkness. In fact, it means that she was actually touching it and facing it and grappling with \u2026 She had a lot of anguish, you see? And to bring anguish, which she had, and then to think that it doubted her faith, she never doubted her faith, but in her prayer that she lived anguish. This is what everybody lives. I mean it\u2019s \u2014 this is human reality. And I think when Mother Teresa was writing and telling these \u2014 and I still feel upset because she said that should be destroyed. And we didn\u2019t take seriously what she had said. But she was obviously a woman of great anguish. And so when you\u2019re a great anguished, your prayer will be anguished. I mean don\u2019t be surprised and don\u2019t make a big thing out of it. I mean this is the reality of everyone. And she\u2019s telling us now stop thinking about this anguish. Just get on and start loving people. We must listen to what she said, which was we will be healed by the poor. So let\u2019s get down to it. OK. All right. All right. Thank you. Is there anything you want to say about being compared to her as a living saint? Sanctity put it in \u2014 what is important is just to become a little friend of Jesus. OK. That\u2019s your last word. Thank you very much. Jean Vanier is founder of the L\u2019Arche Federation, which is celebrating its 50th year in 2015. He now lives full-time in the original L\u2019Arche community in Trosly-Breuil, France. His books include Befriending the Stranger, The Story of L\u2019Arche, and Signs of the Times."
