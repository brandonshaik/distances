  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. My guest today is Leila Ahmed, an Egyptian-born Harvard scholar. Her personal history parallels some of the defining political and social currents of our time. She offers a lively, learned, and provocative challenge to current controversies about Muslim dress and to basic Western assumptions about Islam and the Muslim world and women. You know, when people think about Muslim women, they think of the image of Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan. Why is that, when 90 percent of the Muslim world does not wear any of this stuff? And why is it that I never get called by a journalist \u2014 I get constantly called and asked to explain why Islam oppresses women; I have never yet been asked, \u2018Why is it that Islam has produced seven women prime ministers or heads of state and Europe only two or three?\u2019 or whatever it is. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Is Western concern about women and Islam really a concern for the well-being of women? Is the veil a symptom of their problems or of ours? My guest this hour, Leila Ahmed, provides essential historical background and challenges my thinking. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CMuslim Women and Other Misunderstandings.\u201D In recent months, controversy has broken out across Western Europe over the religious dress and head coverings of Muslim women. France, for example, passed a law keeping religious symbols out of its schools, principally aimed at the Muslim headscarf. The Italian government, citing domestic terrorism laws, has prohibited face coverings. Some German states have banned public school teachers from wearing headscarves. My guest, Leila Ahmed, is a professor at Harvard Divinity School and one of the most incisive contemporary scholars of women and gender in Islam. She\u2019s also lived through some of the defining passages of recent religious and political history. She was born in Egypt in the waning days of the British Empire. The notion of the Arab world, and of Egyptians as part of that, had not yet been invented. But in our time, we refer to the Arab world as a fact of history and geography. We take it for granted and interchange it with another newly invented term, the Islamic world. Yes. Well, look, for one thing, I no longer believe that there\u2019s an Islamic world, because where exactly are the borders? Are they in Chicago? Where are they? Where does the Islamic world end and where does the West begin? Is it in Paris, or where is it? So I do think what happens in this country is going to be as much about the Islamic world as whatever happens over there. The Islamic world is no longer over there. That\u2019s one thing. The other thing is, I think what we do, what we Americans do, will profoundly determine what becomes of what we\u2019re calling Islamic world. When it comes to analyzing Muslim women, Leila Ahmed says, Westerners need to question the most basic assumptions they hold. We tend to focus on Muslim clothing and headdress as a symbol of root problems. This has a long history, which she has traced. When Prime Minister Tony Blair recently called the Islamic full-face veil a \u201Cmark of separation,\u201D he echoed a 19th-century British missionary who famously described Muslim women as \u201Cburied alive behind the veil.\u201D Leila Ahmed has watched Western attitudes echo these patterns of the past ever since 9/11. What we\u2019re living through right now is so startling to me in some ways, partly because it seems to repeat history in a very disturbing way. And what I mean is it was extraordinary for me to turn on the television during the Afghan war and see women throwing off the veil, or see endless programs on CNN on the veil, see Laura Bush speaking about women in Afghanistan and liberating them. And what was disturbing there was to see the replay of what the British Empire did in Egypt 100 years ago. And it was almost hard to believe. Tell that story. Well, what I need to invoke here is the belief at the end of the 19th century that the veil symbolized the oppression of Muslim women. It\u2019s part of the mythology of that era in which whatever was being done in another country, the countries that they dominated, whether it was India or sub-Saharan Africa or the Muslim countries, however the women dressed there it was the wrong thing. In sub-Saharan Africa, they didn\u2019t wear enough clothes; they didn\u2019t dress the way European Victorian women dressed. In the Middle East, they wore too many clothes. So the veil in the West in relation to Islam became the emblem of how uncivilized Islam was and, on the other hand, how civilized Europeans were. But the other twist that we need to remember at this moment in history, you know, Victorian dress was hardly the most liberated dress. That\u2019s right. And you point out that, even as Victorian women had thoughts of liberation and emancipation or, I don\u2019t know, just progress, no one suggested that they had to discard Victorian dress for that of some other culture entirely. That\u2019s right. Exactly. And the wonderful example there, too, is that Lord Cromer, who was the governor of Egypt at the end of the 19th century, early 20th century, and he was the most vociferous advocate of how important it was that Muslim women unveil \u2014 and by the way, you can see a parallel, he was the Lord Bremer of that day, you know? I mean, not Lord Bremer. Oh, Paul Bremer? You know, Paul Bremer of his day. The Iraqi coalition forces or what\u2026 Yes. He was in charge of our presence in Iraq after they actively entered\u2026 Exactly. Exactly. He was conducting Iraq. So his equivalent figure 100 years ago was Lord Cromer in Egypt. But he was, you know, telling people how Egyptian society ought to be, and the first thing that had to be done was women had to throw off the veil because, until then, the men would not become civilized. He didn\u2019t care about the women. Women had to throw off the veil so that Muslim men could become civilized, so they could raise civilized young boys who became civilized men. They would be like good British mothers. Now, on the other hand, this same man, Lord Cromer, who was making such a big fuss about liberating Muslim women, in England he was the president and founder of the Society Opposed to Women\u2019s Suffrage. He didn\u2019t think women ought to have the vote. He thought Victorian society was perfect as it was, with a patriarch ruling over everything, and that is a society that ought to be spread across the world. And in the name of that, Muslim women had to unveil. And, I mean, before that, before the 19th century, the veil had quite different connotations, didn\u2019t it, than what it has today? I mean, it was something that upper-class women wore at that time? That\u2019s right. Now, I think we need to also distinguish what we mean by \u201Cveil,\u201D because the head covering for women was the norm throughout the Muslim world, and actually head covering for men too was the norm. Yes. So that is often called the veil, and that\u2019s what nowadays we see as called the veil. It\u2019s a head covering, usually not a facial veil. And the face veil, in addition to the head covering, was worn by upper-class women. Everybody, though, wore a head veil. I mean, that was just normal dress. Everybody meaning men and women. Yes. Although, I mean, I can\u2019t think of a man going bareheaded, but I don\u2019t know if there was a law preventing them from going \u2014 I don\u2019t think that was a law either for women. I mean, you also tell \u2014 I had not read this \u2014 that the veil during Muhammad\u2019s lifetime was used heavily in the Christian Middle East and Mediterranean. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. So this was actually something originally that Islam took from Christian culture, the Christian culture around it. From Christian culture and from whatever other cultures were there. I mean, the veil was the norm in Iran, which wasn\u2019t Christian, it was Zoroastrian. It was also a norm in the Christian Middle East. So it seems to have been a form of dress normal for particularly the upper classes of the region throughout, regardless of what religion they were. Jewish women too, Christian women, Zoroastrian women, that was just the norm of dress. So obviously this original impulse against the veil was initiated by Westerners, as you say, people like Lord Cromer, also missionaries. That\u2019s right. But it wasn\u2019t necessarily about making women\u2019s lives better. I think the idea\u2019s been politically manipulated, that\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s used as a way of putting down Islam, supposedly because Islam oppresses women. You know, whenever you see the veil now prominently discussed in Western society, its implication is, \u2018We are the superior civilization, Islam is an inferior civilization which deserves to be eradicated.\u2019 That is all summed up in the symbolism of the veil. It\u2019s not about women at all, I think. You know, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always so extreme, but there is a sense that, let\u2019s say, women in this country would feel sorry for Islamic women based on seeing them in that kind of dress. Yes, I think you\u2019re right, that it\u2019s not as deliberate and manipulative as it seems to be. I don\u2019t know how to explain, but let me try to by saying, you know, when people think about Muslim women, they think of the image of Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan. Now, why\u2026 They think of the burqas, don\u2019t they? Yes. That\u2019s right. But why is that, when 90 percent of the Muslim world does not wear any of this stuff? I mean, why is it that I never get called by a journalist \u2014 I get constantly called and asked to explain why Islam oppresses women; I have never yet been called and asked, \u2018Why is it that Islam has produced seven women prime ministers or heads of state and Europe only two or three?\u2019 or whatever it is. And America none. That\u2019s right. So what is it that is always focused on as the face of Islam and women? So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really entirely innocent. I think it\u2019s about political power and how we want to represent Islam. Scholar and author Leila Ahmed of the Harvard Divinity School. She\u2019s one of the first Muslim women on the faculty of a major American divinity school. She had a comfortable, sophisticated upbringing in Cairo and attended university at Cambridge. In the intellectual, professional, and governing classes of the Egypt of her childhood, she writes, there seemed no contradiction between pursuing independence from the European powers and deeply admiring their institutions. But in half a century, she\u2019s seen that culture transformed. Let\u2019s talk about your experience. I mean, you grew up in Egypt. The women in your family didn\u2019t wear the veil, did they? No. Well, my grandmother wore a head veil. Mm-hmm. You live in this country now, you write about women\u2019s issues, you know many American feminists. I wonder how you, as someone who grew up in that culture, not wearing the veil, thinks differently about those kinds of images than some of your American-born colleagues? That\u2019s a very interesting question because I too actually react against the veil. I grew up in a society where women did not veil. They were Muslims but they didn\u2019t veil. And so the veil for me connotes a particular kind of Islam. I used to think of it \u2014 I no longer do \u2014 I used to think of it as a very dogmatic and fundamentalist type of Islam. So that is my associations. Unlike when Americans see a woman in a veil might think, \u2018Well, this is just a Muslim custom,\u2019 that never occurs to me. I know it\u2019s not a Muslim custom, having lived it. I know that many \u2014 you know, many millions of Muslim women do not and have not worn it for, you know, 40 or 50 or 60 years. What do you mean when you say that you used to think of that as a very dogmatic and fundamentalist expression of Islam but you don\u2019t anymore? Well, I\u2019ll tell you, it was in my own lifetime, as a young person, the people who wore it were people who were affiliated with Muslim fundamentalist groups, or they were affiliated with groups whose origins were in Saudi Arabia and who were fundamentalists from where I stood. But nowadays, if you talk to young American women who wear hijab or veil or a headscarf of some kind, they\u2019re not fundamentalists. Some of them are passionate feminists. So its meaning is changing in America today. In America, but isn\u2019t it also changing in some Islamic countries\u2026 Yes, it is. \u2026that new generations of young women who are university-educated are making that as a choice? You know, there have been endless books analyzing why on earth is this happening, why are they doing this? Class was one issue, that it was easier for people moving particularly from villages to the city to assume a very modest style of dress, to show that they were not departing from their traditions. All sorts of reasons are being advanced for it. I really can\u2019t find myself thinking that it would have happened if Saudi Arabia had not had a lot of money and had it not been pouring money everywhere into promoting its kind of Islam. Maybe what I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s no single source for why this is happening. Right. But you do have ideas about what these young women are feeling about the veil as they choose it, and that it can be a form of public power and freedom. Whereas I think if \u2014 when a Western woman \u2014 many Western women see an image of a woman with the veil, they assume that it\u2019s this kind of retreat from reality or a symbol of submission in a way that would have negative connotations in our culture. Yes. I mean, you would know better than I do how a Western woman is reacting to it, and I think you\u2019re absolutely right. That\u2019s not an assumption I would ever make, that it is about submission. I don\u2019t think it is about submission at all. Certainly not among the young. What is it about, then, if not submission? Well, it depends, you know, what country we\u2019re talking about, because its meaning clearly changes by country. Because if you are a minority and you wear the veil, you\u2019re making a statement about your being willing to take a stand for your beliefs against the current of the majority. And that\u2019s a very courageous thing to do. It\u2019s very different \u2014 if I were living in Saudi Arabia and put on a headscarf, it would mean something completely different. If I\u2019m living in Egypt, where there\u2019s probably a lot of social pressure even among the majority to wear it, it would mean something different. So I think we need to analyze it in relation to where is it that this person is putting it on? Now, one of the things I\u2019m leaving out of this \u2014 and I should not be perhaps \u2014 is some people, no doubt, are wearing it because they believe God wants them to. But I don\u2019t know how one gauges that exactly. Right. I mean, I think those words I used a little while ago about an expression of public power and freedom could also be linked to a sense of piety or a sense of Islam as empowering in their lives. I don\u2019t know. Go on a bit. What do you mean? Well, I don\u2019t think there necessarily has to be a contradiction between a woman feeling empowered and feeling devout. And that is a link that a lot of Westerners maybe wouldn\u2019t make to it. I see. Yes, I think you\u2019re right. Yes. I mean, the whole language of submission, which is so central to Islam, it\u2019s very difficult just linguistically in an American ear, right? Especially for American women. Well, you know, it\u2019s partly because I\u2019m in the divinity, for when you say that, what I hear most is the number of graduate students I know who have worked or who are working, who are Christian, on the role of submission in Christian women, having put up with being \u2014 you know, priests tell women, \u2018Well, if a husband beats you, it\u2019s your duty to accept it.\u2019 So\u2026 Right. How teachings about submission in Christianity worked against women. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Yes. But, I mean, my point is, also, that in Islam the word \u201Csubmission,\u201D which, again, also is a translated word, I don\u2019t know what connotations just that word has for you and your ears. Yes. I mean, as you know, it\u2019s a translated word, and the word Islam in Arabic, it\u2019s a derivative of the word \u201Cpeace.\u201D So there\u2019s no notion of peace in submission, to me, in the English word \u201Csubmission.\u201D I mean, so the resonance of Eslam or Islam, it\u2019s a resonance of acceptance, of something good. \u201CSubmission\u201D is a harsh word in English, it\u2019s about bowing to and being forced to bow to something. Whereas Islam and Eslam, which means to become Muslim, to accept Islam, has none of that resonance at all. I think these are small details \u2014 they\u2019re not really small, I think they\u2019re key. I think they\u2019re vital, actually. No, because, to me, the word \u201Csubmission\u201D doesn\u2019t translate to Islam, so it\u2019s not small, but it\u2019s what we live with ordinarily as if it were an equivalent word, and it isn\u2019t. Writer and scholar Leila Ahmed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CMuslim Women and Other Misunderstandings.\u201D At speakingoffaith.org, you can hear more of Leila Ahmed\u2019s recollections of how the Arab and Muslim identity of Egyptians was created in her childhood. In her memoir, she also describes the Islamic sensibility that she learned from the women in her household in that era. The ethical vision of Islam, she says, is traditionally more a way of being than believing. Here\u2019s a passage from that work, evoking summers spent in her mother\u2019s family home in Alexandria. \u201CIt is easy to see now that our lives in the Alexandria house were lived in women\u2019s time, women\u2019s space. And in women\u2019s culture. And the women had, too, I now believe, their own understanding of Islam, an understanding that was different from men\u2019s Islam, \u2018official\u2019 Islam. For although in those days it was only Grandmother who performed all the regular formal prayers, for all the women of the house, religion was an essential part of how they made sense of and understood their own lives. It was through religion that one pondered the things that happened, why they had happened, and what one should make of them. \u201CIslam, as I got it from them, was gentle, generous, pacifist, inclusive, somewhat mystical \u2014 just as they themselves were. .Religion was, above all, about inner things. The outward signs of religiousness such as prayer and fasting might be signs of a true religiousness . but equally well might not. They were certainly not what was important about being Muslim. What was important was how you conducted yourself and how you were in yourself and in your attitude toward others and in your heart.\u201D From Leila Ahmed\u2019s memoir, A Border Passage. There was no book that I ever read that told me, \u2018This is what\u2019s important,\u2019 but that is the message that we got simply from being alive. And actually, I can give you an example of the way that Islam is changing in our times, a talk I heard given by someone in Chicago, University of Chicago, who had studied Muslims in America since 1980 to the present. And in the course of her talk, she said, \u2018When I first asked them in the early \u201980s what Islam meant,\u2019 they said to her, \u2018Well, it\u2019s about how you behave. You have to be ethical, you have to treat people well.\u2019 \u2018And that\u2019s all they could tell me,\u2019 she says. \u2018Now, after many years of preachers coming from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, now they know exactly what Islam is. And what is Islam? It\u2019s the five pillars of Islam. It\u2019s this doctrine and that creed, and this is how you recite it and this is what you do.\u2019 So it\u2019s a huge shift, and I think it was how people lived it and how they understood it. I think that this daily lived piety that is Islamic spirituality also \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve felt, as I\u2019ve come to understand that, that that\u2019s part of what has made it so hard for Muslims to talk about Islam since 9/11, which they were put in a position where they felt that they had to do that. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s a marvelous point, actually. You\u2019re absolutely right. That\u2019s exactly the issue there. And, actually, you know, another little detail there, it\u2019s actually about people in Muslim societies who are not necessarily Muslim. Because I suspect that the feelings that I had as to what Islam meant were exactly what my Christian friends thought that Christianity meant growing up in Egypt, and my Jewish friends thought. So I think it\u2019s part of the ethos of what was Islamic civilization, and it\u2019s common to all the religions, to Hindus who grew up in a Muslim environment. So I think it\u2019s about a whole different way of relating to the world and understanding what religion is and how one lives. You said that in Egypt today, there\u2019s a great social pressure to wear the veil now. I mean, I just wanted to ask you, what has happened in that culture that in your lifetime there\u2019s now this different social pressure for women? What does it mean to the women you know there? Well, I think I need to say two things. One is that I haven\u2019t been going back much, so I read about what\u2019s happened in that society. But, you know, there\u2019s none of the analyses that I\u2019ve seen that don\u2019t have politics at the heart of it. You know, I\u2019ve lived in America now for 25 years, and I experience America as having dramatically changed in the matters of religion and in relation to women. And I don\u2019t know if I would call it a more pious country now, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say that, but certainly religion is much more in the air and much more important and much more powerful. Are people more deeply religious in some sense? I doubt it, actually. But I don\u2019t know how you would speak about how your experience in America is. Well, there\u2019s a different kind of public expression and a kind of energy that maybe was below the surface, which is out on the surface now. Was it there below the surface? I think it was. But, I mean, I think the point you\u2019re making is just to remind us that there\u2019s a parallel surge of religious energy, or of visible religious energy, in our culture, which we observe in what we call the Muslim world. Yes. But also, I think I\u2019m trying to suggest that I don\u2019t experience it in America as separate from politics. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about people having become more deeply religious, I think it\u2019s about who has the power more. OK. And I think very much that\u2019s the case anyway in the Muslim world, about a shift in power, partly because of the amount of money that the most religious fundamentalist countries have had. The oil money has been chiefly fundamentalist. Egyptian-American writer and scholar Leila Ahmed. This is Speaking of Faith.

Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CMuslim Women and Other Misunderstandings.\u201D I\u2019m speaking with Egyptian-American writer and scholar Leila Ahmed. She\u2019s one of the most incisive contemporary scholars of women and gender in Islam, and the first Muslim woman on the faculty of Harvard Divinity School. She\u2019s offering a provocative critique of American perceptions about the Islamic world in general and Muslim women in particular. She first came to question her own assumptions about such things when she set out to write her life story in the 1990s. The religious dynamics of her native country, Egypt, have changed dramatically in her lifetime, but she knows the complexity that lies in its history and its people. Here\u2019s a reading from a chapter in her memoir entitled \u201CHarem.\u201D She\u2019s recalling formative times spent in the company of extended circles of women in her family. \u201CLooking back now, with the assumptions of my own time, I could well conclude that the ethos of the world whose attitude survived into my own childhood must have been an ethos in which women were regarded as inferior creatures. \u2026But my memories do not fit with such a picture. I simply do not think that the message I got from the women \u2026 was that we, the girls, and they, the women, were inferior. But what, then, was the message? I don\u2019t think it was a simple one. \u201C\u2026It is quite possible that while the women did not think of themselves and of us as inferior, the men did, although \u2014 given how powerful the cultural imperative of respect for parents, particularly the mother, was among those people \u2014 even for men such a view could not have been altogether uncomplicated. But men and women certainly did live essentially separate, almost unconnected lives. \u2026 Living differently and separately and coming together only momentarily, the two sexes inhabited different if sometimes overlapping cultures, a men\u2019s and a women\u2019s culture, each sex seeing and understanding and representing the world to itself quite differently.\u201D From the memoir A Border Passage by my guest today, Leila Ahmed. Now back to our conversation. You have a chapter in your memoir which you call \u201CHarem.\u201D You know, there\u2019s another word that kind of comes down to us through literature and fairy tales, and also it\u2019s kind of an image of what we think might be wrong and might have always been wrong with women in, you know, Middle Eastern Arabic societies, right? Yeah. The chapter you write, then, that you title \u201CHarem,\u201D is really about the closeness of women in the circles in which you grew up. I mean, what do you think of \u2014 I mean, I\u2019d love to hear a story or a particular people when you use the word \u201Charem.\u201D Well, as I describe there, it actually is a very warm and \u2014 it\u2019s a wonderful environment because it was about being with all the women of the family and the children very comfortably. There was usually, you know, at least half a dozen aunts and grandmother and so on. Let me say a couple of things, which is not a story about that world, but about how people have responded to me here, which is that people have said to me, \u2018Well, you know what, that\u2019s what it was like when I was a kid in my family in Vermont\u2019 or in Minnesota, or wherever it is. Because we did gather, it was the women who gathered. We\u2019d gather in the kitchen, or we\u2019d be \u2014 and there would be that atmosphere of free discussion and talking that I describe as being part of what it was to be in a women\u2019s community in Cairo, where I grew up, or Alexandria. That this is actually a common experience of many societies just before we became nuclear families, each of us in our little boxes. That a lot of people have these memories of families being extended families, and of people, you know, dividing up by sex to talk about whatever their interests were. Right. What does the word \u201Charem\u201D mean? Well, it means women\u2019s quarters. That\u2019s what it means. Yeah. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the concubines\u2019 room. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean the concubines\u2019 room, no. That was a Western male fantasy. They invented what it was that harems meant. All the Western men who traveled to the Muslim world who were unable to get into a harem had fantasies as to what was going on in there. So this is where our American heritage of the word \u201Charem\u201D comes. But, you know, I do think that it\u2019s true, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but in \u2014 and again, you\u2019re going to say every Muslim country is different, every culture is different \u2014 but that in Muslim cultures that there is a greater separation between men and women now than there is here. I think that\u2019s probably true. That\u2019s probably true, yes. That\u2019s something that Americans will look at, American feminists, and say, \u2018That\u2019s a problem.\u2019 Is that a problem, in your mind? No, it isn\u2019t. I mean, first thing that comes to my mind if you say American feminists would say it\u2019s a problem, they probably would, but, on the other hand, what was striking to me when I first came to this country was that people kept telling me about these wonderful consciousness-raising groups that they had, and I said, \u2018Well, what are they?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Well, you know, women get together and talk about their experiences.\u2019 So apparently it was a very powerful thing for the American feminist movement for women to get together without men and talk. So why is it that when women get together in other countries, we\u2019re unable to see that that\u2019s women getting together and talking? We think it\u2019s a bad thing. I don\u2019t quite know. I don\u2019t know if feminists are quite primitive now, even, I mean American feminists, whether they have got to the point of understanding that there\u2019s good use and insight in being able to get together and criticize, which is what a lot of Muslim women do when they get together, either the political system or the men in their families or the conduct of men and so on. I think we also look at Islamic fundamentalism and see men off on their own without women, and find that to be dangerous. I mean, that\u2019s the other side of that story. Yes, that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s not dangerous if it \u2014 unfortunately, they have fundamentalist men and, you know, they have power, so that\u2019s what\u2019s dangerous. I don\u2019t care if they get together; they\u2019re welcome to do so. Right. But if they keep hold of all the power, that\u2019s what scares me, and that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like. And I\u2019m glad you make that point because there is no necessary connection between fundamentalism and a slightly segregated society. Fundamentalism is hideous. I mean, I think it\u2019s a very dangerous thing, fundamentalist ways of looking at society. But I don\u2019t think \u2014 until we have a perfect world, I don\u2019t think some slight segregation is so terrible. You\u2019re talking about segregation between men and women. Between men and women, yeah. But, I mean, it does vary, as you said to begin with, across Muslim countries. And I think one of the problems of a country, say, like Egypt is facing now is that, in fact, there is a breakdown of the extended family, and that\u2019s causing havoc because women have to go to work. They used to be able to leave their children with their mothers or their mother\u2019s sisters or somebody. You know, the network of women is no longer there. So I don\u2019t think the segregation is anything like \u2014 or the possibility of women \u2014 links between women is anything like as strong as it used to be. I mean, if you had to say, from your perspective, what you do worry about for women in the Islamic world \u2014 there I go generalizing again \u2014 I mean, what comes to your mind? And again, you know, not issues of poverty or what you talked about, the breakdown of the extended family, I mean, we have that in this culture, too \u2014 but what do you worry about that is related to the religion of Islam? Well, obviously fundamentalism being entrenched in power. That is very dangerous and very frightening. But how does one exactly separate, I mean, I can\u2019t quite remove poverty because if there were no poverty, the situation would be completely different. I wouldn\u2019t be as frightened as I am. But I do think, in many countries, Islam is used as a way of justifying outrageous behavior, and the combination of poverty, of lack of education, makes it impossible to speak out against that or for women to know that this is not Islam. So I can\u2019t quite remove poverty and lack of education from\u2026 Well, you know, I would like to turn that question around to you. When you think about America, what do you fear most for women? Probably the same things you just described. That we don\u2019t have any support to take care of our children and go out to work, and that there are a lot of women living in poverty, and I don\u2019t really know how they get through the days, honestly. Yes. Yes, I agree with you. Now, do we fear fundamentalism for America too? I mean, are we afraid of what happens in the Supreme Court, of what abortion rights going to happen? You know, are these fears only for over there? Creationism? I think it\u2019s easy to politicize some of what\u2019s happening and make it seem more frightening than it in fact is. But when I was reading your book, it was very striking to me, the incredible social upheaval that you lived through. I mean, the real transformation of your culture, of Egypt. That happened over time, right? And I mean, there were dramatic moments. I mean, there were wars that were fought and lost and political changes, but all of it resulted in a complete transformation. And that did, in fact, make me think about how we take very much for granted the idea that whatever happens here, it will be OK, that we will basically come out in the same place with the same system. Yeah. But people in other cultures have a different experience. You have a different experience of how the world can change around you. That\u2019s right. But, you know, I used to think that about America that things would be always OK, but the last few years have been very frightening. Egyptian-American writer and scholar Leila Ahmed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, today in conversation with Leila Ahmed about \u201CMuslim Women and Other Misunderstandings.\u201D I mean, I think it\u2019s really interesting that we\u2019re having a conversation about what frightens you about women and the Islamic world, and you\u2019re telling me that that\u2019s not the only place you\u2019re looking now. Yes. Well, look, for one thing, I no longer believe that there\u2019s an Islamic world, because where exactly are the borders? Are they in Chicago? Where are they? Where does the Islamic world end and where does the West begin? Is it in Paris, or where is it? So I do think what happens in this country is going to be as much about the Islamic world as whatever happens over there. The Islamic world is no longer over there, that\u2019s one thing. The other thing is, I think what we do, what we Americans do, will profoundly determine what becomes of what we\u2019re calling Islamic world. Who our allies have been has been very important. I think of Saudi Arabia, the country that America\u2019s been most staunchly allied with for decades. I mean, I think, in some ways, my native country, Egypt, has been decimated in part because of the flow of petrol dollars into Egypt, which has given rise to fundamentalism. We saw terrible terrorism attacks throughout the \u201990s in Egypt, partly fueled, my guess is, by money from that region. I don\u2019t think we would have witnessed what we\u2019ve witnessed. But \u2014 so there\u2019s no \u2014 it\u2019s not what will Egypt do or what will Saudi Arabia do? What will American do is absolutely vital to what becomes of our world collectively. It\u2019s no longer borders, really. I mean, so that\u2019s where \u2014 you\u2019re looking at how other countries see us and seeing a very different way to critique the present and to describe what has gone wrong. That Saudi Arabia has been such a huge ally to the United States is a problem for us in the Muslim world, you\u2019re saying. Yes. It\u2019s a problem for us here. We\u2019ve got terrorism here in this country. A lot of them are Saudis. So I\u2019m saying that there\u2019s no place where one can say, you know, America\u2019s here and Islam is over there, and what we do over there doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s going to touch us directly here. And it touches the rest of the world too. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re insulated, and I think it\u2019s \u2014 what we do shapes the world, at home and abroad. As you watch the American presence in Iraq, we\u2019re engaged there, we are implicated in and involved in the creation of a new Iraqi government, a new Iraqi system and perhaps culture. What would you like Americans to be thinking about and watching for in terms of women, but also just the preservation of what you think of as the best of Islamic sensibility, what you often refer to as the ethical sensibility of Islam? Well, if we focus on the women, what\u2019s happening there seems to be heading towards disaster. You know, the Iraqi women have been among the \u2014 in the lead of liberated Muslim women. Actually, they\u2019re not Muslim. And I guess one of the difficulties here is that, you know, I don\u2019t think of the Middle East as Muslim. It\u2019s been, for thousands of years, a mixture of religion. Iraq has been, you know, Christians are very important, Jews were very important. It\u2019s not there now. But so whatever culture \u2014 and what I call ethical Islam is actually an ethical mixed heritage. It\u2019s about how people of different religions have lived together for millennia, and that\u2019s what I cherish. And that has been destroyed. I hope not irretrievably. I don\u2019t quite know how we\u2019re going to come back, but I think it\u2019s latently present. They did it for literally thousands of years, as old as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, so they\u2019ve been doing it for a good long time. So I\u2019m unable to say how does one restore ethical Islam to Iraq. Well, I think it\u2019s there living in the people, but I don\u2019t think that the average Iraqi woman is concerned more \u2014 at the moment what they want most is safety, peace, clean water, electricity. And let us give them that, if we can, and then allow them to figure out how to run their country. Well, let me ask you this. I think there might be, again, a kind of knee-jerk response that Americans might have that Islamic law, I mean, any religious law, but that Sharia law as part of the constitution, as part of the new system would automatically be bad for women. Is that true? Well, there are two ways of answering that. Sharia law is in itself a hugely complex, vast body of law, some of which is liberal, some of which is not. It depends how you put it together. So it\u2019s a huge volume of laws composed in the medieval era. Some of the judges were very enlightened and tried to give justice to women, and some did not. And out of that, one could piece together a law that treats women with justice. But I don\u2019t see that, at this moment, we are able to do that. Tunisia has done a version of that, but someone introducing Sharia law at this moment into Iraq, I think, is very likely to use the most conventional and the most biased-against-women version of it. And I think that, really, there the peril is. If we were to see somebody now insisting that we have to introduce into the American Constitution that everything has to agree with Christianity, then they\u2019re not out to bring in the most liberal interpretations. You\u2019ve talked about fundamentalism among Muslims, and everyone sees that. And also, you\u2019ve talked about things that are disturbing in our country. But I wonder, are there places you look for hope, and that help you maybe see the picture differently? Well, really, you know, as we\u2019ve been talking about, say, Iraq or how the veil is seen, I guess dominant in my own mind has been the politics of it. And the politics have not been pleasant. But through exactly this same time of being in America, I\u2019ve been astounded and moved and inspired by the kind of \u2014 on the ground people have been quite open. You know, we\u2019ve been talking about prejudice against Islam in America, but actually what I\u2019ve encountered on a living basis as I have observed non-Muslim Americans interact with Muslims or as well as with myself, is their extraordinary openness and that they\u2019re not tied down by the kinds of things we\u2019ve been talking about, that they\u2019re not tied down by prejudices. So I do think we\u2019re actually living through quite a transformation in America, but it\u2019s not obvious on the surface. It\u2019s not what\u2019s happening on the politically explicit level. And it\u2019s not what makes the headlines and the news stories. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. But, in fact, on the ground it\u2019s really marvelous, actually. I mean, that\u2019s quite a strong word, really. It is. It is. Well, it is marvelous, what\u2019s going on. So that\u2019s where my hope lies. Leila Ahmed holds the Victor S. Thomas chair at the Harvard Divinity School. Her insights challenge us to question American cultures, instincts, and analyses about who Arabs and Muslims are if we really want to understand Islam as a force in women\u2019s lives and in our world. Leila Ahmed\u2019s books include Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate and a memoir, A Border Passage. Here in closing is a reading from that work. \u201CIt has not been only women and simple unlearned folk who have believed, like the women who raised me, that the ethical heart of Islam is also its core and essential message. Throughout Muslim history, philosophers, visionaries, mystics, and some of the civilization\u2019s greatest luminaries have held a similar belief. But throughout history, too, when they have announced their beliefs publicly, they have generally been hounded, persecuted, executed. \u2026From almost the earliest days, the Islam that has held sway and that has been supported and enforced by sheikhs, ayatollahs, rulers, states, and armies has been official textual Islam. \u201C\u2026There has never been a time when Muslims, in any significant number, have lived in a land in which freedom of thought and religion were accepted norms. Never, that is, until today. Now, in the wake of the migrations that came with the ending of the European empires, tens of thousands of Muslims are growing up in Europe and America, where they take for granted their right to think and believe whatever they wish and take for granted, most particularly, their right to speak and write openly of their thoughts, beliefs and unbeliefs. \u201CFor Muslims this is, quite simply, a historically unprecedented state of affairs. Whatever Islam will become in this new age, surely it will be something quite other than the religion that has been officially forced on us through all these centuries.\u201D From Leila Ahmed\u2019s memoir, A Border Passage.
