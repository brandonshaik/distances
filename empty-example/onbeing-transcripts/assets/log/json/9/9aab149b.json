  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. James Prosek, my guest this hour, has written that for him, \u201Cthe trout in its stream is the essence of life, encompassing survival and beauty, death and birth.\u201D Prosek is a 33-year-old fly-fisher, painter, and writer who has always, as he puts it, found God \u201Cthrough the theater of nature.\u201D We explore the sense of meaning and mystery he\u2019s developed along the way, including his concern with how we humans limit our sense of other creatures by the names we give them. Nature really is chaotic. The real myth is the one that the Natural History Museum promotes in its collections and in its family trees and genealogies. The real myth is the myth of order. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Kate Moos, managing producer of Speaking of Faith. This week, we bring you Krista\u2019s 2008 conversation with painter and writer James Prosek on his philosophy of mystery, nature, and fishing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. James Prosek, is a 33-year-old fly-fisher, artist, and writer who has always, as he puts it, found God \u201Cthrough the theater of nature.\u201D From a young age, he\u2019s been fascinated by trout, and now eels, which he sees as mystical creatures, and he\u2019s captured them literally and artistically by way of both angling and paint. We explore the sense of meaning and ritual James Prosek has developed along the way, including his concern with how we humans limit our sense of other creatures by the names we give them. We\u2019ll also hear the words of Henry David Thoreau, Bruce Chatwin, and Izaak Walton. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CFishing with Mystery.\u201D James Prosek published his first book, Trout, an Illustrated History, when he was 19 years old and a student at Yale University. The book is a historical and spiritual reflection on trout, accompanied by more than 70 of Prosek\u2019s watercolor paintings of the trout of North America. These days, his artwork is exhibited widely and is featured in a line of Patagonia T-shirts that benefit conservation of the global freshwater habitats of trout. And Prosek has now published eight books, ranging from a novel for young adults about his parents\u2019 divorce to The Complete Angler about two summers he spent in England tracing the legacy of a classic 17th-century book about fishing and philosophy. Through all of this education and adventure, James Prosek has stayed rooted in rural Connecticut. He fished and traveled around the world along the latitude of his hometown for his 2003 book, Fly-Fishing the 41st. He spoke with me by way of a studio near that same town where he now lives and paints two doors down from the house he grew up in. It was a stormy day, and it seemed somehow fitting that the sounds of nature joined our conversation. I ask everyone this question, and I get a sense from what I\u2019ve read of you that you didn\u2019t have a real \u2014 any kind of formal religious upbringing. But I wanted to ask you, you know, when I ask you what is the religious or spiritual background of your childhood? What is that noise? Well \u2026 Is it raining there? \u2026 oh, thunder. No. It\u2019s been \u2014 we\u2019ve had awful, well, not awful but really severe storms. Oh, my gosh. Yesterday, actually, was one of the more severe \u2026 I can hear it. \u2026 storms that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. There was the rain almost looked like it was falling up from the ground and there were hailstones and stuff. It was \u2026 Wow. \u2026 very dramatic. I\u2019ve never heard thunder come through the microphone like that. OK. Yeah. Well, that\u2019s good. : Anyway, well, I was not raised with any formal religion. My parents both were raised with some form of Christianity. There was a question when I was born whether or not I would be baptized. And my mom tells me the story that she brought me to the local priest with my father, and in her story, the priest is smoking cigarettes. I don\u2019t know what the significance of that is, but he said, \u201CI won\u2019t baptize him unless you guys come to regular services,\u201D so they kind of didn\u2019t and I was never baptized. So I guess I\u2019m technically nothing. But from a very early age, I\u2019ve considered the theater of nature to be my house of worship, and I\u2019ve never seen any problem with enjoying God\u2019s creation in his creation. I\u2019m also very much a Darwinian. My father sort of raised me that way. Mm-hmm. But it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t believe in God or Creation. It seems like your father was a really formative person in terms of this passion that you have for the natural world. I mean, that comes through in all your writing. So you also say he \u2014 talk about how he used a Portuguese word that means \u201Ccraziness\u201D to describe his seduction \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 by the natural world. And yours. Yeah. Well, loucura, I think, is maybe what you\u2019re talking about. Mm-hmm. Kind of a craziness. And his was for the sea and the stars. That was his kind of vehicle into nature. But also birds, actually, from an early age. He grew up in a suburb of S\u00C3\u00A3o Paolo, Brazil, and fell in love with nature as a child down there and all the colorful birds that flit around from tree to tree. And he and his brother even would set traps and catch them live in cages for a veranda. He\u2019s a very much self-educated person, and he had two very different sides. One was very pragmatic, wanted me to be an engineer, a doctor, and not a poor schoolteacher, which is what he ended up being. Right. But his other side was a very romantic side, reading poetry to me and talking about the stars and taking me out at night to look through the telescope at the sky, the night sky, and also teaching me the names of all the local birds. Oh, the birds. And you painted birds and drew birds when you were young, didn\u2019t you? I did, yeah. I started drawing birds when I was maybe four or five years old. And early influences were Audubon and Winslow Homer and people like that who had depicted nature the way they saw it in very stylistic and effective ways, in my mind. So it sounds like you might\u2019ve gone on and have been a lover of birds the way your father was, but then at the age of nine you were introduced to fishing. I mean, what was the story of that? How did that exactly happen? Well, yeah. I was kind of \u2014 birds had become my vehicle into nature from maybe five until nine years old, and in retrospect, I think the transition occurred around the time when my mother left home. She left when I was about nine years old, and I didn\u2019t see her for a couple of years. And I kind of, I guess, connected birds and the places that we walked in the woods together with her. I associated with her. So the transition\u2019s almost like a guillotine drop between, like, my love of birds and then I fell in love with fish, and for whatever reason, a particular fish called the trout. Right. Which I\u2019m sure everybody is familiar with. But they\u2019re very colorful, streamlined, beautiful creatures that live in some of the most pristine cold-water wildernesses that we have left in the world. And the trout were kind of the equivalent to my father\u2019s favorite bird, which was a warbler, which was kind of a secretive, colorful little bird that lives in the treetops and migrates from South America. Right. You say that the trout had a mystique. What is that mystique? Is it because, as you say, it lives in these pristine places? Or it\u2019s harder to find, harder to get to? Yeah. They\u2019re very difficult to see. I mean, most fish are because the surface of the water reflects our world back to ourselves, and unless you\u2019re wearing polarized glasses or something, it\u2019s hard to see through the waters. But one way to connect to those mystical creatures living beneath the surface is through angling. And by catching a fish with a hook, you\u2019re connected to it and its element through this little clear plastic line, which is almost invisible. But the trout, in particular, I always felt was a very mysterious mystical fish because they\u2019re especially spooky. If you walk up to a stream, a pool in a stream, and you\u2019re not very careful \u2014 if you don\u2019t crawl up to the bank \u2014 they\u2019ll immediately disappear and hide under the rocks. So it\u2019s a fish that you can only see if you really kind of know its habitat and spend a lot of time in their element. In the introduction to his first book about trout, James Prosek writes: \u201CThe instructive nature of the trout stream is not forced upon its visitors but held candidly by the water and the trees. The angler must make an effort to hear the stream\u2019s messages and see her beauty. I had learned superficially how to catch a trout, first with a worm and then by tying and casting flies. But my education really began once I\u2019d spent enough time near my local stream that I could begin to understand her language. Only after I\u2019d become comfortable with her modes of speech \u2014 winter silence, springtime growling roar, lazy summer trickling, and autumn calm \u2014 did I begin to understand that the stream was not only a place where I fished, but also a living, breathing celebration of hardship and joy. For me, the trout in its stream is the essence of life, encompassing survival and beauty, death and birth.\u201D James Prosek\u2019s paintings of trout are even more striking, perhaps, than his writings. He captures the individual nature and beauty of these secretive creatures much like James Audubon did with birds. On our Web site, speakingoffaith.org, view our SoundSeen slideshow of some of these watercolors and some of Prosek\u2019s most recent wildlife illustrations, which he says evoke \u201CGod\u2019s blueprints.\u201D The trout was pretty much my obsession from nine years old until about 28. Right. And then I kind of \u2014 I painted, did a book on the trout of North America, which had about 70 paintings. Yeah. I\u2019ve got that book. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then I did a book on the trout of Europe and Asia and North Africa. And then I kind of, through the depiction of the diversity of these fishes, I\u2019d kind of said what I needed to say for the time being. But that led me to an investigation in my own mind of why did I have this compulsion to go out and document all these trout \u2026 Right. \u2026 in watercolors? And why had people named all these fish after themselves and their friends and the places they\u2019d come from? So I \u2026 What did you come up with? Well, the answers are not necessarily there yet. But, I mean, currently I\u2019m working on a book about eels. And I think what attracted me to the eel is that it\u2019s a creature that inspires fear and awe and reverence in people, like the snake. For some reason, we have a reaction to this minimalist creature. And it\u2019s kind of bodiless and nameless. It doesn\u2019t really fit into any of the categories that we want it to fit into. Nature really is chaotic. The real myth is the one that the Natural History Museum promotes in its collections and in its family trees and genealogies is that \u2026 That it\u2019s ordered. Yeah, that it\u2019s ordered. I mean, if anything, what we call mythology that, like, an eel in Polynesia can take the form of a water guardian called the taniwha. To me, that\u2019s more reality than the myth of order because magic and what we don\u2019t know is so much greater than what we do know. But I don\u2019t want to be too hard on science because I am a very science-minded person. Mm-hmm. And I think I\u2019ve come to investigate these themes about naming and the categorizing of nature and the Linnaean system of classification where every creature in the world is distilled down to this binomial system, genus and species, like first and last names in humans. Of course, we need names to communicate, but I think sometimes names can get in the way of how we view the world and our observations of things. Which is, you know, something that philosophers have been grappling with for a long time. So this is what\u2019s been swirling around in my head like a big whirlpool. Well, I mean, I\u2019m intrigued by that because, you know, as we just said, you\u2019re not a traditionally or formally religious person, but there are religious ideas and themes and evocative ideas that echo all the way through your writing. And, you know, in fact, naming, the power of naming, has a big place \u2026 The control of things. \u2026 in the Bible and in other religious traditions as kind of a primitive power \u2026 Huge. \u2026 of giving something a name. Or that, you know, in Australia with the songlines, you know, naming things into being, singing things into being. Yeah, it\u2019s true. I took two separate trips to New Zealand and to other parts of Micronesia and Polynesia to try to get traditional stories from the people about eels. And it\u2019s hard for, I think, Western people to understand what these stories mean because they\u2019re so married to the places where they\u2019re told. Like, throughout a story, if you\u2019re lucky enough to hear one, they\u2019ll mention places throughout the stories, and the stories are almost like a map to the local people. As you learn the story, you learn the places where the different things happen in the stories. I was just in this island in Micronesia called Pohnpei in March, and there they have for every plant, for every fish, for every bird, they have a kind of common name that they use every day and then a magical name that\u2019s sometimes only known by the medicine people or the people of power, the high chiefs, that if you utter that name of that creature it kind of either calls them to action or produces some effect that the normal name doesn\u2019t. So that name kind of contains or evokes their essence. Yes. Author and painter James Prosek. In his book The Songlines, the late travel writer Bruce Chatwin wrote: \u201CThere is a labyrinth of invisible pathways which meander all over Australia and are known to Europeans as \u2018Dreaming-tracks\u2019 or \u2018songlines\u2019; to the Aboriginals as the \u2018Footprints of the Ancestors\u2019 or the \u2018Way of the Law.\u2019 Aboriginal creation myths tell of the legendary totemic beings who had wandered over the continent in the Dreamtime, singing out the name of everything that crossed their path \u2014 birds, animals, plants, rocks, waterholes \u2014 and so singing the world into existence. \u2026 In theory, at least, the whole of Australia could be read as a musical score. \u2026 One should perhaps visualize the Songlines as a spaghetti of Iliads and Odysseys, writhing this way and that, in which every \u2018episode\u2019 was readable in terms of geology.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from America Public Media. Today, \u201CFishing with Mystery,\u201D with artist and angler James Prosek. Prosek\u2019s best-known book, perhaps, is The Complete Angler, which also gave rise to a Peabody Award-winning documentary film. While trying to come up with a travel grant proposal as a student at Yale, he discovered the original Compleat Angler by the 17th-century amateur naturalist and philosopher Izaak Walton. Prosek was astonished to learn that there are more different editions of this book in print than any other in English, aside from the Bible and the works of Shakespeare. It\u2019s a book, he says, that everyone\u2019s heard of but nobody\u2019s read. Prosek got his travel grant and spent two summers in England tracing Walton\u2019s world in which fishing, British history, and Anglican theology were uniquely intertwined. There was a civil war going on in England, and his religion, Anglicanism, was being pushed out of London by Cromwell and the Puritans, I mean, to kind of simplify things. Yeah. And so Walton\u2019s book, The Compleat Angler, which is kind of a pastoral fantasy about a guy who goes out fishing from London and meets an otter hunter on the way to the stream, and they start having a discourse about their respective passions. The fisherman defends fishing, and the hunter defends hunting. And the fisherman ends up converting the hunter, almost a religious conversion. And The Compleat Angler is, in part, code for \u201Cthe complete Anglican\u201D and it was \u2026 Right. \u2026 almost like a civil war polemic. He was trying to very gently express his views about what was going on in the country during his time. And what he was advocating in my mind, Izaak Walton, was a return to primitive Christianity, because he talks about the apostles. One of his first arguments in favor of fishing is that the apostles were fishermen and that Jesus chose fishermen to show his miracles to. But, anyway, that\u2019s \u2026 Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s interesting, because there is this parallel that you demonstrate in what you wrote after that, that Walton is drawing this parallel between the qualities that make a good angler and that make a good Christian. Yeah. I mean, not just that symbolism, that fish and fishing run all the way through the New Testament. Yeah. And that they\u2019re gentle people who follow peace. Izaak Walton\u2019s fisherman, Piscator, says to the hunter Venator: \u201CAngling is an art and an art worth your learning. The question is, rather, whether you be capable of learning it? For angling is somewhat like poetry. Men are to be born so: I mean, with inclinations to it, though both may be heightened by discourse and practice, but he that hopes to be a good angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit, but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience and a love and propensity to the art itself. But having once got and practiced it, then doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that it will prove to be like virtue, a reward to itself.\u201D He was sort of advocating, you know, this, like I said, this return to primitive Christianity in which he meant, \u2018Look, guys. We don\u2019t need these chapels and churches and buildings to worship in.\u2019 Or to fight over, as they were doing in his day. Yeah, or to fight over. Yeah. We can worship in a cave, in a canyon, and by a stream. You can take Christianity, really, anywhere \u2014 in a prison, in a hospital, in a church, in the city, in the country \u2014 because it rests on the sacrifice of a human being. Whereas the indigenous faiths around the world, like in Polynesia, they\u2019re completely connected to creatures that live in the environment, and they\u2019re completely not portable. You can\u2019t take the Maori religion in New Zealand and superimpose it on the Inuits in Alaska. It doesn\u2019t work. Now, as you said, Walton\u2019s own exploration of angling was very much connected with his theology and with his ideas about God and religion. And, I mean, you also did a fair amount of theological reflection. I mean, it comes through in the book. I mean, the word, the very lofty word \u201Cimmortality\u201D is something that \u2014 is a word you use in the context of fishing and what you think about while fishing and learn through fishing. I mean, talk to me about that. Yeah. Well, I think at some point in my life, fishing was a way of achieving a timelessness, especially fishing in rivers because rivers have a very timeless quality. They\u2019re always flowing, flowing, flowing. They\u2019re flowing down to the sea. The clouds form, they float over the countryside, the rain falls, they fill up the ground, the springs, the whatever. The stream is kind of this immortal entity, at least in my mind. So as a fisherman fishing in a stream, oftentimes you\u2019re standing in the stream. You see a reflection in the stream and you kind of get swept up in this immortal cycle and kind of lose yourself. And there\u2019s different things that sort of stop thoughts and stop time and really, for me now, I mean, I do fish \u2014 I still fish, but it doesn\u2019t do the same thing it did for me when I was nine or 14 or a younger person. But creativity is really my faith. That\u2019s my way of stopping time and thought processes. And to get there, it takes really hard work for me, sitting in the studio sometimes not painting anything all day but just trying to get into that place where I can connect to what my mother calls the pipeline. Right. You know, and she always said to me that creativity was God\u2019s gift to us. He is the Creator. And my way of connecting with that spiritual force that I call God, and that many of us call God, is through either being in nature or being in my space that I\u2019ve made for myself making stuff, making stuff with my hands. Like painting. That just tactile quality of \u2014 yeah. Even just running a pencil across the paper. I mean, I write. I keep a journal very religiously, and it\u2019s not so much what I\u2019m writing in it but just the act of, like, kind of putting the pen or pencil on the paper. I don\u2019t know why that is so pleasing to me, but \u2014 I also have a compulsion to write \u2014 but making a mark on that paper is really important to me. One of James Prosek\u2019s heroes is the author Henry David Thoreau, who also combined contemplation of nature with a life of creativity. In his book Walden, Thoreau wrote: \u201CSometimes, after staying in a village parlor \u2019til the family had all retired, I have returned to the woods and, partly with a view to the next day\u2019s dinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight, communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes, which had their dwelling 40 feet below. It was very queer, especially in dark nights, when your thoughts had wondered to vast and cosmogonal themes and other spheres, to feel this faint jerk which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again. It seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air as well as downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus, I caught two fishes, as it were, with one hook.\u201D \u201CThe Angler\u2019s Song,\u201D a poem by fisherman-philosopher Izaak Walton, which was set to music by one of his contemporaries, the English composer Henry Lawes. James Prosek\u2019s film, The Complete Angler, further documents Izaak Walton\u2019s legacy through the streams and waterholes of England and Ireland. It\u2019s a poetic philosophy, a theology of fishing, which you can watch on our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. In one scene, Prosek invites you into Connemara, which you might remember from our program with the late Irish philosopher and poet John O\u2019Donohue. An Irishman who\u2019s angled for more than 60 years teaches Prosek the art of dapping, the earliest known form of fly-fishing.

After a short break, more conversation with James Prosek on the connection between the natural world and human friendship and how he is using his art to promote freshwater conservation. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faithcomes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CFishing with Mystery,\u201D with artist and angler James Prosek. He\u2019s the author of eight books of fiction and nonfiction. His paintings and drawings have been widely reprinted and shown. They were recently featured at a yearlong exhibit at the Aldridge Museum of Contemporary Art in Richfield, Connecticut. Prosek titled that exhibit \u201CLife and Death: a Visual Taxonomy.\u201D Pursuing his sense of the limitations of names, he assigned individualized symbols, curvilinear lines, to each creature he painted in the place of its Latin scientific nomenclature. He\u2019s currently at work on a new book on eels, for which he\u2019s traveled to New Zealand and the Pacific islands of Micronesia. In life and work, James Prosek is an interesting mixture of active and reflective, modern and traditional. You use these words when you talk about qualities of life, virtues. I don\u2019t know if you use the word \u201Cvirtues,\u201D but you talked about them in the context of Izaak Walton and also yourself, words like \u201Ccontent,\u201D being \u201Ccontent, simple, quiet.\u201D Mm-hmm. Those are kind of \u2014 they kind of have an old-fashioned ring to them. You know? Yeah. But they are virtues, and I would call them virtues, that you do seem to have cultivated and on many levels. Yeah. I mean, I tried to be contemplative and simple in the way that \u2014 Walton used the word \u201Csimple.\u201D I don\u2019t know what exactly he meant by it, but I think he meant just maybe not requiring a whole lot or appreciating what you have. Gratitude, too, is important. But I certainly don\u2019t judge people on the things that society seems to judge them on. And it may go back to naming too. I mean, people have business cards and their titles \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 on their business cards, and vice president of this and baloney of that. And somebody who, like my good friend Joe Haines, who caught me fishing illegally when I was a kid in a local reservoir and became kind of an outdoor mentor, he never finished high school. He never did the things that modern society may kind of think of as a successful person, but to me he\u2019s an infinitely beautiful creature. And I just admire what he\u2019s done with his life so much. I mean, you wrote a book about Joe Haines and your friendship with him and fishing, and I did want to ask you about that connection that you discerned and that you really have elaborated on between fishing and friendship. Yeah. What is that? What is that? I think it really goes back to some kind of predatory thing. Like we evolved to catch or grow our own food. We\u2019re foragers and we\u2019re hunters. And the predatory instinct is still very much inside of us, in my mind, anyway. So, I mean, that\u2019s why I feel like I like to fish. That\u2019s also why I think I like to draw, because I think drawing was a predatory impulse. The people drew these creatures on cave walls I think in part to learn more about them. When you draw something, you\u2019re forced to observe something very closely. But I don\u2019t necessarily put predatory and \u2026 With friendship? Predator and friendship together in the same \u2026 I\u2019m getting there. Yeah. OK. \u2018m getting there. But what I was going to say is that I think camaraderie is also a part of the predatory process. Being out in nature with other humans at night on the water. I think especially at night the senses are really heightened. Some of my greatest memories with Joe Haines is fishing off the beach in Fairfield, Connecticut, in the surf at night. Also I think, I mean, sharing is a big part of survival. Yeah. Joe Haines has always kind of said, you know, one hand washes the other. He\u2019s got this sort of Yankee thing about him that you sort of give a bucket of clams to somebody and they in return will give you something back. And it\u2019s when \u2026 The barter economy. Yeah. Yeah. The barter economy. And when you\u2019re in a hard place, those people will help you survive and they\u2019ll pick you up. And I think when we first met, I may have been in a hard place. My mom had left home. And so when he caught me fishing in this local reservoir, he kind of took me under his wing also, because he\u2019d lost something in his life. His son had just moved to Colorado, and I think that\u2019s partly why we connected so well. But, yeah. I mean, there\u2019s something about going out in nature with your buddy and fishing or hunting that I think is very fundamental and visceral, and it cements a friendship in a different way than other types of friendships. So, you know, something that\u2019s striking to me reading your book about Joe, Joe and Me: An Education in Fishing and Friendship, there\u2019s a pace to the story, to the book, to the writing, to the experiences. It\u2019s not this dramatic narrative arc \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 that we\u2019re used to in books \u2026 No. \u2026 or entertainment or just, you know, the way we even think about what a story is. Nothing big happens. Right. There\u2019s this kind of \u2014 there aren\u2019t great big highs. There aren\u2019t great big lows. And yet there\u2019s kind of this sanctified ordinary life. Yeah. I mean, in ordinary everyday life, if you\u2019re listening there are majorly extraordinary things that happen. And I think that\u2019s where magic comes from. But \u2026 Yeah. What do you mean when you say magic? What does that word mean for you? Well, spending time with these Maori people in New Zealand kind of changed my worldview a little bit. When I first arrived to do research on eels and Maori culture, I drove from Auckland down to Hamilton, the next big town south. And there was this construction project that was stalling traffic. Most of the blue-collar workers down there are Maori, and they had fled the site because one of the workers had pulled up this giant eel in the bucket of the bulldozer \u2014 because they were digging in a swamp. Basically, there was this swamp that the highway has gone around for a long time, and there\u2019ve been a lot of accidents because there\u2019s a tight curve in the road. But the Maori said don\u2019t straighten the highway. The government wanted to straighten the highway through the swamp. They said, \u2018No, don\u2019t do it. There\u2019s a taniwha. There\u2019s a water monster living in the stream.\u2019 They went ahead with the project anyway, and then one of the workers pulled up this giant eel in the river, and they said, \u2018That\u2019s the taniwha.\u2019 And they all ran away. And they couldn\u2019t get anybody to come back to the site. So it was weird to me that in this day, in contemporary life, that a water monster, what we would call a mythical creature, could stall traffic. Or stop construction. But down there, magic was part of ordinary life for the Maori still. But I think magic is there if you want it to be there. And just going out fishing sometimes you see things that are kind of magical. And if you\u2019re receptive and open, you see them. And if you\u2019re not, you don\u2019t. There\u2019s a line, I think it\u2019s from the introduction to your book about trout, your first book: \u201CThe instructive nature of the trout steam is not forced upon its visitors but held candidly by the water and the trees.\u201D Hmm. \u201CThe angler must make an effort to hear the stream\u2019s messages and see her beauty.\u201D Wow. At least I\u2019m a little bit consistent, right? Yeah. That\u2019s lovely. : I mean, in some ways I feel like I was more connected when I was the age when I wrote that, like 17 or 18, than I am now, because all this other stuff kind of barrels into your life. But it\u2019s true. I mean, if you\u2019re not listening, you\u2019re not going to hear it. I try to listen to what, I mean, to the spirit of the creator that\u2019s talking to you, that\u2019s feeding you ideas, that\u2019s comforting you or pummeling you or whatever. I mean, nature is what we live in. This is a recording James Prosek made of night sounds on the Micronesian island of Pohnpei. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CFishing with Mystery,\u201D with artist and angler James Prosek. As we talk about these spiritual implications or insights that you\u2019ve drawn from fishing, in particular, there\u2019s also something I think that human beings \u2014 we were just talking about his impulse that we have to name things, and I also think we have this impulse to ritual. Oh, yeah. And we recreate that. I mean, we\u2019ve kind of done away with rituals in Western culture, but we reinvent it. It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad. Yeah. But, you know, we continually, we make it again, because we need it. And there\u2019s real ritual to fishing. I mean, even just the children\u2019s book that you did. The tackle box. You know, where you have all the, yeah, the tackle box. All the pieces. I mean, there\u2019s something \u2014 I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s ever done much fishing, but there\u2019s something so thrilling about that. And I think it does speak to that. I mean, is that something you\u2019ve thought about? Yeah. I mean, as a kid in the winter, again, I\u2019m sort of an obsessive person, but I used to, like, take every one of my lures out of the box, wash them, dry them, and put them back in the box. And taking an inventory of my tackle was a significant ritual. And tying flies for the coming season was a ritual. I think, again, in the process of predation there were a lot of rituals. There was the investigation in our minds of what the hunt was going to be about. There was the drawing on the cave walls \u2014 if that was related at all to predation. It may not have been. But I think in my daily life, putting out my paints on the palette is a ritual for me, lining up the colors the way I like them. That\u2019s kind of my daily ritual. You have kind of been bringing together your love of fish, and trout in particular, and also your painting in this project you\u2019ve been doing with the founder of Patagonia. Oh, yeah. Yvon Chouinard. Yvon Chouinard. Yeah, Yvon. Yeah. So you were fishing with him in Yellowstone and you hatched this idea? Yeah. I mean, Yvon\u2019s \u2026 And there\u2019s that friendship connection again. Yeah, he\u2019s a real visionary. I mean, he started this 1 percent for the planet thing where big companies give away 1 percent of their profits to conservation. Mm-hmm. So, yeah, I was fishing with Yvon in Yellowstone Park. I\u2019ve been involved with this conservation group called the Yellowstone Park Foundation for about 10 years, and we were on a trip to help raise money for the park and stuff, bringing different people fishing and asking them for money. Right. So we were sitting by the fireplace one night in this beautiful ranch called Silvertip Ranch in Montana near the park, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been thinking for years about maybe using some of your art on T-shirts for conservation.\u2019 And we sort of talked about putting paintings of trout on T-shirts and raising money and giving the money away to grassroots organizations or even individuals who were doing great work to not only preserve trout but preserve cold-water resources. You know, preserving trout is not as maybe small-minded as it seems. It\u2019s really about preserving clean water. But, yeah, it\u2019s been, I mean, fairly successful. We\u2019ve raised about $250,000 in the last three years and given it away. And even through the money we\u2019ve given away, there have been organizations that have started like the Balkan Trout Restoration Group. So it\u2019s what\u2019s called World Trout is this initiative. Yeah. And you said that you\u2019re not starting a new project, but you are identifying groups or individuals who are protecting native fish, and you\u2019re supporting their efforts. Yeah. But if we have to start a new group, we will. OK. Or encourage people to start a new, you know, restoration group or organization. It\u2019s really, yeah, about encouraging people who are doing good work to keep doing it. And, I mean, really fundamentally what it\u2019s about is, for me, preserving diversity of fishes or whatever around the world is preserving the sources of our awe and inspiration. If everything really comes out of nature, I mean, even the most abstract expressionist painting, even a black canvas, is derived from our experiences in nature. If we lose the creatures that form the foundation of our spiritual systems, if we lose the creatures that inspire us to be spiritual at all, then we will be really lost people with no food for our imaginations, nothing. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about, is keeping our spiritual sustenance alive, I guess. So, I mean, your concern with sustainability is not just, as you said, that this is also about clean water, but it\u2019s about our spirits as well. It\u2019s really about\u2026 Food for the imagination. I like that. It\u2019s about the human imagination more than anything else, clean water, whatever. If the water\u2019s gone, we\u2019re gone. The Earth doesn\u2019t give a crap. It\u2019ll burp us up and that\u2019s it. You know, realistically. Mm-hmm. But in our short little lives that we think are so important, but really aren\u2019t, I think it\u2019s important from one generation to the next to preserve these things, because they\u2019ve been important to me. I only know from my experiences. OK. If we fragment nature to the point where birds don\u2019t make their migrations anymore and things don\u2019t move, you know, the Earth could stop spinning. In Pohnpei, this island I was in, in Micronesia, the people believe that if you take the eels out of the streams, the water will stop moving, because it\u2019s the movement of the eels that keeps the rivers flowing. And in a way I think, like, the Earth spins because things move. Nothing is static. Nothing can fit in a box. Everything\u2019s moving. Everything\u2019s migrating, even humans. So how old are you now? I\u2019m 33. OK. I mean, you\u2019ve done a lot \u2026 Really, I hope so. Thank you. \u2026 in 33 years. And, I mean, you\u2019re doing a lot all the time. I just, I wonder if you kind of look back, because you were writing really profound things, not just about fishing, but about contemplation and immortality and life and death, when you were 18, 19, 20, 21. I mean, what are you learning now at 33 that adds to that, that refines it? Well, this book I\u2019m writing about eels I\u2019ve been researching for eight years, and it\u2019s obviously not the only thing I\u2019ve been working on for eight years, but it\u2019s been a real struggle writing this book because I want it to make sense. And there\u2019s some really big, what I believe are big, themes in the book that I want to come across, like about indigenous faiths. And when I started the book, I was more interested in the life history of the fish, eight years ago, but I didn\u2019t even know that eels were important to Polynesians, or Micronesians. But now that\u2019s become the biggest part of the story. But the eel also has a mysterious life history. No human has ever witnessed an eel spawning. They reproduce in the middle of the ocean and spend their lives in fresh water. I mean, I\u2019m into mystery. I\u2019m into a fish that has kept its mystery from humans. I mean, how many creatures have done that in this day and age? The world is changing. When I did that book, The 41st Parallel, traveling around the latitude line of my home, things were really different 10 years ago. Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t even think I had an e-mail address 10 years ago. Right. And I think exploration has sort of died with the shrinking of the world. So what is there left to talk about? I mean, the meaning of life, I guess. But I have things I want to say. Whether or not I can say them even now \u2014 I try to say them. I will try to say them. Like Emerson said, \u2018Speak now in hard words what you think today and if you change your mind tomorrow, you know, say it in hard words again, even if it contradicts everything you said the day before.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be too sort of didactic about it. Maybe just painting what I see is enough of an expression of spirit and faith. James Prosek is a painter, writer, and environmental activist. His books include The Complete Angler. His new book is Bird, Butterfly, Eel. In our interview, I got a sense of Prosek\u2019s truly restless imagination. Our conversation meandered into all kinds of unexpected subjects.
