  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, Bill McKibben on \u201CThe Moral Math of Climate Change.\u201D He authored the first popular book on climate change in 1989 and is one of the most insightful figures of our time on ecology and life. We\u2019ll explore his perspective on knowledge we can trust as we orient our minds and lives to changing realities of the natural world. The negotiation that\u2019s underway, we think is between China and the U.S. and the EU. It\u2019s really not; the real negotiation underway is between human beings on the one hand and physics and chemistry on the other. We\u2019re going to have no choice but to adapt, whether it\u2019s gracefully or in violent and ugly fashion to that demand of basic bottom line of the planet. But I think that we retain the capacity to do it in elegant and graceful ways. This is On Being. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This hour, with Bill McKibben, we seek perspective, both factual and moral, on human responsibility in a changing natural world. McKibben wrote The End of Nature, the first book on climate change for a general readership, in 1989. \u201COnly in the disappearance of nature as we have known it,\u201D he warned, \u201Cmay we finally realize how essential it has been to human civilization.\u201D Yet it\u2019s hard to know how to orient our minds and our lives to a sweeping scenario like this and to the constantly accelerating data on global warning that comes at us daily. So we\u2019ll seek foundational knowledge we can trust that Bill McKibben has gathered in two decades of being ahead of this curve, and we\u2019ll explore the evolution of his moral imagination and his action from a focus on personal responsibility to a sense that what might save the planet would also renew the skill of neighborliness and the meaning of human community. From American Public Media this is On Being, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, Bill McKibben on \u201CThe Moral Math of Climate Change.\u201D Bill McKibben is one of the most insightful and esteemed figures of our time on matters of the environment. He\u2019s a scholar in residence at Middlebury College in Vermont and the founder of 350.org, a global climate campaign named after what scientists deem the safe level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 350 parts per million. Bill McKibben\u2019s books and essays of the past two decades have both shaped and mirrored the way our cultural perspective has developed as we\u2019ve come to see the human affect on the environment as part of the whole picture of life and lifestyle. From early writing on ecology, he moved to an interest in local economies, consumer culture, neighborliness, and family size. He\u2019s written that \u201Chow well we control our numbers, our appetites, and the efficiency with which we satisfy those appetites \u2026 are the battles for our time, as morally compulsory as the battles for civil rights or against totalitarianism.\u201D Bill McKibben grew up in Toronto and suburban Boston and went to Harvard. He edited the Harvard Crimson and then landed a coveted job at William Shawn\u2019s New Yorkermagazine. I wondered, as we began to speak, how he then came to move to the mountains and publish The End of Nature when he was still in his 20s. From this vantage point, writing The End of Nature seems to have crystallized a change in the entire direction of his life. Indeed, and like all changes it happened both quickly and slowly. I had been writing \u201CThe Talk of the Town\u201D for The New Yorker in my early 20s, so the most urban job you could imagine. Yeah. Exactly. At the same time, I wrote a long piece for The New Yorker about where everything in my apartment came from. And, you know, I traced back to the oil wells in the Amazon, because Con Ed was buying a lot of Brazilian oil because it was low in sulfur, and I was in uranium mines in the Grand Canyon seeing where they got the uranium for the Indian Point nuclear reactor, and on and on and on. And these were in the days where there were really long pieces in The New Yorker, and by the time I was done, I sort of found myself thinking in a new way about the physicalness of the world. How completely dependent even \u2014 or maybe even especially in Manhattan \u2014 one was on the actual operation of the physical world even though it\u2019s very easy in New York to convince yourself that you can, you know, just mint money and ideas out of your head, you know, without any help at all. Right. I\u2019d grown up in the suburbs, which are sort of a device for making sure that you never notice the natural world. And so when I quit The New Yorker \u2014 The New Yorker got bought and they fired Mr. Shawn who\u2019d been the editor for 40 years \u2014 and in what seemed at the time like high principle, I quit The New Yorker and I moved up to the Adirondacks because I had no money and it was cheap. The Adirondacks are the great wilderness of the American east. And I fell in love with that landscape in a really, really deep way and therefore, it was all the harder to read the sort of initial scientific papers about climate change which were coming out in the mid- to late \u201980s. It hit me like a ton of bricks. When you went there did you know that you were going to pursue some of these insights you\u2019d gained in that piece? No. I had no idea what I was going to do. But that\u2019s what came to you. Lick my wounds. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what was overpowering was the sense that this wilderness, this wildness that I was falling in love with, wasn\u2019t going to be so wild anymore. The tone of that book was less fear than sadness because the big changes weren\u2019t yet breaking over our heads the way they are now. Then it was mostly the anticipation 20 years ago of what it would feel like to live in a world that meant something different. Not just a world that didn\u2019t operate effectively or easily anymore, but one that spiritually, psychologically, philosophically meant something different and something less than the one that I\u2019d been born into. And this was \u2014 I suppose you were writing this in the mid- to late \u201980s, right? The book was published in 1989. It came out 20 years ago this fall. Yeah. That\u2019s right. And what I have learned \u2014 I think this is the first time that I\u2019d seen this fact from your writing is though in fact what we might call the beginnings of the science of climate change had been around for 30 years, right? I mean, it was 1957 that those scientists at the Scripts Institution \u2026 That\u2019s right. They put up the first instrument up on the slopes of Mauna Loa in Hawaii to measure CO2 in the atmosphere. Until then, what had happened was people had assumed that the oceans were just absorbing most of it, but no one had ever bothered to find out. And in 1956, an oceanographer actually did the calculations and determined that, indeed, the oceans were already at saturation for CO2. It must be accumulating in the atmosphere. The next year, they put up that instrument and sure enough, it began to show quite quickly that the CO2 level was rising steadily in the atmosphere. And they spoke of what they described as a large-scale geophysical experiment, the likes of which had never been seen and they suggested also the likes of which might not be repeatable because it might have catastrophic consequences, right? We\u2019re living in that experiment now and it is the biggest experiment ever and the problem is that we live inside the test tube. Right. Right. You know, we can\u2019t sort of wash it out and start over again. We also have trouble seeing from inside the test tube, right? We can\u2019t. Absolutely. We can\u2019t. So, you know, and here\u2019s something \u2014 here\u2019s an image that you gave me, a visual image. You wrote, \u201CIn 1968, when I was a boy, Apollo 8 sent back the first pictures of our planet, that blue-white marble floating in space. Well, those pictures are as out of date as my high school yearbook photo. The planet doesn\u2019t look like that or behave like that anymore \u2014 there\u2019s more blue and less white, more cyclones swirling in the tropics. It\u2019s a different Earth; we might as well hold a contest to pick a new name.\u201D I think that\u2019s a very helpful image because all of us who are adults now who\u2019ve grown up, as you say, inside the test tube with varying degrees of awareness, we\u2019ve all seen that picture but I don\u2019t think people have pointed out to us that that\u2019s not even any kind \u2014 that\u2019s not the picture we would see now. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a planet like the one on which we lived, on which we were born, but different now \u2014 different in profound ways. We\u2019re seeing substantially more rainfall with each passing decade because warm air holds more water vapor than cold. We\u2019re seeing, conversely, much more drought because as that water evaporates up into the atmosphere, it\u2019s parching places. We have less ice not only in the Arctic but probably even more importantly the great glaciers of the Andes and the Himalayas are melting with enormous speed. I was in Benares, Varanasi, a couple of months ago. You know, that\u2019s the most timeless scene in the world. Hindu pilgrims have been arriving for thousands of years every day by the score to bathe in the waters of the Ganges. The glacier at the head of the Ganges we think now is going to be melted out by 2035. That timeless scene is going to go, and 400 million people who depend on that river are going to have to figure out some other way to water their lives. Bill McKibben is describing a changing reality of the natural world on which there is broad, if nuanced, consensus within the scientific community. Only in a few nations, notably the U.S., Great Britain, and Australia, is there politicized debate about whether climate change is actually happening. Though there is a passionate spectrum of viewpoints on its scope and on what to do about it, which is the focus in parts of the world that are feeling its most immediate effects. This became personal for Bill McKibben in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2007 when he caught dengue fever, one of several mosquito-borne diseases that are spreading to new areas of the world, in part as a result of rising temperatures. There\u2019s an inverse, almost linear relationship between how much of the problem you caused and how quickly you\u2019re feeling the effects. I can remember going to the hospital in Dhaka and looking at this huge ward full of beds, a couple of hundreds beds, and people in every one of them just shivering away. And I remember thinking, \u201CGod, is this unfair. These people have done literally nothing to cause this. When the UN tries to measure how much carbon each nation emits, you can\u2019t even really get a number for the 140 million people in Bangladesh. It\u2019s just like a rounding error in the whole calculation. You know, the 4 percent of us in this country produce 25 percent of the world\u2019s CO2. It\u2019s not perfect epidemiology, but the moral math works for me. If there\u2019s a hundred beds in that hospital, 25 of them are on us. Mm-hmm. And, you know, we\u2019ve often talked in recent years, decades, about something called \u201Ccompassion fatigue.\u201D I also think this is related but it\u2019s different. I think there is such a thing as outrage fatigue. Right? Because statistics like that and numbers like that, scenarios like that, are as prone to make people throw up their hands and say, well, then, you know, I can\u2019t do anything anyway. So here\u2019s your chance to say what you would like people to really know, the basic foundation. Sure. What can you get people to really hang onto and then build their imagination and their action from that? Absolutely. Look, let\u2019s do the 90-second course in climate science. Human civilization has been around for 10,000 years. That\u2019s the period that scientists call the Holocene. The temperature has been very stable and the climate\u2019s very stable over that 10,000 years because the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere varied hardly at all. It was about 275 parts per million, give or take 10 parts per million. Stayed steady. Temperatures stayed steady. Civilization flourished. Two hundred years ago, we learned to burn coal, gas, and oil. We start on the, in retrospect, quite radical project of digging up hundreds of millions of years\u2019 worth of biology, combusting it, and putting all that carbon into the atmosphere in one big flush. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere begins to go up. At a certain point, we realize it\u2019s going to be a problem but we never know where the drop-dead line is. In fact, we really don\u2019t learn the answer to that question definitively until the summer of 2007. That\u2019s the summer that arctic ice begins to melt so incredibly rapidly. It\u2019s when we really look around and see things like how fast glaciers are going. It\u2019s the moment at which scientists that I\u2019ve known for a quarter century who\u2019ve always been worried and concerned suddenly are calling me in panic in the middle of the night, just saying this thing is out of control. January of \u201908, compiling all that real-time data and combining it with the ever more sophisticated paleoclimate, historical climate data that we get from ice cores and things, our leading scientists begin producing a series of papers that converge on this number 350 parts per million. Here\u2019s the bottom line in the abstract of one paper from a NASA team. And check out this scientific \u2014 it\u2019s pretty tough language for scientists. OK. They said, \u201CAbove 350 parts per million, you can\u2019t have a planet similar to the one on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted.\u201D OK? OK. Everything we know about civilization and whether you date it from Eden or the Buddha or Shakespeare or however you define it, that\u2019s all 275 parts per million CO2. We\u2019re at 390 parts per million right now. Right. We\u2019re beyond 350. We\u2019re beyond. We\u2019re beyond. We\u2019re not like the guy who went to the doctor and the doctor said, \u201CSome day, you keep eating like this, your cholesterol will be too high.\u201D Right. We\u2019re the guy who went to the doctor and the doctor said, \u201CLook, I\u2019m really surprised you\u2019re not having a heart attack already. You\u2019re in the zone where people do. You better try to bring it down fast and hope you get it there before the heart attack.\u201D And we\u2019re having the heart attack. When the Arctic melts, that\u2019s not a good sign. You know, we\u2019re beginning to see truly planet-scale effects of what we\u2019ve done. And so we\u2019ve got to rein it in. The good news and the bad news is we know what we have to do to do that. We have to stop burning coal and gas and oil. It\u2019s not complicated. It\u2019s hard, though, because coal and gas and oil are the center of our economy and the center of modernity and, hence, moving away from them very quickly will require effort of a different scale than we\u2019ve ever had to apply to anything before. The only even close analogy is the kind of industrial transformation at the beginning of World War II that we underwent, but this for much longer and on an even larger scale. If you found that Bill McKibben\u2019s four-minute history of climate change as helpful as I did, go to speakingoffaith.org and save the MP3 to your desktop or iPod to listen again or to send to friends and family. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from American Public Media, today exploring the perspective Bill McKibben offers on \u201CThe Moral Math of Climate Change.\u201D That bout with dengue fever, as McKibben tells it, was a tipping point that led him to move beyond writing and speaking out and into action and advocacy. He\u2019s currently focused his energy on 350.org, an international campaign that he founded with a mission to build a movement that can, quote, \u201Cunite the world around solutions to the climate crisis, the solutions that science and justice demand.\u201D On October 24, 2009, 350.org called a Planetary Day of Environmental Action and charted over 5,200 events in 181 countries.  Let me just tell you a few stories about this work we\u2019ve been doing. So we started this thing called 350.org, right, with six, six \u2014 seven recent graduates of Middlebury College where I\u2019m connected here. And we decided to see if we could build a global movement. Each one of those kids took a continent, OK, and set out to organize it. OK. And they went out and found people like themselves, mostly young people or in many cases people of faith, very concerned and willing to go to work. And in the course of 18 months, they built this \u2014 we built this network of people who wanted to take action. And it wasn\u2019t the usual suspects. People sometimes say, \u201COh, the environmental movement is rich white people.\u201D When we had our big global day of action on October 24th, there were 181 countries where it happened, 5,200 events, and some of the biggest were in the most unlikely places. Let me tell you a story about moral imagination. OK. We organized a camp in Africa for young people to sort of learn to be climate organizers. Many of these kids had never left their country before. Most of them had never been on an airplane. But they came. They went back home and did amazing work. So we didn\u2019t hear from the two sisters, 19 and 20, who had come from Ethiopia. We didn\u2019t hear from them for a couple of months because the Internet connection is no good in Ethiopia. It\u2019s hard. But we got a call about three weeks before our big day saying, \u201CIt\u2019s going great. Every high school in Addis Ababa now is studying global warming this fall because we\u2019ve got this, we built this curriculum for them. And they\u2019re all learning about 350 and it\u2019s going great. We\u2019re going to have a big event.\u201D Then we didn\u2019t hear for another two weeks. The day before our big global day of action, we got a sort of panicked, giddy call from them saying, \u201CLook, we\u2019ve got 15,000 people in the streets in Addis Ababa.\u201D And we got, you know, huge pictures from 300 rallies across India and 300 across China from mosques all over the Middle East. One of the ones that really made me almost weep was along the shores of the rapidly dwindling Dead Sea. The Israelis made a giant human three. The Palestinians on their beach, an enormous human five. The Jordanians along their seashore a big zero. We got a plane up and got pictures of all three of them, making the point that we\u2019re going to have to work across borders of all kinds to try to make this sort of change happen. And you\u2019ve written about cities where people are, as you say, living more lightly on the earth, where people have communally created different models. Yes. I spent a lot of time for a book that I wrote called Hope, Human and Wild. And so one was this city in Brazil called Curitiba. Right. I don\u2019t think there was anybody particularly environmental there. They were mostly concerned with making life decent for poor people, average people. The mayor, who is an architect, took a lawn chair and put it down at the nearest bus stop to City Hall, and he sat there for a day trying to figure out why buses were slow. And what he figured out was that it was that moment that, you know, the 20 seconds it took to walk up the stairs, put your quarter in the box, and go sit down. He sketched and quickly had built this series of what they called tube stations, these elevated platforms across the city. You\u2019d put your coin in and walk up the steps and wait for the bus and when it came the doors opened like the doors on a subway and you could get 20 people a second on and off. So it was that mix of technological insight but more importantly, social insight. Right. We\u2019re going to make the public more important than the private, that really worked. And what do you know? The result was that people really came to love living in that place. When he left office when he was term-limited out of office, he had a 94 percent approval rating. People would send delegations from other Brazilian cities saying, \u201CWill you move to our city and run for mayor there?\u201D You know, the story you just told reminds me of something we\u2019ve come across as I\u2019ve tried to talk to people about issues around environment and ecology. We did a program. We interviewed Majora Carter, who I\u2019m sure you know \u2026 Mm-hmm. Absolutely. \u2026 has revitalized, created Sustainable South Bronx. And also Cal DeWitt, who I know you know \u2026 Yes. \u2026 because I\u2019ve read you writing about him, who has been creating a sustainable environment and community in Wisconsin. Wetlands. In the wetlands. Right. In Wisconsin. Mm-hmm. So two very different places. We ended up calling that program \u201CDiscovering Where We Live\u201D because it wasn\u2019t an abstract notion of environmentalism that changed these communities. It was in that kind of holistic approach to life and to shared life that then environmentalism becomes this lynch pin. Here\u2019s a statistic that I really like, OK? Mm-hmm. One of the things that everybody, all environmentalists and things have been happy about in the last couple of years is this explosion of interest in local food. Right? Right. Because, you know, and just for no other reason, it takes a lot less energy to move a tomato five miles than 5,000 miles. And not coincidentally, it tastes better. I mean, I traveled 2,000 miles yesterday. I know how I feel. That\u2019s also how the tomato feels. Right. Exactly. But the real reason that\u2019s so interesting that we like farmers\u2019 markets, I think, turns out to be they\u2019re different. Parasociologists followed shoppers first through the supermarket, then through the farmers\u2019 market. Everybody\u2019s been to the supermarket. You know how it works. You walk in, you fall into a light fluorescent trance. You visit the stations of the cross around the perimeter of the supermarket. You emerge with your items. That\u2019s it. When they followed people around the farmers\u2019 market, they were having, on average, 10 times as many conversations per visit. OK? Cheap fossil fuel, you know, heated the planet. It made us rich. But it also, maybe most profoundly, made us the first kind of our species who\u2019ve had no practical need of our neighbors for anything. We tell ourselves, you know, what a great chic thing we\u2019ve invented, the farmers\u2019 market. Right. In fact, that\u2019s how all human beings shopped for food until 50 years ago and 80 percent of the planet still does. Still does, yeah. No wonder it feels good. I mean, this is what we\u2019re built for.

After a short break, Bill McKibben on Job and climate change. Also, more on his correlation between strengthening human community and healing the environment. In the end, it\u2019s strong communities that are efficient, that replace consumptive pleasure with deep human pleasure, that allow us to imagine a future that actually works. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. On Being comes to you from American Public Media. Ms. Tippett: Welcome back to On Being, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, today with Bill McKibben on \u201CThe Moral Math of Climate Change.\u201D Bill McKibben has been ahead of our cultural learning curve on the environment since he left The New Yorker magazine for the Adirondacks and wrote The End of Nature in 1989. He\u2019s since written widely about the holistic challenges of human responsibility in a changing natural world, from population to planning to community. And he\u2019s founded 350.org, an international climate campaign that seeks solutions as he puts it, \u201Cthat both science and justice demand.\u201D I\u2019ve followed Bill McKibben as an environmental expert for decades, but I was intrigued, as I began to read the sweep of his work preparing for this interview, by how overtly theological his reflection has also always been. There was robust participation of religious people and organizations in the October 2009 Planetary Day of Action organized by 350.org from students at Billy Graham\u2019s alma mater to women in hijab in Yemen. Bill McKibben notes with pleasure that the Torah portion for that day happened to be from the story of Noah. He describes himself as a reasonably orthodox practicing Methodist, and he likes to tell of a pivotal moment in his own thinking when he read Stephen Mitchell\u2019s translation of the biblical book of Job and found a whole new way to think about God, humanity, and the natural world. Well, Job is, you know, of all the books of \u2014 certainly of the Hebrew Bible, for me by far the most powerful and interesting. Everybody knows the story. Job finds himself cursed by God. He\u2019s lying in a dung heap at the edge of town, covered with oozing sores. His flocks are dead. His family\u2019s dead. You know, he\u2019s in a world of hurt. And his friends arrive to help him work through this, and he keeps lamenting what\u2019s going on and calling it unjust. And his friends keep saying, \u201COh, no, no. You know, you sinned or one of your children sinned. This is how it works and that\u2019s why you\u2019re being punished.\u201D And Job, much to his credit, is not the patient Job of legend. He keeps demanding that God appear and explain why this thing has happened to him. And God finally does. And I think the soliloquy that God delivers in the last three chapters of Job I think is the longest sustained speech that God gives anywhere in the Bible \u2026 That\u2019s probably true. Yeah. \u2026 Old Testament or New. And it\u2019s a remarkably interesting speech because it doesn\u2019t answer any of the questions that Job has set out. Instead, God gives this incredibly beautiful biologically accurate, crunchy, sexy tour of the physical universe. All the kind of interesting animals and, you know, and in very wild terms. You know, he asked Job, \u201CDo you hunt prey for the lion and her cubs? Do you help the vulture find \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 carrion on which to feast?\u201D \u201CIf you\u2019re so smart, you tell me, where do I keep the wind? Can you tell the proud waves here you shall break and no further? Do you know where the storms are, the warehouse for the storms?\u201D Well, you know, after listening to this for two or three chapters, Job basically says, \u201CSorry I asked.\u201D And sits down. Right. It is all about the majesty of nature. All the analogies there are about the natural world. The message seems to be, \u201CJob, you\u2019re not the center of things.\u201D The sort of \u201Cyour questions about justice and things are kind of puny. You\u2019re a small part of something very large and beautiful and that should be enough,\u201D and for Job it appears to be enough. So the shocking part in reading it now is realizing that for the first time in human history we\u2019re no longer in the position Job\u2019s in. So now we just spit right back at God. You know, \u201CCan you tell the proud waves where to break?\u201D \u201CHell, yes. We think we\u2019re going to raise the level of the ocean a couple of meters in the course of this century.\u201D \u201CDo you know where the storms are kept?\u201D \u201CYeah. We\u2019re pushing cyclones one after another across the Pacific. You know, we\u2019ve got our thumb on the scale.\u201D In a very short order we got very, very big. Human beings have always been in Job\u2019s position \u2014 small \u2014 and our job is to figure out how to get smaller again. And I think it\u2019s essentially a theological task, at least as much as anything else. But it occurs to me that we do \u2014 we do right now have some power. We are right now powerfully affecting the natural world. And so there would be a theological question about what that says about God. Hey, I think there\u2019s even that. I mean, what did Oppenheimer, you know, watched the first explosion at Alamogordo and quoted from the Gita, \u201CWe are become as Gods, destroyers of worlds.\u201D That\u2019s where we are right now. That\u2019s where we are right now, but isn\u2019t the point of this, I mean, ultimately we render \u2014 through this power, we seem to be set to render, as you said, civilization impossible. And maybe polar bears will never come back, for example. But isn\u2019t a possible outcome of this that nature wins? Perhaps. Look, two billion years from now or something the sun explodes and if you back up and take it long enough view of it, doesn\u2019t none of it make any difference anyway. Right? Mm-hmm. I find it hard to back up that far. I lack the necessary whatever it is. OK. You know, we\u2019re children of the late Pleistocene. We\u2019re born with this suite of flora and fauna around us. It seems to me a good life\u2019s work to try to keep some of it intact, especially since in the course of bringing it down many other theological and moral problems become involved. The billions of people who did nothing to cause this problem who are going to suffer grievously and already are, the huge suite of the rest of the world\u2019s DNA that we\u2019re taking down with us. Anybody who has any sense that the Earth might be in some way a museum of divine intent, you know, we\u2019re just willy-nilly running through the halls slashing at the paintings, you know? Mm-hmm. So there\u2019s all kinds of deep problems raised. And there\u2019s, you know, the sort of answers that people sometimes give are in another sense theological. I mean, there are people who say, \u201CWell, then, our response to this should be to become even more powerful and better gods at doing it. Let\u2019s figure out to manage everything. Put a big dome over the planet,\u201D whatever. Mm-hmm. I mean, I think that physically it\u2019s not possible to do that and I also think at some level there\u2019s something silly and ignoble and almost blasphemous about trying it. I think that the response we need is to figure out how to restrain ourselves, how to pull ourselves in. It strikes me that religious thinking back at least as far as the Buddha and probably farther, has centered mostly on the idea that we become most fully human when we don\u2019t put ourselves at the center of everything. I asked you a little while ago to talk about some really basic information that people could use to begin to wrap their minds around this and I want to ask you a similar question. Again, there\u2019s lots of conflicting information about what one can do that is helpful. Right? You know, one year it\u2019s drive a hybrid and the next year it\u2019s not. One year it\u2019s we can create alternative sources for fossil fuel and then the next year that\u2019s just as bad for the universe. Recycling is good; recycling doesn\u2019t matter. So where would you want to propose a different way to start thinking about what one can do? Sure. No, I mean, look, burning fossil fuel is the root of this problem, and so ways that we can figure out to use less of it are the answer. And what\u2019s interesting is that burning more and more fossil fuel is almost always or often because we\u2019re becoming more and more and more privatized. So many of the answers are about doing things together. So, yes, it\u2019s a good idea to drive a hybrid compared to driving an SUV. It\u2019s a much better idea to get on the bus compared with driving a hybrid. It\u2019s a much better idea even than that to do what Europeans have done, which is get together with their neighbors and demand that their politicians build a great train network so that they can, without even having to think about it, be innate environmentalists all the time. You know, that\u2019s sort of the \u2014 and you can do that same kind of scale of things in regard to food or almost anything else. OK. Give me another example. Let\u2019s think about another commodity that we all use every day: food, three times a day. OK? The moment the average bite of food that reaches an American\u2019s lips has traveled 2,000 miles to get there. That essentially means that it\u2019s been marinated in crude oil before you get it. So start thinking about how to change that. A, maybe you start cooking more and better yet, cooking for a bunch of people at one time, which means you have your neighbors over or you figure out how to share cooking and have the pleasure of \u2014 I\u2019m a Methodist so potlucks are, you know, deep in my DNA. Right. All right. You start eating lower on the food chain because it\u2019s clear that eating lots of red meat is a big problem in terms of the emissions it causes. You start searching out your neighbors to buy food from them. Find the farmers who live near you. Now maybe it costs a little bit more. Maybe not, because you\u2019ve knocked out a bunch of middlemen, but maybe it costs a tiny bit more. This is advice for people who still have some margin left. It doesn\u2019t work for the poorest people in our society who have to figure out how to scrape by. And it\u2019s one of the reasons that the great gulf between rich and poor the world around is now not just a sin, it\u2019s an enormous practical inconvenience to getting anything done. But it does allow all of us who still have some set of choices and margin to make those choices, not just in the direction of what seems environmentally obvious, but in the direction of what builds strong communities. Because in the end it\u2019s strong communities that are efficient, that replace consumptive pleasure with deep human pleasure, that allow us to imagine a future that actually works. In a 2008 essay for Orion Magazine, Bill McKibben wrote this: \u201CResearch has shown that when we live on car-filled streets, our number of close friends drops by half. We eat half the meals we used to with friends, family, neighbors. Forget about the flax-swingler; our clothes come through the ether from the mysterious geography of Lands\u2019 End. We don\u2019t need each other anymore, and that\u2019s the saddest thing we\u2019ve done \u2014 sadder even than the scourge of climate change, which at least is anonymous and impersonal.\u201D He concludes: \u201CThe big question for this century may turn out to be how fast we can relearn the skill of neighborliness.\u201D Read this entire essay, \u201CWhere Have all the Joiners Gone?\u201D \u2014 and subtitled \u201CA Declaration of Dependence\u201D \u2014 at speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, Bill McKibben on the \u201CMoral Math of Climate Change.\u201D We were both born in 1960. You know, I wonder if this era in which people like us maybe went thousands of miles away to college or sent their children thousands of miles away to college, you know, as a rite of passage backpacked through Europe or Latin America, that we didn\u2019t think twice about getting on an airplane to go on a business trip, right? Or to see friends. Will this way of living, you know, with this kind of \u2014 is that going to go away? Like, a hundred years from now will people look at some of this and just not believe that we lived this way? They may. I mean, I think we\u2019re going to have to learn to do a lot more travel via Google than American Airlines, you know? We\u2019re going to have to learn to stretch our minds in different ways and learn to really fall in love with our local places. But I think that the best parts about the world that we\u2019ve built are things that we can preserve. We\u2019re going to have to have different ways of doing them. You know, the best part of travel is the kind you described \u2014 the backpack across Europe, not the visit to Club Meds \u2014 you can just re-create your everyday life in a warmer spot, you know? Right. But even if you can\u2019t backpack across Europe, you can now have a relationship with someone in Europe in many ways more deeply and profoundly than it was easy, anyway, for someone a couple of generations ago because you can be in daily contact with them, hourly contact with them if you want. Right. Skype is a very interesting, different way of being in touch with people and staying at home. I don\u2019t know how the world exactly is going to change. I know that the main features of the world we inhabit are the result of our access to cheap fossil fuel. That\u2019s why our cities sprawl. That\u2019s why we drive everywhere by ourselves, on and on and on. I know that that has to change, that physics \u2014 I mean, the negotiations that are underway internationally and whatever, we think is between China and the U.S. and the EU. It\u2019s really not. The real negotiation underway is between human beings on the one hand and physics and chemistry on the other. That\u2019s a really tough negotiation because physics and chemistry are notoriously poor bargainers. They state their bottom line and that\u2019s it. Right. We\u2019re going to have no choice one way or another but to adapt, whether it\u2019s gracefully or in a violent and ugly fashion, to adapt to that demand of basic bottom line of the planet. But I think that we retain the capacity to do it in elegant and graceful ways. That\u2019s the hope, anyway. But it really requires us to do it fast and with real commitment. Elegantly but quickly. That\u2019s it. So, you know, you\u2019ve written about the sadness that descended on you as you wrote The End of Nature. And I wonder, you know so much about what\u2019s at stake here and you have all these facts at your fingertips. I mean, did they \u2014 did they haunt you? I think the advantage of having written about this 20 years ago is that I\u2019ve had two decades to work my way through \u2026 OK. \u2026 whatever those cycles of grief and whatever, you know, all the denial and bargaining and acceptance and yada yada that you supposedly go through. I\u2019m like on cycle 11 or whatever. OK. You know, I\u2019ve had a lot of time. So, yes. You know, part of me is still completely haunted and sad and part of me never takes a moment for granted. I love to ski in the winter, cross country ski above all else, and there\u2019s not a day when I\u2019m out skiing in the woods when I\u2019m not thinking this is a gift and not something to be taken for granted, because it\u2019s not going to be here all that much longer, probably. Mm-hmm. On the other hand, I\u2019ve gotten through enough of that, that I can take enormous joy in the prospect of people coming together to do something about it. Right. I waited 20 years to see what the global warming movement would look like when it finally emerged, and it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s diverse. It\u2019s on both sides of the divide between rich and poor. It\u2019s from every faith around the world. It\u2019s young predominantly but not completely. It\u2019s really, really wonderful and that gives me an enormous charge of deep joy. And you have a teenage daughter; is that right? I do. I have a 16-year-old. So what is the effect on her of living with you, and how does living with her make you think differently about how this will all go? Well, of course it raises the stakes in some other way emotionally in powerful ways and probably I don\u2019t even think about them that often \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 because it\u2019s too intense and too hard. For her, you know, I mean, well, she\u2019s a good Harry Potter fan and there were several years when she referred to me as the Dark Lord because I was so \u2026 Full of doom and gloom? \u2026 assiduous about turning out the lights. Oh, OK. Because I turned out the lights all the time. Right. Right. But she\u2019s turned into a great activist. She went with me to India this past summer. We work together and that\u2019s good fun. And most of the people I work with are all, you know, between 16 and 25. Well, that\u2019s really \u2014 this is my last question but, you know, I say in my engagement with younger people \u2014 I also have a 16-year-old daughter \u2014 but also people I\u2019m in conversation with, people I work with, I am very excited. I feel like they have a sensibility. They\u2019ve grown up with the Internet. They have a completely different imagination. Absolutely. I mean, technologically and morally somehow. Globalization isn\u2019t an abstract concept. You know, it\u2019s something they know in their being. Do you also \u2026 So with seven Middlebury College students and essentially almost no money, we organized the biggest day of political action in the planet\u2019s history. And it\u2019s because they have a visceral, intuitive sense of how to use technology, how people are connected. They didn\u2019t just send e-petitions to each other. Yeah. They used it to organize people on the ground in real life to do things. But they live in a different mental space and, in many ways, much more promising one that goes way beyond national boundaries and at the same time has room for deep ? it\u2019s both deep and local and wide and global at the same time. And let\u2019s hope that it\u2019s come in time. Let\u2019s hope we got some of this going in time. It\u2019ll be an interesting race to see where it comes out, and we will find out. I mean, it\u2019s not going to be a hundred years in the future before we figure out whether we dealt with global warming or not. We\u2019ll know in the next few years whether we started to take steps on the scale necessary. It\u2019s an exciting, scary, intense moment. It\u2019s for our time. You know, we grew up looking backwards at, say, the Civil Rights Movement or something \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 and admiring the people who had the courage and conviction to go put everything on the line and do it then. For our time, this requires the same moral urgency, the same kind of sacrifice, the same kind of theological rethinking, the same kind of practical change. It\u2019s that kind of moment on steroids because it\u2019s about the whole planet. Bill McKibben is a scholar in residence in environmental studies at Middlebury College and the founder of 350.org. His books include The End of Nature and Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future. In writing the script for this program, we faced some hurdles in understanding, explaining, and simply fact-checking the particulars of climate change. On our production blog, Pertinent Posts from the On Being Blog, we give you behind-the-scenes stories and sources of our information. I encourage you to read about our efforts and contribute your own knowledge and experience. We look forward to reading those comments. And I\u2019d like to invite you to participate in a community narrative we\u2019re producing over the summer. There are so many dire scenarios of ecology, sustainability, and climate. But, on the other side of despair, we keep hearing about new realities emerging \u2014 causes for renewed hope about what\u2019s before us. We\u2019d like for you to share what this means for you. It could be a place \u2014 a prairie night sky or an urban garden. It could be an interaction with a neighbor or a local farmer \u2014 something that makes you contemplate the deeper meanings of possession of land and its care. So, paint a picture for us \u2014 in words or with photographs \u2014 and we\u2019ll create a multimedia narrative that moves beyond numbers and statistics. Look for the Share Your Story link on our home page, speakingoffaith.org."
