  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. At the age of 21, Shane Claiborne co-founded a small community, The Simple Way, in a row house in one of the poorest neighborhoods of Philadelphia. He is a galvanizing figure and creative spirit within a constellation of movements called the New Monasticism. These mostly young people model their communities in some contrast to the churches they grew up in. They\u2019ve patterned their lives in direct response to the human needs and spiritual hungers in the world around them. And they find sustenance at the heart of historic Christianity, from the likes of St. Francis of Assisi, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King Jr. We had all kinds of baggage from the church. You know, recovering evangelicals and disenchanted Catholics, and, you know? And we just said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop complaining about the church that we\u2019ve experienced and try to become the church that we dream of.\u2019 This is On Being. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Shane Claiborne is an original voice, a leading spirit in a gathering movement of young people known as the New Monastics. Monastic orders always formed as forces for renewal along the edges of historic Christianity. These \u201CNew Monastics\u201D have emerged from the edges of modern evangelical Christianity, though their appeal extends far beyond it. With virtues like simplicity and imagination, they are taking on the gap between the churches they were raised in and what they perceive as the essence of Christianity. They\u2019re patterning their lives in response to the needs of the poor and the detachment they see in our culture\u2019s vision of adulthood. From American Public Media, this is On Being, conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CA Monastic Revolution: Meeting Shane Claiborne.\u201D Some young fans have called Shane Claiborne \u201Cthe coolest Christian ever.\u201D Tall and lanky, with signature dreadlocks and goatee, he looks the part. But he lives a deeply pragmatic and challenging vision. In his book The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical, he describes it like this, \u201CWe are trying to raise up an army, not simply of street activists but of lovers \u2014 a community of people who have fallen desperately in love with God and with suffering people, and who allow those relationships to disturb and transform them.\u201D Though Shane Claiborne and other new monastics find much to criticize in the forms of church they grew up in, they are theological thinkers. They find their role models at the heart of Christian tradition \u2014 St. Francis of Assisi, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Dorothy Day. Shane Claiborne\u2019s life tells some of the recent story of politicized evangelicalism that gained prominence in the U.S. But he also embodies an intriguing and lesser-told story of how some in new generations have examined that experience and are living beyond it. I spoke with him in 2007. I was raised in the Bible Belt down in East Tennessee, sort of suffocated with Christianity. Right. You know, and I felt like the Christianity I grew up with really sort of looked at the world and said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s fallen apart, but there is life after death.\u2019 While a lot of us were really asking, \u2018Is there life before death?\u2019 you know, and \u2018Doesn\u2019t our faith have just anything to speak into the world that we\u2019re living in?\u2019 I became pretty disenchanted with a lot of the church culture that I grew up with and just felt like I was asking bigger questions than they were willing to trust me with. You became also quite involved in politics. Yeah, I did. I mean, in Christian politics, in a kind of conservative Christian politics as that evolved in the last 10, 15 years. Surely. And I organized the Bush-Quayle campaign in 1992, and met Dan Quayle. And \u2026 Right. I was always passionate no matter what I felt about different issues. I loved, you know, debate. And so I had strong views about abortion and homosexuality. But I didn\u2019t know any gay folks. And I didn\u2019t know anyone that, you know, had had an abortion or many, you know, folks that were, who were struggling. Who would admit to it, right? Yeah. I guess it\u2019s what gives me a little bit of grace with other people, is I see how much people have had a lot of grace and patience with me in my continual evolution of thought and faith. And that gives me a lot of grace with others. And then you went to a Christian college. You know, what\u2019s intriguing in your story is you were very interested in these spiritual questions. You wanted to know more about Christianity and apply your mind to it. And it seems to me that that really began to happen in North Philadelphia for you \u2014 not so much in the classroom or in church \u2026 Right. \u2026 but among homeless people. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my first encounter with Kensington in North Philly was when there was a group of poor and homeless families with the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, which was just a group of mostly homeless women and children that had gotten together. And they did something really courageous. In the midst of the ruins of North Philadelphia where there\u2019s, you know, over 20,000 abandoned houses and 700 abandoned factories, they found an abandoned Catholic church building, and they moved into it. And we read about that in college. And the newspaper article that we read said that these families had resurrected the church, you know? And that they had also, ironically, been given an ultimatum eviction notice \u2014 that within 48 hours, if they weren\u2019t out, they could face arrest for trespassing on church property. So that really stirred all kinds of deep questions in us. And a group of us from the college got involved and, basically, put our lives alongside theirs and said to the city, \u2018If you come to evict them, then you got to take us, too.\u2019 And over 100 students \u2026 Wow. \u2026 eventually got involved in this. And that made a big difference. Because the media became very involved and now \u2026 Right. \u2026 you know, we were all facing arrest as well. And they made it look like the church was kicking homeless people out. And that\u2019s because the church was kicking homeless people out, you know? Right. And so, it just lasted not for 48 hours, but for weeks and weeks and weeks that we were there. And, I mean, it had a happy ending, didn\u2019t it? They didn\u2019t get evicted. And is it right that those homeless families had, for the most part, found a place to live by the time you all left? It was incredible, what happened. Folks saw it on the news. And they bought houses or donated houses. Some Section 8 and low-income housing vouchers were released. And there were hard stories, but there were also beautiful stories. And those families have been our theologians. You know, they\u2019ve been our teachers \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 and sociologists, and the folks that have really opened our eyes up to the world. You know, you also, you write a lot about miracles. So I think the hard question a cynic would ask is why didn\u2019t God work the miracle beforehand of giving them jobs and enough money and to have safe places to live, rather than have to go through that ordeal? Yeah, it\u2019s a great question, I think. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been asking for years and years. And I can remember a comic in Philadelphia that was in the paper. There were these two guys that were asking that very question. It was \u2014 and one guy said, \u2018You know, I wonder why God allows all this poverty and pain and hurting in the world?\u2019 And his friend says, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you ask God that?\u2019 And the guy says, \u2018Well, I guess I\u2019m scared.\u2019 And he says, \u2018What are you scared of?\u2019 He says, \u2018I guess I\u2019m scared that God will ask me the same question.\u2019 And I think that in some ways, when we\u2019ve put all of this on God \u2026 Right. It\u2019s as if God has been throwing it back and going, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re my body. You are my hands and my feet.\u2019 And, you know, that this is something that we are entrusted with. And I think, probably, one of the most difficult things that Jesus ever did was sort of leave this idea of transforming the world or the kingdom of God coming in the hands of such a ragtag bunch of people that goof it up over and over. The following year, 1997, when Shane Claiborne was 21, he and a few friends from his college, Eastern University cofounded an intentional community in that same Kensington neighborhood. They called it The Simple Way. Over time it has grown from one house to six, including both single and married people with children. They all commit to \u201Csingleness\u201D or monogamy, and to contemplation and action intertwined. But before Shane Claiborne settled back in North Philadelphia, he went looking, as he puts it, for \u201Creal Christians\u201D in the contemporary world. And he ended up seeking out Mother Teresa in India in the last year of her life. You know, I start reading this stuff that Jesus said. And I\u2019m just, like, \u2018Man, does anyone really believe this anymore?\u2019 And Mother Teresa was one of those people that I felt just lived so magnetically and authentically the simple words and teaching of Jesus. So we wrote her a letter, you know? Yeah. We said, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t know if you give internships out there in Calcutta, but we\u2019d love to come work.\u2019 And we didn\u2019t hear back. And I guess she got a lot of mail. Yeah. But we, we ended up just calling some of her sisters on the phone. And they gave us a phone number. So we called Calcutta. And I\u2019m expecting a polite, \u2018Missionaries of Charity, how can we help you?\u2019 or something, you know? And I just hear this raspy, old voice go, \u2018Hello?\u2019 you know? And I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got the wrong number and it\u2019s $4 a minute, you know? So I started talking really fast. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re trying to get hold of the Missionaries of Charity or Mother Teresa\u2019s order out there, the Sisters.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, this is the Missionaries of Charity. This is Mother Teresa.\u2019 And, you know, and I\u2019m like, \u2018And I\u2019m the pope. You know, what are you talking about?\u2019 And so, finally, I started asking her, you know, \u2018Well, can we come out and work?\u2019 And she says, \u2018Yeah, come on out.\u2019 And then I asked her what I think are logical follow-up questions, you know? \u2018Well, where are we going to sleep? What are we going to eat?\u2019 And she didn\u2019t worry a whole lot about those things. She just said to us, \u2018Well, God takes care of the lilies and the sparrows, and God will take care of you.\u2019 So I don\u2019t know how you argue with that one, so we just, we went over there. And I worked there with other close friends of mine. And several of us have been over other times in the past 10 years. But it\u2019s, she was just a beautiful life, I think, well lived. And you worked in a leper colony there. And, you know, that has such biblical echoes. And also \u2026 Yeah. Yeah. \u2026 and also, I think it seems, not only to belong to Bible stories \u2014 for people in this culture, but to a world that surely doesn\u2019t exist anymore, right? Lepers surely don\u2019t exist anymore? Right. Yeah. What did you learn there in that work about the Bible? Boy, yeah, I learned so much. I think part of what I learned was, that it wasn\u2019t just enough to protest the things that were wrong in the world. Because I think we had been sucked up into this real movement of social justice, and going out and getting arrested and protesting everything that was wrong. So we knew what we were against. We just didn\u2019t know we were for, you know? And in that leper colony, I learned from a group of people, who had been, basically, forced by their society to create a new society in the shell of the old one. So it\u2019s really there that I kind of caught that vision of let\u2019s build something new together, you know? As one of my heroes, Dorothy Day, said, \u201CLet\u2019s build a society where it\u2019s easier for people to be good to each other,\u201D you know? Right. And was it from there that you went back to Philadelphia and founded the community you now live in, The Simple Way? Yeah, it was. There was a group of us out of that student movement that ended up going, \u2018Let\u2019s try to do church like, like the old days,\u2019 you know? We would read in the Book of Acts that all of the believers were together and shared everything in common. No one claimed any of their possessions were their own, but they shared everything. And there were no needy persons among them. Right. That\u2019s exactly what it says in the Book of Acts. And we said, \u2018We want to try to live like that.\u2019 And there was surely a moment where we had all kinds of baggage from the church, you know, recovering evangelicals and disenchanted Catholics. Right. And, you know, and we just said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop complaining about the church that we\u2019ve experienced and try to become the church that we dream of.\u2019 Hmm. Tell me how it works, The Simple Way. I mean, how many people are there in the community? And what is your \u2014 you are called New Monastics. I mean, do you, do you have a rule of life the way old monastics do, the ancient monastic orders? Well, first, I \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I guess it\u2019s important to know, too, that we\u2019ve been doing it for 10 years, you know? Yeah. And so sort of stumbled into everything. We had no idea what we were doing. We were pretty pretentious when we started. And we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re doing church for the first time in hundreds of years, you know?\u2019 Right. Yeah. And there were six of us. And we just put our money together. And we, we got a house in North Philadelphia. And then we had no huge visions for transforming our neighborhood or something. We were coming very much as learners. And we opened our door up to people. Our mission was just to love God, love people, and follow Jesus. And we said, \u2018If we can figure that out, then we\u2019ll be doing well,\u2019 you know? And \u2026 Were you all kind of just out of college, 22, 23? Yeah. That\u2019s right. And so we had a lot of homeless folks that came by the house; we had a lot of kids that needed help with homework. And everything that we do just sort of bubbled up out of that, you know? And in North Philly, we\u2019ve \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of struggles, but there\u2019s also a lot of hope. And so we tried to feed each other hope and to reclaim abandoned spaces. So, you know you\u2019re important, Krista, because I came down here after \u2014 I\u2019m missing out on all the gardening today. We\u2019re reclaiming two lots on our block where they were formerly just filled with trash and needles. And we\u2019re reclaiming that space and doing gardens with our neighborhood. Here we are in the Neighborhood Garden, also a part of the Eve\u2019s Garden Initiative. And, basically, in the Neighborhood Garden, what we do, as much as possible, is grow vegetables that people from the neighborhood consume the most. A lot of the garden has been grown and worked on through children in the neighborhood coming to the summer gardening program. The garden is going to be empty because we\u2019re digging all of the stuff. OK. My grandma is going to cook black-eyed peas. So, if anybody wants to come over to eat black-eyed peas, you are welcome. The mint family is very good for congestion in the head and in the chest, and a lot of the kids here have asthma. And so, one thing that can be done just to help them feel immediate relief is making some kind of a mint tea and adding mint to a medicinal mixture, also improves the taste for children. We have oregano and sage \u2026 So, all those things just sort of have bubbled up out of living there, and all the programs that we do sort of evolved based on ideas of neighbors and things. So we have a little thrift store. We \u2014 and as soon as I leave here, we\u2019ll be giving out about 50 bags of food to folks that need food and \u2014 those sorts of things. But I think it\u2019s also that we\u2019ve, initially, when we started the community, we were just responding to crisis, you know, and needs, and everything. And then there comes a point where Dr. Martin Luther King said so well, he said, \u201CWe\u2019re called to be the Good Samaritan and lift our neighbor out of the ditch. But after you lift so many people out of the ditch, you start to say, \u2018Maybe the whole road to Jericho needs to be transformed.'\u201D Right. So I think the question an American has to ask is, how is it funded? What\u2019s the financial set up? How do you afford to give away 50 bags of groceries? Well it\u2019s really fun because I think what we\u2019ve learned is by living in community just like you hear the saying, \u201Cmany hands make for light work,\u201D is when we share stuff, we have an abundance of resources that we begin to see. So as we moved in together and started sharing finances and sharing things together, we create a very sustainable way of life. So we have one car that we all share together, we share a washer and dryer and houses and everything. And the way that it works financially for us is that we all work part-time jobs and doing things that we love, you know? So we have a massage therapist and a carpenter and a bike messenger and \u2026 And you write books. Yeah, and I write books and speak. That\u2019s a crazy job. And \u2026 Yeah. And so \u2014 but we do things that we love, and then we pool our money together in order to meet our own needs. And then we get tons of donations from all over the country to help us give school supplies to 500 kids, you know, and do the community gardens and all those things. And we also try to restore a lot of stuff that\u2019s getting thrown out, by sort of a disposable society, you know, where a lot of our food we get, that\u2019s being thrown away, you know? So if you come to a potluck at our house, it says vegetarian, vegan, and rescued, you know? And \u201Crescued\u201D means right out of the trash. OK. Yeah. But one of the exciting things that we have going on now is trying to start up some incubator businesses that create some jobs in our neighborhoods and community. So, one of those that\u2019s pretty neat is we have vegetable oil that we gather from around the city and are converting it to biodiesel or running cars off of it so that several of our communities have converted their cars to where they run off of used vegetable oil and \u2026 Can people do that to their own car, to a regular car? Yeah, yeah. And it\u2019s great. I didn\u2019t know that. But the way that we\u2019re doing that, too, is out of a \u2014 one of our sister communities called New Jerusalem, and everyone there is in recovery from drug and alcohol addictions, and they are providing jobs for themselves through that business. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from American Public Media. Today, \u201CA Monastic Revolution: Meeting Shane Claiborne.\u201D We\u2019re exploring how some young evangelicals have been reimagining church, and having a magnetic effect beyond it. You know, there\u2019s something in the way you, not just the way you see your Christianity, but the way you look at the world. It\u2019s a very holistic vision. There\u2019s a self-awareness. There\u2019s kind of a global sensibility. So, for example, you\u2019ve taken the old adage that if you give someone a fish, they\u2019ll eat for a day. But if you teach them how to fish, they can eat for a lifetime. Right? But you say, we also need to ask who owns the pond and who polluted it? Right. I mean, that\u2019s new, I think. And I\u2019m not sure people, human beings have previously been free, been \u2014 lived in a world where they could think that way, or see all the connections. Have you thought about this? About your generation and this time? Everywhere I go, I am so encouraged by the questions that people are asking, especially, even within the evangelical church that\u2019s been so scared of a lot of those questions. And, I think, some of the more damaging views that we\u2019ve had around from the religious right and stuff of folks going on. Well, you know, global warming is just something that takes us off track from the important issues, like homosexuality, you know? Right. Right. It\u2019s just, like, what in the world, you know? Most people my age that I see, even within the evangelical church, like, transcend those categories of left and right, and really are wanting to know how to create a better world and know that the world that we\u2019ve been handed is very fragile. And I love when Jesus said that if the Christians are silent, then the rocks will cry out. And I think now he would say, maybe, \u2018The rock stars will cry out,\u2019 you know? I mean, there\u2019s a lot of Christians though that are going, \u2018We don\u2019t just need, you know, these celebrities to work out, you know, to change the world. We need to figure out how to live differently ourselves and how to live with some imagination and some creativity, and give ourselves for something bigger than just our own little circle of friends.\u2019 And so, that, to me, that\u2019s so encouraging. And I\u2019m convinced that if the Christian church loses this generation, it will be not because we didn\u2019t entertain them, but because we didn\u2019t dare them, you know, with the truth of the world. And it won\u2019t be because we\u2019d made the Gospel too hard, but because we made it too easy, and we just played games with kids and didn\u2019t actually challenge them to think about how they live. You know, you also made a really interesting observation, I think. Now, you\u2019ve been saying some critical things about the religious right, but you\u2019re also, you\u2019re quite critical of liberals and progressives. I mean, you want to get away from all the boxes, I think. And you\u2019ve written about being disturbed by flags in churches and by the patriotism that gets mixed up in American Christianity and, certainly, in the time of war, it gets mixed up. And you wrote of this post-9/11 period: \u201CThis burst of nationalism reveals the deep longing we all have for community, a natural thirst for intimacy that liberals and progressive Christians would have done much better to acknowledge.\u201D Say some more about that. Yeah. I think that a part of my own journey gives me this sense of invitation for people to ask those questions in ways that we \u2014 because I\u2019ve floated in the side of conservativism and in the side of progressive, you know, liberalism \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 you know, I\u2019ve seen, in both of those circles, sort of a self-righteousness, you know, that marks itself by how pure it\u2019s become. And, you know, and in East Tennessee, that meant, like, we didn\u2019t listen to Metallica, right? Right. Or we didn\u2019t listen to any secular music. And thank God, I\u2019m not like those people, you know? And yet, like, on the other side of things, I really felt some of that within the social justice circles, that it was, like, \u2018Thank you that we only eat organic,\u2019 you know? \u2018We,\u2019 you know, \u2018we aren\u2019t defiled by those others,\u2019 you know? Right. And so, it was \u2014 it makes us feel good just by making everybody else feel how bad they are. And I think, what I really love about much of what\u2019s happening in the younger generation is there\u2019s a sense that, man, we all have a lot of contradictions and we don\u2019t need to feel like we have it all figured out. There\u2019s something just as magnetic as a church that seems to, like, pretend that we\u2019ve all got it together, which is definitely the church that I grew up in, you know? Right. There\u2019s something magnetic about a group of people that say, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t have it all figured out, and we need each other.\u2019 And for me, that was a story \u2014 what happened after September 11th is that some people, you know, they just rallied around the flag and the church community, and I went to those congregations and spoke at some of them, you know, and \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 and other folks rallied in the streets. And yet, there \u2014 from many sides, there was such a polarity of anger and homogeneity that everybody was just with their own people, and \u2026 Right. \u2026 I was really hurt by that because I think we would do well to just acknowledge the vulnerability of the moment and respond well in the midst of that. And I think of how the Amish responded to the shooting in their school, you know, and how tragic that was. And yet their instinct was to go and, you know, be with the murderer\u2019s family and go to the funeral of the one that killed some of their kids and send resources there, you know? Since I had this conversation with Shane Claiborne in 2007, a lot has happened. He\u2019s published another book, his community\u2019s original house burned down, and he\u2019s traveled worldwide speaking about his work. We reached out to him and asked how he stays connected to The Simple Way and its intentional lifestyle \u2014 as his popularity and demand grow. You can read his candid answers on our blog, Pertinent Posts from the On Being Blog. And, you can also watch him on stage with Evangelical leaders Chuck Colson and Greg Boyd. He participated with them in a passionate, cross-generational dialogue I led at a gathering of ministers about the role of Christians in U.S. politics. Find video of that conversation and download an MP3 of this show at speakingoffaith.org. After a short break, how Shane Claiborne navigates the goal of love and the reality of violence with children in his neighborhood. Also, new forms of community that he sees emerging in the lives of people young and old. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. On Being comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to On Being, conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CA Monastic Revolution: Meeting Shane Claiborne.\u201D He co-founded an intentional community called The Simple Way, in North Philadelphia, when he was just out of college in 1997. I interviewed him in 2007, and he has continued since then to grow in prominence as a leading figure at the intersection of a number of movements, primarily of young people, that are reimagining the essence of Christianity. His book The Irresistible Revolution is a best-seller, especially among young Christians and churches who are seeking to understand them. He is also a sought-out speaker and writer in ever-expanding spheres of visibility. In December 2009, Esquiremagazine invited Shane Claiborne to write an open letter to nonbelievers. It included these lines: \u201CI am sorry that so often the biggest obstacle to God has been Christians. \u2026 Forgive us for the embarrassing things we have done in the name of God.\u201D As he was telling us earlier, Shane Claiborne and others were galvanized in part by what they experienced as the distortions caused by evangelical Christian involvement in U.S. electoral politics. Yet they question the smugness of both right and left in polarizing American culture. They\u2019re more concerned with connecting the dots between local human needs and global crises. Shane Claiborne went to Iraq just as war broke out in March 2003. Here he is speaking at a gathering of the Christian Community Development Association after that experience. Because I\u2019ve seen a lot of hard things this year and actually, I brought a couple of things that symbolize those, I\u2019ve been carrying them with me. One is \u2014 this is a shell of a bullet on the corner of my neighborhood where one of the young men was killed. And this is the shell of a bomb from Baghdad. And I\u2019ve been holding those with me because in a lot of ways, this year, for the first time, I experienced firsthand the violence of our neighborhoods, and I was a victim of an attack. And I had a broken jaw and I couldn\u2019t talk for a month. That was right after being back from witnessing the most horrific violence I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in Baghdad. So as I hold these two things, I\u2019m reminded of the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said: \u201CThese are extreme times. And the question isn\u2019t whether or not we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will you be extremists for love or for hatred?\u201D My theology is very practical theology. It didn\u2019t come out of reading books by good Mennonites or something. Yeah. It came out of, you know, trying to teach kids that it takes more courage to confront someone that\u2019s violent with nonaggression and still confront it, you know? And so we teach kids that. So one kid came home, I remember, years back, and a kid was picking on him. And he\u2019s like, \u2018Aw, this kid, you know, keeps beating me up, they\u2019re calling me names.\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you know what, Rolando, that means that you\u2019ve got to show him what a friend looks like, because they may not know what it\u2019s like to be a good friend. They may not have had good friends before, so you get to show them.\u2019 And Rolando goes, \u2018Oh, man. Love is so hard.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s the love that Dostoevsky speaks of when he said, it\u2019s not love that, you know, not a sentimental love like storybooks, but it\u2019s a harsh and dreadful love that we\u2019re talking about. But you know, it\u2019s a big responsibility for you to be telling a kid who\u2019s facing true, potentially dangerous bullying to go back and love them. I mean, does that ever backfire? Does that ever not work? Well, I think that\u2019s true. And I think that Jesus, when he\u2019s telling us these things like turn the other cheek, he\u2019s speaking to people who had been slapped. You know, he\u2019s speaking to people who are peasants and revolutionaries and people that were confronted with violence every single day. And yet, it\u2019s not a cowardly, like, just sort of, \u2018Well just get stepped on.\u2019 But I think every one of the instances that Jesus is showing us in the Sermon on the Mount when he says, you know, \u201CIf a person slaps you on your cheek, turn your other cheek. And if someone asks you to walk a mile, go two miles.\u201D All these things were very real realities that confronted evil, but not on its own terms. Confronted evil without mirroring evil. Right. And in fact, just a couple of weeks ago, I was walking down the street with Kasim, who\u2019s a young man on my block, and a bunch of teenagers jumped us, and they started calling us names and throwing stuff at us, and they were just ready for a fight, you know? They\u2019re just trying to stir it up, and we keep walking and then, I said, \u2018You know, let\u2019s not run from them. Let\u2019s go back.\u2019 And we introduced ourselves and Kasim is thinking, like, \u2018What in the world?\u2019 You know, we introduced ourselves to them. And I said, \u2018My name is Shane. This is Kasim.\u2019 And they totally didn\u2019t know what to do with that, you know, they\u2019re ready to fight. And, then we keep walking and then one of them hits my friend, Kasim, on the head with a club. And I mean, at that moment, my instinct is like \u2018God, where are you? You know, why didn\u2019t you, we tried not to fight these kids,\u2019 you know? Right. And then I turned around and I don\u2019t know what happened. It just sort of snapped for me. And I looked at them and I said, \u2018You guys are created in the image of God and you\u2019re made for something better than this.\u2019 These kids looked at us and they were \u2014 they had no idea what to do with that. They just sort of, like, disintegrated into every different direction, you know? And Kasim looks at me and he goes, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018I don\u2019t know what it was,\u2019 you know? Was he all right? Oh, yeah. He was OK. And he came home. And listen to what he said. He said, when we got home, he goes, \u2018Shane, you know, we get to go to bed tonight, thinking that we acted like Jesus. And those kids have to go to bed thinking about how they acted.\u2019 And this is just a middle school kid, you know. And we sat down, and we prayed for those kids, and we thought about it. And I said, \u2018Kasim, I don\u2019t know what Jesus would have done in our place,\u2019 you know? I know one thing, he would not have run from those kids, and he would not have hit those kids.\u2019 To me, the idea that we can look in the face of evil and say that you are better than the worst things that you do, it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful story. And that\u2019s what I see in the lives of people like Dr. Martin Luther King, is his scandalous love for even the people that are inflicting violence on him. So he, you know, Dr. King says: \u201CYou can threaten our children and we will still love you. You can burn down our houses and we will still love you. You can put us in jail and put your dogs on us and we will still love you. But be ye assured that we will wear you down by our love.\u201D And I love that because it\u2019s a story of the martyrs. It\u2019s the story of our faith. And I want to ask you, there\u2019s a phenomenon, and I\u2019m talking to you, you\u2019ve been following this passion for over a decade and you still have \u2014 you have so much passion, so much energy and you\u2019re, you know, one thing that I\u2019ve heard a lot about talking to religious people who are involved in the civil rights movement is that they are followed this period of burnout. You know, that\u2019s also a really common story in social justice causes. And have you gone through periods where you were more dry? And, you know, how do you imagine not becoming depleted or not becoming cynical? Because cynicism is often something that follows in the wake of movements like this. Have you thought about this? Yeah. Well, I think that something I\u2019ve learned in being in social justice circles is that \u2014 in conservative or liberal circles for that matter is that there\u2019s often something that everybody has in common is that we don\u2019t have joy. You know, and we don\u2019t have celebration or laughter. And I have \u2014 we have so \u2026 It\u2019s very serious stuff. Yeah. Yeah. We have so much fun, like, I live with people who \u2014 we laugh hard together and we cry hard together, too. I think what community is, is surrounding yourself with people who are like the person you want to become. And for me, I also keep a really good rhythm of life, like I have a very disciplined life of, you know, getting up in the morning for prayer, and we have a Sabbath day where we just rest together, you know, and we don\u2019t answer the door or the phone. And so all those things are sort of a part of our integrated faith and who we are and things that we share together. And we have meals together as a community, and we function a lot like a family. So that keeps us, I think, very energized for the long haul. But I mean, families have hard times and families have struggles and irritations. I mean living in proximity, I\u2019ve heard this also from monastics, traditional monastics, that they have all the kind of irritations and necessity of forgiveness that any family has. I mean, have you had periods of despair or of discouragement? Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t know if we have enough time for all of that. But we \u2014 for sure, we \u2014 you know, and I think that like for instance, drug addiction is huge. You know, we are a block from one of the most notorious heroin corners in Philadelphia. And that\u2019s something that I think drove us to the very brink of collapse because we had folks living with us. I mean, we\u2019re trying to hold this vision of \u2018We\u2019ll just live with the doors unlocked,\u2019 you know? We had people that came and stole our car and stole our refrigerator and our Crockpot. That was sort of the end of the line, the Crockpot. You know, I mean these are things that we\u2019re trying to use to take care of folks. And then we \u2014 but then we look at ourselves and we go, \u2018Well, why do we stink so bad at, you know, dealing with addiction?\u2019 And we\u2019re, like, \u2018Well, none of us have used heroin.\u2019 How about that for starters, you know? And so then we began really having this deliberate relationship with New Jerusalem, the recovery community. And we have this sense that we\u2019re a part of a body. And that\u2019s refreshing to know that we don\u2019t have to be the full picture of everything that\u2019s going to happen in our neighborhood or in our world, but we work out what we do best and try to harmonize with other, you know, communities and voices as best we can. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from American Public Media. Today, \u201CA Monastic Revolution: Meeting Shane Claiborne.\u201D Do you think of yourself as being part of a revolution, a kind of revolution? I \u2026 That\u2019s a word you\u2019ve used. And you can hear my hesitation. Yes. I\u2019m careful because I don\u2019t ever want to fall in love with a movement or a revolution. You know, I think that Jesus\u2019 life shows me that revolution is not a big thing, but it\u2019s a very small thing. You know that we\u2019ve got to live it in small ways out of little communities. And Dietrich Bonhoeffer who has been a good teacher for us on community, he says, \u201CThe person who\u2019s \u2026 German theologian who died in a Nazi prison. Yeah. And one of the things that Dietrich Bonhoeffer says is \u201CThe person who\u2019s in love with their vision of community will destroy community. But the person who loves the people around them will create community everywhere they go.\u201D And I think that that\u2019s something that\u2019s held us together is not just to fall in love with a movement or a revolution, but to try to live in radical ways and in simple ways. Because I think that the world right now is undergoing a beautiful transition of thought and in young people within the church, there\u2019s so much that\u2019s hopeful. Talk to me about some of the people in the communities who, for you, are defining the present or, you know, participating in this new imagination that you describe. Boy, there\u2019s so many different communities that give me a lot of hope. And some of them are folks just like \u2014 I met a suburban family that said, \u2018We\u2019re trying to figure out what it means to love our neighbor as ourself. And for us, it means that for every biological child that we send to college, we\u2019re creating a scholarship fund and making sure that an at-risk youth can go to college. And we get to know their family and, you know, interact with them and help make that happen.\u2019 And then I met a bunch of kids that said, \u2018You know, we\u2019re trying to figure out how to find the Calcutta around us.\u2019 As Mother Teresa said, \u201CCalcuttas are everywhere if we only have eyes to see.\u201D Right. Find your own Calcutta. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And they said, \u2018So we started looking around and we found this old folks\u2019 home and we went in.\u2019 And these are actually, I should say, they\u2019re kind of preppy teenage girls, you know, like cheerleaders and stuff. All right. Where are they? So we found \u2014 this was out in Western Pennsylvania. OK. And they said, \u2018We were \u2014 so we\u2019re trying to find this little, the retirement home. We went in and we asked for all of the women who don\u2019t have any visitors or family. And so we go and we visit them and we paint their fingernails and toenails and we just listen to their story.\u2019 And I love it because it\u2019s unique, you know. And there\u2019s all kinds of expressions of people that are beginning to experience life just outside of the detached nuclear family. OK. You know, and are seeing that bring themselves to life. And one of the great examples of that was a married couple that I stayed with. And they said, you know, \u2018We were unable to have children as a married couple.\u2019 And they were about 50 years old. And they said, \u2018But then we were walking through our neighborhood and we met this woman who had found herself homeless and she was six months pregnant. And so we said, \u201CMy gosh, you know, you got, you can\u2019t be on the streets.\u201D\u2018 So they brought her back to their house and said, \u2018You know, we\u2019ll figure this out as we go.\u2019 And they really hit it off together. And they said, \u2018If you want to have your child while you\u2019re living here with us, we would love to be a part of that process because we\u2019ve always wanted to have a kid,\u2019 you know. And so, she did. She had her kid there, living in their home. And it was so amazing that they continued to live together and raise the child. And then, they said to this mother, they said, \u2018Well, what are your dreams, you know? We\u2019re getting to live out one of ours.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to go to nursing school.\u2019 So they said, \u2018Well, we will take care of your kid and help you financially if you want to go to nursing school,\u2019 and so she did. And I just went back to visit them and they\u2019ve lived together for over 10 years. The woman who\u2019s formerly homeless is a nurse. That little girl that she had is almost a teenager now. And the amazing thing is that the woman of that married couple now has multiple sclerosis and she\u2019s dying, but she\u2019s got a nurse living in her home with her, taking care of her as she dies. So I think those expressions are, they\u2019re all over the place, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful. You know \u2014 you call yourself a radical and you draw on the root of that word, which is driving to the core. And yet, you know, you\u2019re having a quite a bit of success. You have a book that sold a lot of copies, that people are reading. You\u2019re speaking all over the country. It was hard for us to pin down a time to have you on the show. I mean, do you worry about what our culture does to success, even if it comes from the best of intentions? Do you worry about what our culture does to saints? Because I think that some people probably are setting you up as a very cool but saintly figure. Well, I think one thing that community does is it keeps you very grounded, you know? OK. We make sure that, because you see each other at your best and your worst. And I am, to me it\u2019s such a gift to have a group of people that I live with and that I\u2019m accountable to and that don\u2019t take me too seriously. OK. And I love when Dorothy Day said, \u2018Don\u2019t call us saints because we don\u2019t want to be dismissed that easily.\u2019 How would you respond to someone who said, \u2018Well, you know, these stories you tell about good things happening are beautiful in these communities, but it\u2019s anecdotal and it\u2019s just one person here, one person there, one small group of people here, one small group of people there. Why, you\u2019re not going to really change the world.\u2019 And how would you \u2014 how do you respond to that? Well, I\u2019d say if we looked a little closer at history, we see that that\u2019s the only way it\u2019s ever been done, you know, and that these groups of people begin to come together and ripple new imagination and ideas that are very contagious. And I especially look at the story of my faith, you know. And Jesus\u2019 chooses this little group of people where, what a bunch of, you know, goofballs. I mean, one of them denies him, another betrays him, and another doubts him. And yet, it\u2019s that little group of people that, even in the midst of that brokenness, I think, is a testimony of God\u2019s goodness, and that the movement builds. And the Christian mystics know that so well because they say that \u2018God\u2019s spirit comes through the cracks and not through the togetherness.\u2019 I would say that one thing that\u2019s been so encouraging, after writing the book, is just having letters come in, you know. And I try to write folks back, and especially people that have said, \u2018I knew that there was more to Christianity than just, you know, patriotic pastors and cover-up bishops and all these horrible, you know, things that we\u2019ve seen and over and over, folks that are, you know, sexual minorities and people that have really felt themselves completely outside the church.\u2019 And I am so encouraged by that. And I even had a, some folks in a mosque that told me that they were reading my book together in a study group. Really? It\u2019s like, oh my gosh. That\u2019s exactly some of the, you know, the most encouraging things that I would see. In the South, where I\u2019m from, you know, we have a saying that you\u2019re \u201Cthe spittin\u2019 image\u201D of somebody. You know, I got told I\u2019m the spittin\u2019 image of my grandfather all the time, and it\u2019s shorthand for \u201Cthe spirit and image,\u201D you know. And it doesn\u2019t just mean you look like them but that you have the character of them. Oh. I didn\u2019t know that. And so, in a lot of ways, I guess what I hope that we are seeing is Christians who are beginning to be, again, the spitting image of Christ, you know, that are starting to look like and do the things that Jesus did and not be totally distracted by those which have proclaimed the name of Christ and done so many other things. You know, there\u2019s a lot of speculation about this Gen Y, you know, I\u2019ve heard the we-not-me generation and then, I\u2019ve heard other studies that say they are more selfish and self-obsessed than any previous generation. And you know, I don\u2019t hold very much, I don\u2019t trust those kinds of analyses of entire swaths of people. But what do you see in the people around you, your age and younger? What do you see as qualities of this generation, in your experience? Well, I can definitely say that they\u2019re \u2014 we are totally overwhelmed by the amount of people who are responding to the message and the witness of the communities that we\u2019re a part of. We get like 20 calls and letters a day of folks that have, that are, like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re so ready for something new, you know. We\u2019re ready for a revolution.\u2019 All right. And are they young? Are they \u2026 Oh, my gosh. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They\u2019re so young. They\u2019ll hitchhike across the country and end up at our door, you know. We\u2019re, like, well, we\u2019re not taking visitors right now, except we did have a visitor that showed up the other day that had hitchhiked up from Liberty University, which is where Jerry Falwell \u2026 All right. \u2026 you know, that\u2019s his school. We\u2019re like, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll make an exception. Come on in,\u2019 you know. But we \u2014 it\u2019s so encouraging that there are people that are out there asking that. I think the world\u2019s a little smaller and folks are, they want to know where their clothes are made. They want to know, you know, where their food comes from. And there are people that, over and over, where I \u2014 I go places that folks have seen the emptiness of the dream that their parents have settled for, where we\u2019ve been sold this idea of the American Dream, that they\u2019ve seen just can end up being loneliness, you know. And can rob us of community and joy and life. And so, they are looking for something more. They want to volunteer. They want to do something bigger than that. And I think that\u2019s why you have, like, folks joining the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps and all these programs, you know. But you also have folks that I think are asking great questions about who, not just what they\u2019re going to do when they grow up, but who they are becoming. And I think that\u2019s a much more important question. It\u2019s not whether or not we\u2019re going to be a lawyer or a doctor but what kind of lawyer or doctor we\u2019re going to be.

And, I\u2019d like to invite you to participate in a community narrative we\u2019re producing over the summer. There are so many dire scenarios of ecology, sustainability, and climate. But, on the other side of despair, we keep hearing about new realities emerging \u2014 a \u201Cbrightening on the path\u201D as Ellen Davis put it \u2014 causes for renewed hope about what\u2019s before us. We\u2019d like for you to share what this means for you. It could be a place \u2014 a prairie night sky or an urban garden. It could be an interaction with a neighbor or a local farmer \u2014 something that makes you contemplate the deeper meanings of possession of land and its care. So, paint a picture for us \u2014 in words or with photographs \u2014 and we\u2019ll create a multimedia narrative that moves beyond numbers and statistics. Look for the Share Your Story link on our home page, speakingoffaith.org."
