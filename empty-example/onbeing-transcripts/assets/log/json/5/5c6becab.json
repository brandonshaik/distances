  "fullText": "Gordon Hempton says that silence is an endangered species. He\u2019s an acoustic ecologist \u2014 a collector of sound all over the world. He defines real quiet as presence \u2014 not an absence of sound, but an absence of noise. The Earth, as Gordon Hempton knows it, is a \u201Csolar-powered jukebox.\u201D Quiet is a \u201Cthink tank of the soul.\u201D We take in the world through his ears. Not too long ago it was assumed that clean water\u2019s not important, that seeing the stars is not that important. But now it is. And now I think we\u2019re realizing quiet is important, and we need silence. That silence is not a luxury, but it\u2019s essential. \u201CThe Last Quiet Places.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Gordon Hempton lives in Joyce, Washington, near Olympic National Park, a place he calls \u201Cthe listener\u2019s Yosemite.\u201D I spoke with him in 2012. He\u2019s recorded inside Sitka spruce logs in the Pacific Northwest, thunder in the Kalahari Desert, dawn breaking across six continents. His work appears in movies, soundtracks, video games, and museums. And Gordon Hempton may have invented \u201Csilence activism\u201D \u2014 the other animating passion of his life. Where did you grow up? I didn\u2019t see that anywhere. As a child, I was a member of a military family, started out in Southern California, then went on to Hawaii, then back to California before going to Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and then I can say about a dozen other places before I got out of high school. So by the time it was my chance to go to college, that\u2019s when I decided I\u2019d fill the space in between by going to the Midwest, the University of Wisconsin. So there wasn\u2019t really \u2014 there\u2019s not really a place where you \u2014 which felt like a center of gravity even with all that moving. Oh, there definitely is, and that is Hawaii. OK. Yeah, the place of Hawaii, a place that I\u2019ve recorded many times in my life, is the first experience I had was when I was 6 weeks old. And then we moved away when I was 4 years old. And I did not revisit the location until 1990 when all of a sudden I discovered that I had all these primal impressions of what it\u2019s like to be home in nature. The smells of Hawaii, the sounds of the surf, of all the places that I\u2019ve recorded in Hawaii, and I\u2019ve recorded all the islands in Hawaii for an exhibit on endangered species for the Smithsonian Institution because Hawaii, unfortunately, has the title of highest density of endangered species. But I found the sound that I enjoyed most was the sound of the silence in the volcano. The measurement of decibels actually goes into the minus point, but there still is a sense of presence, of where you are. Then once you get over the rim of the volcano, you begin to pick up what I call the mantra of the islands, and that\u2019s the distant beating of that drum called the Pacific Ocean. Right. Was there a spiritual tradition or religious tradition in your childhood, in your upbringing? Well, I was raised Episcopalian. And so that meant that every Sunday morning I woke up and had to take that dirty pair of shoes that I always wore to school and then put a fresh layer of shoe polish on them and then go to church. But I would have to say that sitting in church, I really had a hard time listening to the words. But I did enjoy listening to one thing, which is that everybody was coming together for a single purpose, and I particularly enjoyed the singing. I really can\u2019t say that I\u2019m religious today, although I am spiritual. I don\u2019t go to church that\u2019s inside of buildings, but I do go to church that\u2019s outside. My favorite church of all is what I call the \u201CCathedral of the Hoh Rain Forest at Olympic National Park.\u201D It has the world\u2019s tallest trees, over 300 feet high, and it\u2019s there that the least amount of noise pollution intrudes of anywhere else in the United States. And \u2014 we\u2019re going to go back there. We\u2019re going to spend some time there, I mean, in our conversation. Oh, great. I am also, though, very intrigued when I look at your story that you headed in this direction of becoming an acoustic ecologist, which on it\u2019s own, those two words I think are so intriguing and lovely. You started doing that when you were living in a city, in Seattle. Is that right? Well, I did. Actually, acoustic ecology didn\u2019t even exist as a field. I grew up thinking that I was a listener, except on my way to graduate school one time, I simply pulled over making the long drive from Seattle, Washington, to Madison, Wisconsin, pulled over in a field to get some rest, and a thunderstorm rolled over me. While I lay there, and the thunder echoed through the valley, and I could hear the crickets, I just simply took it all in. And it\u2019s then I realized that I had a whole wrong impression of what it meant to actually listen. I thought that listening meant focusing my attention on what was important even before I had heard it and screening out everything that was unimportant even before I had heard it. In other words, I had been paying a lot of attention to people, but I really hadn\u2019t been paying a lot of attention to what is all around me. It was on that day that I really discovered what it means to be alive as another animal in a natural place. That changed my life. I had one question, and that was how could I be 27 years old and have never truly listened before? I knew, for me, I was living life incredibly wrong, so I abandoned all my plans, I dropped out of graduate school, I moved to Seattle, took my day job as a bike messenger and only had one goal, and that was to become a better listener. So there\u2019s growth that comes from discovering something new, and there\u2019s growth for human beings that comes from rediscovering something essential and elemental that we forgot. Mm-hmm. Right. And it feels to me, as I immerse in what you do, that that\u2019s huge, the ways you talk about that sound in fact connects everything, that our ears work all the time, which is why our alarm clocks work, our bodies sleep, but our ears stay awake. And that, as you say, as human beings and as creatures like other creatures from the beginning of time, sound was a central way to make our way through the world. Sound is incredibly important. I\u2019m always floored when I hear over and over again from our modern culture how important vision is. OK, sound is kind of important, but, boy, vision is just\u2026 We\u2019re very picture-centered, aren\u2019t we? Well, of course, we\u2019re picture-centered because there\u2019s so much noise pollution in our modern world today that we become auditory. But I want to go back for a moment and let\u2019s just forget about the modern world, and let\u2019s just look at evolution. Some animal species are actually blind. The ability to see is not essential for survival. There are blind animal species in the back of the caves, in the bottom of the oceans and stuff like this, but sound is so important that every higher vertebrate species has the ability to hear. And sight is such an affordable luxury that eyelids evolved. We can close our eyes. OK, that\u2019s enough of that. I\u2019m just going to close my eyes and take a break. But not once in the fossil record do we have any evidence that a species evolved earlids. That would be far too dangerous. Animals must listen to survive. But here in our modern world, we\u2019ve kind of forgotten that. But if we were to go to a quiet place, sit down in the Hoh Rain Forest, for example, and simply be alone in the silence of nature, that deep ability to listen occurs. And what do we hear? Yeah, what do we hear? Let me ask you that question this way. Walk into the Hoh Rain Forest for me with your ears. Walk us in there with you by sound. OK. So I get out of my car, all right? We\u2019ll still hear the pinging of its engine. We\u2019ll hear other cars and other visitors, and we\u2019ll hear the \u201Cbeep-beep\u201D of our modern world as people are locking their cars and the rustling of our artificial fabrics against our bodies. Some people will be chattering away on cell phones. But then the sound of my backpack goes over my shoulders, and we head off down the trail. And no more than 100 yards along these tall, tree-lined, ferned path with moss drapes that add sound-deadening to the experience, we\u2019ll hear the call-off twitter of a Winter Wren, this very high-pitched twittering sound that might be coming from 100 feet away. And then we\u2019ll hear further away the sound of the Hoh River that drains the Rain Forest echoing off the far side of the valley. And if we were taking this hike in the fall, we would hear the bugling of the Roosevelt elk. Up close, it\u2019s actually quite a guttural, adrenalin-filled assertion of what it means to be male and wild. But when you hear this experience from a couple of miles away, isn\u2019t that amazing? When you\u2019re in a quiet place, your listening horizon extends for miles in every direction. When you hear an elk call from miles away, it turns into a magic flute as the result of traveling through this place that has the same acoustics as a cathedral. I hear the presence of everything. Nothing shouts importance, and often I actually hike to One Square Inch of Silence with another person and we agree not to talk while we\u2019re there. And often the hike in is a chattery experience coming from urban lives, etc., but the hike out is hardly talking at all. And if we talk, we always whisper. Quiet is quieting. One Square Inch of Silence, which Gordon Hempton just mentioned, is his project to preserve the natural soundscape in Olympic National Park\u2019s backcountry wilderness. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton. You have said that silence, and you mean that silence you just described, is an endangered species. I mean, is it right? Oh, boy. Silence is so endangered, we even need another word for it. Silence is on the verge of extinction. Places in nature that never have any noise pollution are already gone. The modern measure of silence is the noise-free interval. Now we might think the noise-free interval should be measured in hours for places that are very distant on the planet and even some places here that are isolated such as Olympic National Park off the northwest corner of Washington State. But if a place can have a noise-free interval of only 15 minutes or longer during daylight hours, it\u2019s added to the list that I\u2019ve collected for 30 years called The List of the Last Great Quiet Places. At last count, here in the United States, there were only 12. None of them are protected. I want to talk about the language of silence and sound, natural silence. You sometimes use it when you talk about these very few places\u2026 Natural silence, natural quiet. \u2026quiet places where natural silence reigns over many miles. And as you said a minute ago \u2014 you say this a lot \u2014 it\u2019s not absence. It\u2019s not a vacuum or an emptiness. This kind of silence is presence and it includes sound, right? Oh, yeah. It\u2019s not the absence of sound. I think a physicist will tell you that true silence does not exist, not on planet Earth with an atmosphere and oceans. When I speak of silence, I often use it synonymously with quiet. I mean silence from modern life, silence from all these sounds that have nothing to do with the natural acoustic system, which is busy communicating. Wildlife are as busy communicating as we are, but it\u2019s not just messages coming from wildlife. I can name some that have been really transformative in my personal life. But it\u2019s also the experience of place, what it means to be in a place. I kept thinking when I was reading you about a conversation I had with a physicist at one point who\u2019d been really influenced by Goethe, who talked about some things that physicists talk about, but from the perspective of a poet and learning, remembering that light \u2014 that in fact we don\u2019t see light except in terms of what it falls on. I was thinking about the way you talk about silence is that it\u2019s always something that\u2019s defined by the quality of silence as relevant to the sounds that are around it and against it. Oh, very much so. I\u2019m in the process of going through and cataloguing 30 years of work, having circled the globe three times collecting these experiences of silences. I have two folders in particular beyond all those other folders that are labeled insects, birds, frogs, forests, deserts, stuff like that. And sometimes you do wind, right, I mean, you do, sounds that we almost don\u2019t think of as sounds, grass waving. Yeah. Oh, grass wind. Oh, that is absolutely gorgeous, grass wind and pine wind. We can go back to the writing of John Muir, which he turned me on to the fact that the tone, the pitch, of the wind is a function of the length of the needle or the blade of grass. So the shorter the needle on the pine, the higher the pitch; the longer, the lower the pitch. There are all kinds of things like that, but the two folders where I collected, I have, oh, over 100 different recordings which are actually silent from places, and you cannot discern a sense of space, but you can discern a sense of tonal quality, that there is a fundamental frequency for each habitat. And then my quiet folder is a folder which is a step above that where you cannot distinguish any activity. You can\u2019t hear a bird, a cricket, you can\u2019t hear a ripple on a lake, you can\u2019t hear any of the wind going through the pines. But you do have a sense of space and each habitat also has a characteristic sense of space. These are the fundamental \u2014 to relate this to music, these are the fundamental tones that everything else is built up upon so that, when we listen to a place on planet Earth, we very quickly realize that Earth is a solar-powered jukebox. Right. I love that. I love that sentence. Yeah, it\u2019s a solar-powered jukebox. We can go to the equator, listen to the Amazon, where we have maximum sunlight, maximum solar energy. The solar panels, the leaves, are harvesting that and cycling it into the bioacoustic system. And, to my ears, that\u2019s a little too intense. That\u2019s a little bit too much action. Then we can jump up into Central America, and we can still feel and hear the intense solar energy, but it\u2019s beginning to wane. And we notice a really big difference when we start getting into the temperate latitudes, of which I particularly enjoy recording in because it\u2019s not just about the sound, but it\u2019s about something that I call the \u201Cpoetics\u201D of space. So say some more about that. Yeah. Silence is really wonderful, isn\u2019t it, Krista? It is. Even when we just let it exist \u2014 let it exist \u2014 it feeds our soul. I remember having a conversation once with a rabbi who works with the spirituality of children. She was talking about really practical things parents can do to nurture their children\u2019s inner lives. One of them was, she said, just create silence. Create spaces and times of silence because she \u2014 we may have called it an endangered species. It\u2019s something you have to actively make happen in a modern family life, right? I get so many comments when I give presentations and lectures of people that come up to me afterwards, and they say, \u201CYou know, my child just doesn\u2019t listen.\u201D We\u2019re all born listeners. And I always say, if there\u2019s one thing you want to do as an adult to become a better listener, take a preschooler, someone who hasn\u2019t gone to school and been taught how to listen by focusing attention, which is actually controlled impairment, but a preschooler who\u2019s still taking in the whole world. Hoist them onto your shoulders and go for a night walk. They\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know about becoming a better listener. And if you have the good fortune of going for a walk up a nature trail with a child, the younger they are, the more pointless it seems to go any further because the miracles are right here. Let\u2019s just sit down, don\u2019t worry about the exercise or the goals\u2026 The endpoint. \u2026the expectations that you brought into the experience, and let\u2019s just really be here. That is often the big challenge for adults when it comes to silence, because we\u2019re so busy being someplace else that when we\u2019re in a silent place, there are no distractions. We finally do get to meet ourselves and that can be frightening. For a short while, it can be frightening. It\u2019s practically fear of the unknown. Well, I\u2019m just thinking back to a couple of minutes ago where you were quiet. The truth is, there\u2019s something scary about it, and it is that thing of you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next and we\u2019re kind of trained to fill the void where we meet one. Yeah. Anything can happen. It\u2019s like the blank page to a writer. I take a moment of silence every day in my life that I don\u2019t try to fill with thoughts, that I turn everything off and sometimes that even means going over to the master breaker switch on the wall and clicking that. I know that other people might have other ways of saying it, but that\u2019s what sounds right to me. There\u2019s no purpose, but there\u2019s a great deal of joy. I\u2019m then able to go out into the day. A few minutes ago, Gordon Hempton led us on a hike with his ears through the Hoh Rain Forest \u2014 the Winter Wren; the Roosevelt elk. Take that hike again \u2014 and I\u2019d encourage you to listen if you can with headphones or earbuds. There\u2019s a whole other layer of experience you may have missed the first time.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CThe Last Quiet Places,\u201D with audio ecologist Gordon Hempton. He\u2019s a global explorer and collector of natural sound. He\u2019s recorded the soundscapes of prairies, shorelines, mountains, and forests around the world. In recent years, he\u2019s become a silence activist. He defines silence not as an absence but a presence. A quiet place, he says, is \u201Cthe think tank of the soul.\u201D I want to then kind of trace the silence back to the sound. OK. Because you do distinguish, right, we talked about silence is not an absence of sound, it\u2019s an absence of noise and that there\u2019s a lot of noise that we create \u2014 people create. But what I want to ask you, though, too is, as creatures among other creatures, what sounds of ours are part of the soundscape? You used this phrase, the natural acoustic system, right? I mean, surely much of what we do is also natural acoustics. Oh, yes. And it interests me when I read \u2014 when I looked at this documentary about \u2014 you love the sound of trains. Well, trains are inventions. They\u2019re mechanical objects. So why\u2026? I get criticized about that from people who don\u2019t like trains, but you know what I say? I don\u2019t have to argue about the contradictions in my life. I just know that I love trains, particularly steam engines, OK? And the whistles. Yeah, and the whistles. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t also love silence. But tell me what the difference is. I\u2019m saying, intuitively, I\u2019m with you, and I think a lot of people love the sound of trains, but what is the difference between a train and the sound of a car or the hum of an electric generator? Oh, tremendous. Well, the difference is the message, OK? A train, first of all, steam trains, the engineer when he uses that horn, the whistle with the pull thing, he\u2019s applying his own artistic sense, his own signature. His sense of timing. He is performing, OK? Then as the train backs up, you hear the exertion, the force. It\u2019s going over the clicking of the rails. It tells you the age of the tracks. But most of all, when I listen to trains and their whistles from miles away, it\u2019s like a whale letting out a sonar beep, and the whole topography of the surrounding landscape is revealed to me and the many layers of the echo that come towards me. And I know exactly where I am. There\u2019s that place again, that sense of place. There\u2019s that place. You know, listening is not about sound. Don\u2019t listen. If you ever find yourself listening for a sound, that\u2019s diagnostically a controlled impairment, all right? Simply listen to the place. And when you listen to the place, you take it all in, which is exactly what we\u2019re meant to do. So where does music figure in to your \u2014 this sensibility of yours? Well, I hear music coming from everywhere, and what I call music is basically defined as this: while I\u2019m listening to it, do I want to dance? And when it\u2019s over, do I find myself kind of, like, humming it? Has it affected it? Myself, have I internalized it? Am I now living out those dance steps just in the way I interact with people or carry myself down the path? And I hear music coming from the land. Some of the most sublime symphonies have been hidden away in something as simple as a driftwood log, and I\u2019d like to share with you the sound of the most musical beach in the world, to my ears. It\u2019s called Rialto Beach. We\u2019re about to enter into a giant driftwood log. It\u2019s a Sitka spruce log, the same material that\u2019s used in the crafting of violins, and it has a special property where that, when the wood fibers are excited by acoustic energy \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s the sound of the ocean itself \u2014 that the fibers actually vibrate. And inside, we get to listen to nature\u2019s largest violin. So, obviously, there\u2019s music, and there\u2019s music. I get that. But when we\u2026 That\u2019s a discussion we\u2019re not going to resolve here. No, we aren\u2019t going there. When we human beings, when we put on music in the background of life, as a soundtrack to a place or a time or an experience, maybe sometimes are we not just recreating what happens in nature where the birds are singing, and the grass is blowing, and there\u2019s that\u2026 Oh, absolutely. I hear all the time, in folk music in particular \u2014 and I\u2019ve been recording in Sri Lanka, for example. I spent a couple of weeks just recording the remote places there and the beautiful music that comes through the night, all the insects and frogs weaving deep textures. And then I listen to the folk music, and I hear the same thing all over again. Our music is just a reflection of who we are, and who we are is what we hear. So I hear a lot of modern music as being the urban environment, the noise just being transformed. Mm-hmm. But I want to ask you this question positively too. I think \u2014 my children challenge me also beyond my sense of what is good. I mean, I see my son reciting rap music that\u2019s just not something I would ever know what to do with. And as he is working with it, I see it as poetry that goes all the way through his body. I just wonder if you \u2014 if your children or just your experiences as you grow older, if there are insights that are new to you as you continue to listen even to our culture. Well, children of all ages and adults too make their choices based on their experience to a much less degree than what they\u2019re told. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever that we do take those backpacking trips into wilderness areas, that we do allow them to get to that \u2014 through that first one or two days of sheer boredom and then they make that adjustment. They feel their body coming into tune, that ringing of the ears ceases to exist. They meet in unexpected wildlife just right there on their shoulder practically, right? They notice things at night. They overcome how there are no streetlights, and things really do get dark and spooky at night, and how they wake up safely, and that there is a grander experience in nature. But most of all, their thoughts will empty out too. And they\u2019ll have that in their experience. So both my kids, they listen to rap music, and I don\u2019t restrict what they listen to or how they behave, but I do bring them along into the wilderness so they have that to compare it to. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, with acoustic ecologist and silence activist Gordon Hempton. You make some pretty stunning statements in your writing, just to take this a little bit farther, that research shows that in noisy areas people are less likely to help each other. Yes. And how do you explain that? The explanation really goes all the way to silence. When we can speak in silence, you can hear, not just my words, but you can hear my tone, what I mean even beyond the words. In fact, it\u2019s really not the words that are important. It\u2019s the tone. It\u2019s the overall message, the context. When we\u2019re in a noisy place in urban environments, we become isolated, and we exhibit antisocial behavior because we are cut off from a level of intimacy with each other and we\u2019re less in touch. We\u2019re busy not listening to this, not seeing that, not doing that. We aren\u2019t opening up and being where we are. I think this is really interesting, what you\u2019re pointing at again, that intimacy is also related to being able to listen even at a very primal level, not that \u2014 not even that we\u2019re in conversation, but that we can hear, that we are listening creatures and that that somehow is destroyed or interfered with in a very, very noisy environment. Listening for all animal life, at least higher vertebrates, listening is our sense of security. And when we\u2019re in a relatively quiet place, we can hear that all the information is in. So quiet places generally tend to be secure places. So they calm us, they calm our nervous systems. They calm us. We know all the information is in, the information isn\u2019t being jammed. This happens in nature when a deer, for example, has to drink out of a creek and then the noise of the creek blocks its ability to make surveillance, so it tries to compensate quickly with glances with its eyes, and then it drinks and then it moves back into a quiet place so it can continue to be secure. Isn\u2019t it amazing that our concert halls, our churches, places like that, they\u2019re quiet places? They\u2019re places where we can feel secure, secure enough that we can open up and be receptive and truly listen. And when we\u2019re truly listening, we also have to anticipate that we might become changed by what we have heard. This is such an important point you make as a professional listener, and it\u2019s something I know too, that real listening is about being vulnerable. Yes. Right, and but \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t even know that I know how to explain it. I mean, how do you explain that? Well, when you really listen, when you really keep your mind open and listening to another person \u2014 and by the way, I highly recommend that if a person wants to increase their ability to understand another person, that they start out listening to nature because you\u2019re totally uninvested in the outcome of nature. You can just take it all in, all the expressions. And isn\u2019t it wonderful that, when a bird sings, that we do hear it as music? The bird doesn\u2019t sing for our benefit. So there\u2019s a lot of joy in that listening, and when we become better listeners to nature, we also become better listeners to each other, so that when another person is speaking with you, you don\u2019t have to search for what you want them to say. You can dare to risk what they really are trying to say. And ask them too, \u201CIs this really what you\u2019re saying?\u201D And feel your own emotional response as they talk about risky subjects like how it is being a parent in the world that it is today. So I actually think there\u2019s something building here in the culture at large. There was an article in The New York Times by Pico Iyer, who\u2019s\u2026 Oh, yes. Did you see that? \u201CThe Joy of Quiet.\u201D Yes. He\u2019s a journalist, a writer of books, an intellectual. And it was just the latest thing I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s not the only thing. But it was about people leading very modern lives. He gave a bunch of examples. It ends with him running into \u2014 he goes to a monastery, and he runs into somebody who works at MTV who brings his kids to this quiet place. And he ends it by saying \u2014 Pico Iyer ends it by saying, \u201CThe child of tomorrow, I realized, may actually be ahead of us in terms of sensing not what\u2019s new, but what\u2019s essential.\u201D And he\u2019s talking about quiet. And quiet is the element of \u2014 just like what you said \u2014 of discerning what is essential. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting to be alive today is because we are making these choices rather than living a life of assumptions where quiet is not important. Not too long ago, it was assumed that, \u201COh, clean water is not important.\u201D But now it is, and we\u2019re cleaning that up. That, \u201COh, seeing the stars is not that important.\u201D And now I think we\u2019re realizing quiet is important, and we need silence; that silence is not a luxury, but it\u2019s essential. It\u2019s essential to our quality of life and being able just to think straight. This also makes me think about something that I trace, which is how our ancient spiritual traditions gain a new kind of relevance, parts of them do in this ultramodern world, because, also, I mean, Pico Iyer went to a monastery. I mean, there are \u2014 religious spaces are some of those last places that are reserved for quiet, and it\u2019s been very counter-cultural but may be less so again. I don\u2019t know. Mm-hmm. Well, recently it\u2019s been discovered that cave paintings in France, for example, that show the staggered images of bison and other animals of the hunt, that those paintings occur in acoustically unique environments within the cave. And it\u2019s believed that, by listening and listening to their echoes, that it was possible to commune with the spiritual world. Interesting. But you have brought up something really important to me and that is about our ancient past. When I go to a quiet place, I get to challenge assumptions. And one of the major assumptions is that the human ear is tuned to hear the human voice. If that were true, that\u2019s an assumption that audiologists, scientists who study human hearing, have believed for a long time, that our ears evolved to hear the human voice. Right. But if\u2026 Yeah, I know. But if that were true, we\u2019d be the first species on planet Earth to have evolved so separate and protected from the rest of nature. So my natural curiosity was to look at the range of human hearing and these equal-loudness contours. And we have a very discreet bandwidth of super-sensitive hearing, and that\u2019s between 2.5 and 5 kilohertz in the resident frequencies of the auditory canal. Is there something in our ancestors\u2019 environment that matches our peak hearing human sensitivity? Because most of what I\u2019m saying right now, except for the \u201Cs\u201D sounds and the high-pitched sounds, falls well below that range. And indeed, there\u2019s a perfect match: birdsong. Birdsong. Why would it have any benefit to our ancestors to be able to hear faint birdsong? Why would our ears possibly have evolved so that we could walk in the direction of faint birdsong? Birdsong is the primary indicator of habitats prosperous to humans. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Now when you\u2019re in a quiet place, what is the listening horizon? If you ask a person that lives in a city, they might take a wild guess and say, \u201COh, you can listen for a mile.\u201D Right? They know it\u2019s a trick question, so they\u2019re going to pick something really big. \u201CYou can listen for a mile.\u201D You ask somebody in the country? \u201COh, you can listen for three or four miles.\u201D And I\u2019ve heard sounds 20 miles away. If you do the math, that is the size of 1,276 square miles. Do you know what it\u2019s like to listen to 1,276 square miles when the sun is rising? Gordon Hempton is founder and vice president of The One Square Inch of Silence Foundation, based in Joyce, Washington. His books include One Square Inch of Silence: One Man\u2019s Quest to Preserve Quiet, co-authored with John Grossmann, and Earth Is A Solar Powered Jukebox: A Complete Guide to Listening, Recording, and Sound Designing with Nature. He\u2019s also produced more than 60 albums of vanishing natural soundscapes. And shortly after our original conversation in 2012, Gordon Hempton let us know that he experienced a dramatic loss in hearing. He has made a move from suburban Seattle to the rugged wilderness of the North Olympic Peninsula, and he says that living in a tent, hauling water, and chopping wood have been as effective as modern medicine. Though he continues to struggle with his hearing, he was able to release his 17th Quiet Planet collection \u2014 a compilation of recordings from Hawaii."
