  "fullText": "This presidential contest has surfaced a need to reimagine common life and common good. In this second part of the Danforth Dialogues, we take a long view of how to live beyond this election, with the wisdom of the former U.S. poet laureate Natasha Trethewey and interfaith visionary Eboo Patel. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. We were convened by the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis the day before the town hall presidential debate. I\u2019m really honored to be here today. I want to acknowledge that we find ourselves in a strange, tumultuous political moment. And in the conversations today, we\u2019re not going to focus on what happened yesterday or today or what trended in the last 20 minutes, but on the challenge and promise into which we will all be living as citizens with our political culture and our society, whoever wins the election on November 8. These are two very different leaders here with me today. So this is going to be interesting and fun. And thinking about religion and the common good, that as the theme of this conversation, as I delved into the two of you, I started thinking that this is really more about religion and the art and science of the common good. \u201CThe science of the interfaith triangle\u201D is the kind of language that Eboo Patel uses to describe some of what he works with and the project that he founded and leads, the Interfaith Youth Core, which Robert Putnam has called \u201Cthe most successful interfaith movement in the U.S.\u201D And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s right. Natasha Trethewey is not a religious figure, but she is one of our foremost poets, a Pulitzer Prize winner, a former poet laureate of the United States, and she works in a medium which she has described as a corrective to the trivialized corrosive language of public life in our time. Natasha is also a child of two parents of different races. Eboo is a child of immigrants. And so they also each embody an experience and an intelligence about some of our most fraught human places that are haunting and shaping our political life right now. And I want to just ask you both briefly as we start if you would just trace the beginnings, the roots in your life of what the connection between religion and common life might be. And Eboo, I wonder if you would start with that. Sure. It\u2019s fun to be back on a college campus because so many of my changes happened in college. I say to students all the time \u2014 there\u2019s a great line by the French writer Marcel Proust that the true journey of discovery is not in finding new landscapes; it\u2019s in developing new eyes. And it\u2019s on a college campus that I developed new eyes. And first, it was eyes of anger around race, identity, diversity issues. I was an anger-fueled activist. And I came very, very close to the edge of burnout. Until one day, somebody said to me, \u201CHave you ever heard of Dorothy Day?\u201D And I found in Dorothy Day this most luminous, simple, cosmic language of justice, which was basically, if you are a Christian, you ought to live the way Christ lived. And it turned out that there was a house of hospitality, a Catholic worker house, in Champaign Urbana where I went to school. And I went there one Sunday evening. And it was qualitatively different than any other social service agency I\u2019d even been in. It wasn\u2019t an agency; it was a community. And the thing that struck me most, I think, about Dorothy Day and her work was she wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with herself. She felt like, if you see yourself as a Christian, this is what you do. And of course, I\u2019m not a Christian. I\u2019m a Muslim. Right. And did that encounter with Dorothy Day and her approach to faith \u2014 that was also kind of a path for you back into grappling with where that notion of service lies in your Islamic identity. It was my first step on kind of a larger interfaith spiritual journey. And of course, the one that I got to last was Islam. Right. I\u2019ll finish the story off by saying \u2014 I go to India in the summer of 1998. This is four years after I\u2019ve heard of Dorothy Day. And I wake up one day, and there\u2019s a woman in my grandmother\u2019s home who doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s part of the family, extended family, or part of the household help. And I say to my grandmother, \u201CMama, who is this woman?\u201D And my grandmother says, \u201CWell, we don\u2019t know her real name. Her father and uncle are abusing her, so we\u2019ve taken her in. The leader of the local Muslim prayer house has brought her here.\u201D And my grandmother padded over to the cupboard, and she brought a shoebox. And she opened it up, and there were dozens and dozens of Polaroids, pictures of all of these women over the swath of India, over the course of 50 years that she had brought into her home. And I\u2019m going through these Polaroids, and she\u2019d written on the back, \u201CHelped this one get her teeth fixed.\u201D \u201CHelped this one go to beauty school.\u201D \u201CHelped this one get a marriage.\u201D \u201CThis one owns a cake shop in Hyderabad.\u201D I\u2019m looking through all of these, and I\u2019m like, \u201CMama, why do you do this?\u201D And she\u2019s like, \u201CI\u2019m a Muslim. This is what we do.\u201D And it was this kind of same Dorothy-Day sense of \u2014 you see the light on the path, and you walk the path, and you\u2019re not especially impressed with yourself. And I still, to this day, understand that as the heart of the religious ethic. Natasha, religion and the common good. Well, I suppose that it begins, for me, because I\u2019m a poet, in language itself. And it took me a long time to realize that, to realize that I was making the connections between our language, the language of poetry, religion, and the common good. It happened when I was working on a book of mine called Beyond Katrina. It\u2019s a meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. 2012. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a beautiful book. Thank you. It\u2019s, of course, about the aftermath of the hurricane on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and my family history and connection to it. And as I was writing the book \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen this in my poems too \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t until writing that book that I saw how much of the language that comes to me is the language of religion, the language of religious rites. And that struck me as odd because I \u2014 though I was raised in the Baptist church, I think of myself as a secular humanist. And so what I discovered is that when a word like the word \u201Cliturgy\u201D comes to me, a word that, of course, connects us to the various ceremonies that would take place in various faiths, that in the original Greek, the word simply meant one\u2019s public duty undertaken as a citizen in service to the state. So, the idea of \u201Cin service to the common good\u201D comes from something secular, but it is also deeply connected to something that we do in our faith. And so, from there, I began to think about all those different words that arise sort of unbidden because, I suppose, of my own training and my own thinking about language. Even my name, Natasha, shares the prefix with words like \u201Cnatal,\u201D \u201Cnativity,\u201D and \u201Cnational.\u201D They go together. Mm. Yes, I think you have chapters in that book and poems with titles like \u201CWitness\u201D and \u2014 is \u201CCommunion\u201D one of them? \u201CProdigal.\u201D All of those titles. There\u2019s \u201CExegesis.\u201D All of those titles are about ways of thinking, both the connection to religion, but also that secular part that has a lot to do with what Eboo said, and that is about justice. It seemed to me that the language of poetry and what I\u2019m interested in, like the language of religion, is about justice, empathy, bearing witness. So a hallmark of our current political moment and our cultural moment is the race conversation, that I think we mostly talk about the race conversation when we talk about how we don\u2019t know how to talk about it. But we know our need of it. It was interesting to be thinking about the two of you and also to be reflecting on how each of you, in your own way, has a stake in that, but also embodies the reality that the very meaning of race is evolving so rapidly even as we seek to grapple with it more fully. So Natasha, you\u2019ve said that you describe yourself, as you believe President Obama does, as both black and biracial. And when your African-American mother married your white father, they were breaking the law, the law of Mississippi where they lived in 1965, and worried that you would be despised in parts of society. Mm-hmm. And I know you\u2019ve reflected on that a lot in this era in which we have had a black and biracial president. Yes, it is one of those things that, sadly, is ongoing for us, as you say. My parents got married in 1965 and had to go to Ohio to do so. And this was two years before the Loving Decision. And so it was illegal, not only in Mississippi, but in 20 other states in the nation. The Loving Decision was the couple who finally overturned the law. That\u2019s right. The Lovings in Virginia. And their name happened to be Loving, which is so amazing. Loving, which I love. Yes. You can\u2019t beat that. You can\u2019t. But I\u2019ve often talked about this, that sometimes the worst things seem to disappear, but really, they just get buried. And so, in the late \u201890s in the state of Alabama, that\u2019s the time that they finally put to a vote of the people whether or not the anti-miscegenation statute should be removed from the Constitution. And even though it finally was, 42 percent of the voting population in the state voted that it should remain so that at least it could be said symbolically that parents like mine shouldn\u2019t be able to marry legally or people like me be born legally. That wasn\u2019t very long ago. And it hasn\u2019t all been resolved because we had a biracial president. No. No, in many ways, some of the worst things that seemed to have gone underground have resurfaced. Eboo, it was interesting for me to read that, when you had your children, who are here today, these lovely young gentlemen\u2026 Pay attention, Zayd. \u2026that your mother worried that you hadn\u2019t given them American names, which I \u2014 was that code for them having the names that sounded foreign, even Muslim? Right. Now, Zayd and Khalil are beautiful Muslim-American names. But this was \u2014 Khalil was born in 2010. Three months later, we had this absolute circus madness around Cordoba House, otherwise known as the Ground Zero Mosque. And it was the first time in my mother\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, 40 years in America that she\u2019s been afraid of praying in Arabic, saying \u201CBismillah\u201D in restaurants, having grandsons with Muslim-sounding names. Yeah. You and I had a really interesting \u2014 you and I met just \u2014 we had dinner a couple months ago, and you shared your reaction to the kind of toxic language and sentiment around Muslims that\u2019s surfaced up in parts of this campaign. What I was struck by is the real compassion that you were bringing to that human pain and fear that express themselves as anger. And I wonder if you\u2019d just talk to us a little bit about that. So, I guess there\u2019s a couple parts of this, right? So number one, part of what this election has done for me is to open the curtain on 50% of America that I haven\u2019t thought much about. That makes me a bad citizen. That doesn\u2019t mean the way that a swath of my fellow citizens is expressing their understanding of their life circumstance is healthy. But to recognize that I hadn\u2019t thought about huge swaths of this country is on me. And I think about this a lot, actually. So, what if somebody were to come up to me and tap me on the shoulder one day and say, \u201CHey, man. All of your facility in language, your ability to strategically plan, give talks, facilitate meetings, that economy is gone. Sorry.\u201D And so, what if you\u2019re coming up at a certain time in history, and the story is, \u201CLook, if you graduate high school, you play football, you don\u2019t commit a felony, you\u2019ve got a job right over there. And here are the four steps on the ladder of that job. And you keep your nose clean and play well, by your mid 50s, here\u2019s the role you\u2019ll be in.\u201D And then, \u201Cpoof!\u201D That\u2019s gone. And it\u2019s gone for your children too. And it\u2019s gone for your children. I had spent zero time thinking about that circumstance until about 18 months ago. I\u2019m a huge Springsteen fan. I think I just saw him on the River Tour. \u201CI got Mary pregnant. And man that was all she wrote. And for my 18th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat.\u201D In 1980, that was written as a lament. Now it\u2019s a dream, right? It\u2019s an unachievable dream for many\u2026 It\u2019s an unachievable \u2014 and how can I not feel for that? And how can I not recognize that, although my name is a little weird, and my color attracts double looks in some places, that I\u2019m at the center of the culture? And that\u2019s a lot of luck. And to cultivate some sort of empathy for people who were once at the center of the culture and aren\u2019t anymore, I feel like that\u2019s a part of the gift that poetry has given me. And that\u2019s part of the requirements of American citizenship. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with interfaith activist Eboo Patel and poet Natasha Trethewey. Natasha, I\u2019m curious about how you think about that. And you said \u2014 and maybe I should invite you to draw that out some more \u2014 that there\u2019s this paradoxical sense, but maybe we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Maybe it\u2019s the way human beings are, that on the one hand, we achieved this sign of progress, of racial progress, but it\u2019s also surfaced \u2014 or at least it\u2019s been part of surfacing \u2014 a lot of terrible amount of unfinished work. So say some more about how you see that, but also how you think about this dynamic Eboo is describing. Well, I\u2019m glad you made the point again about poetry because I find that maybe I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the various populations across the country because poetry is a thing that asks us to do that. It asks us always to learn something about ourselves through the intimate, unique experience of another, the voice speaking to us in a poem. And those voices are often people who are very different from us. What I think about as I think about the people who are frustrated about their opportunities, where their lives are going, what seems to have been lost, is that we\u2019re a nation in which, for the longest time, so much of being able to be in a position where you had all those things depended on keeping other people from having them. And that\u2019s the sad thing about it, that we can be both empathetic to people who feel like they are losing something, but part of what they are losing is the fact that other people are gaining equal opportunity and equal rights. And lest it seems that we have strayed from the topic of religion and the common good, I think we\u2019re right in the middle of it. I think Senator Danforth, in all his career, as he\u2019s talked about what it means to bring your whole self as a person of faith into the political sphere, has to do with how we wield the love commandment. However imperfectly, we will always live according to it. And so, one way to talk about this is we have not loved others. We have not kept children safe, which is the primary thing that love does. And to that point, Eboo, compassion is absolutely at the heart of every single one of our traditions. One of the things I think you also started to realize as a teenager and a student is that, while you and your fellow \u2014 your peers in a Chicago \u2014 was it a suburban high school? Mm-hmm. Were very articulate about all of the different aspects of your identity, racial, ethnic, gender, these same people had an impoverished vocabulary about religious identity. And an implication of that is \u2014 obviously, we have that impoverished vocabulary and an impoverished ability to carry it into our lives. That is going to inhibit whether something like compassion can manifest in common life. So, I wonder as you \u2014 how have you experienced, in this work you\u2019ve done of equipping young people with that vocabulary, how does that nuance expand the way they are present to these challenges of our time, of otherness, of doing something more than just tolerating otherness? So, the way I think about it now is, for me, the large frame question is, what does it mean to nurture a healthy religiously diverse democracy? And if I think about each of those terms \u2014 what\u2019s a democracy? It\u2019s not just a place where you elect your representatives. A democracy is a place where you can make personal convictions public. You can make them public in politics, you can make them public in civil society, et cetera. Right? Diversity is not just the differences you like; diversity is the differences you don\u2019t like. Right. Diversity is the disagreements, right? And actually, I think that\u2019s something \u2014 as much as we celebrated diversity and had this virtue of tolerance after the \u201860s, that piece we\u2019re just now learning, right? Oh, well, I mean, everywhere in my kids\u2019 elementary school \u2014 \u201Cmulticulturalism is our strength and diversity is beautiful\u201D stuff. And I\u2019m like, \u201COh, yeah.\u201D Well, that\u2019s the egg rolls and samosas version of diversity, right? Right. That\u2019s the \u2014 everything tastes good. And look, it\u2019s \u2014 you ought to get that when you\u2019re 8. And we didn\u2019t have that when I was a kid. And the samosas that my mother packed in my lunch, I would look at them \u2014 I\u2019m like, \u201CMom, first you name me Eboo\u2026\u201D \u201CAnd now you\u2019re going to put this \u2014 do you know what happens to me at school when you do this?\u201D So, it is a step forward. Yeah. It\u2019s a baby step. It\u2019s a big step. Yeah. So, if you add religion to a diverse democracy, and if you understand religion per Tillich as \u201Cultimate concerns,\u201D you have a society in which people are invited to make their personal convictions on matters of ultimate concern public, knowing that their neighbor has a different definition of \u201Cjustice\u201D than they do. Justice is another term that we assume everybody has the same definition of. My new line to 20-year-olds who look very chastised when I say this on campuses is, \u201CIf everybody in the room that you\u2019re in has the same definition of \u2018justice\u2019 that you do \u2014 I don\u2019t care how many colors, or genders, or sexual preferences, or religions are in that room \u2014 it\u2019s not a diverse room.\u201D Part of the definition of \u201Cdiversity\u201D is the recognition there are diverse understandings of justice. So, in that situation, what does healthy look like? And my quick take on that is healthy is a society in which people who orient around religion differently can disagree on some fundamental things and work together on other fundamental things. And in my mind, the most dangerous trend in our society right now is what Andrew Sullivan calls the \u201Cscalping\u201D trend, which is if you disagree with me on one fundamental thing \u2014 and I\u2019m going to recognize that these things are fundamental \u2014 matters of the Middle East, same sex marriage, abortion \u2014 they are fundamental \u2014 let\u2019s not say that they\u2019re marginal at all \u2014 but if you disagree with me on that, I will neutralize our entire relationship, and I will take your scalp and hang it on my wall as a trophy to make sure that everybody else who has that opinion knows that I\u2019m coming for them. And I just \u2014 how do you have a society in which people who disagree on where to draw the line in the Middle East will perform heart surgery together, or serve on the PTA together? Isn\u2019t that what a diverse democracy is? And it feels to me like the central thing that we do is nurture that ethic of a half-full cup of, \u201CI will disagree with you on this set of things and continue to work with you on this other set of things.\u201D We each brought our own little\u2026. That\u2019s right. And I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear how you think about \u2014 I mean, this is such an important critique of how we interact with each other, but also about how we use language. And you must be watching that as well. And I wonder how you watch that with your perspective as a poet. Well, you\u2019re going to watch me think through this one. Good. That\u2019s what we like. I was thinking that what Eboo was saying was exactly right. But for a moment, I longed to be standing in front of my OED with my little magnifying glass so that I could look up that word \u201Cjustice\u201D again. Because there is a part of me, I suppose, that wants to believe that there is a kind of justice that could treat everyone right. That could treat everyone equally the way that they deserve. But the idea that words that I believe so much in \u2014 I believe so much in the power of words \u2014 that somehow could get twisted or changed or applied in all sorts of troubling ways. It\u2019s going to sound like I\u2019m going back to this, but this is the example that I think of as I think about the word \u201Cjustice.\u201D It goes back to that word \u201Cempathy.\u201D And hearing a few years ago, many people, after listening to the president call on us as citizens to empathize with other people, there were actually people who said they did not want to empathize. And I think that that\u2019s the thing that seems to separate us from the animals. And people did \u2014 although my dog seems to empathize with me. At least I think she is. But seriously \u2014 that we wouldn\u2019t want to do that. It just made me think, \u201CWell, that\u2019s really horrible. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to do that?\u201D It never occurred to me to think that whatever they think \u201Cempathizing\u201D means is something they wouldn\u2019t want to do, just as we might think of the word \u201Cjustice\u201D as a different thing. I wonder if \u201Cwant\u201D is the right word, you know? I mean, I interviewed a couple of months ago the Civil Rights leader and veteran Ruby Sales. We talked about what she sees as a spiritual crisis of white America, which kind of comes back to what we were talking about a minute ago. And I think that the empathy she mustered was that people are so afraid, and so beaten down, and so \u2014 and this is not just white people \u2014 and so fearful that I think \u2014 some of the things we\u2019re learning on our scientific frontier is that our brains won\u2019t go \u2014 that we have to create conditions for empathy and compassion to feel safe for each other, much as \u2014 you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a terrible thought that we have to \u2014 right? That it\u2019s not just natural and intuitive. Right. But it\u2019s not \u2014 and I think instinctive. It\u2019s not always even biologically instinctive. One of the ways my life changed in college was William Raspberry who wrote for the Washington Post. So, when I was 19 or 20 \u2014 and I was a fire-breathing dragon at this time. You couldn\u2019t come within 50 feet of me without getting long lectures on people of color, consciousness, and socialism. My dad damned near kicked me out of the house at one point. He said to me, \u201CIf you give me one more lecture being bourgeois, you can find some other bourgeois dad to pay your bourgeois college tuition.\u201D William Raspberry writes a column in which he says, \u201CThe smartest people I know secretly believe both sides of the issue.\u201D And that was so striking to me. Because I was \u2014 the way I viewed the world at that point was, \u201CI\u2019m the smart one. You all are the dumb ones. My job is to figure out how to make you smart.\u201D And the definition of \u201Csmart\u201D was you thought like me. Or how to make you see things my way, which is smart. Yeah, exactly, right? And this notion of William Raspberry, who was, generally speaking, a progressive columnist was like \u2014 look, the smartest people I know choose the pro-life side and understand that there\u2019s something else at stake. The smartest people I know are against the death penalty and understand that people who might be in favor aren\u2019t crazy, that there\u2019s a set of values, something at stake there. I wanted to say one thing very briefly on this matter of justice. And I actually \u2014 my sense is actually justice and empathy, they\u2019re in the Venn diagram. There\u2019s a shaded area. But the more empathy one has and the more diversity one is in, the more one recognizes different definitions of justice. So, here\u2019s my moment to this. Eight or 10 years ago, I\u2019m speaking on a college campus, and I happened to be speaking with a man named Nechervan Barzani, who was introduced to me as an Iraqi leader And as a good multicultural against the Bush administration progressive, my first instinct was to apologize to him for, quote, \u201Cthe unjust war in Iraq.\u201D And he looks at me, and he kind of shakes his head. And I think his English isn\u2019t great, and so I repeat what I said. And I said\u2026 This is a great insight into the mind of the Manichean, right? You don\u2019t understand me because your English isn\u2019t great, not because you disagree with me. I said, \u201CI want to apologize on behalf of the American people.\u201D All 320 million \u2014 for the unjust war in Iraq. And he looked at me, and he said, \u201CI\u2019m a Kurd. The only unjust thing about the war in Iraq is you didn\u2019t do it 20 years ago.\u201D And I thought to myself, how ridiculous that I didn\u2019t even imagine that. And I mean, of course, this is over the next several years that I kind of unpacked this in my head. But how narrow a world did I live in that I thought that this was \u2014 now, I still believe the Iraq war was unjust, but I do I think that Nechirvan Barzani\u2019s position, after having tens, hundreds of thousands of his people killed by Saddam Hussein\u2019s chemical warfare, that his position is not a reasonable definition of justice? And what strikes me in reflection is, how come I didn\u2019t imagine that? How come I didn\u2019t play with the figure of Nechirvan Barzani in my mind in the dialogue? How is it that I had such a black and white vision of justice in the world? And I find that \u2014 I think that that is a problem in the hyper-diverse, 325-million jazz of a nation in which we live. In my mind, you don\u2019t have a diverse democracy, you don\u2019t have America, unless people are willing to say, \u201CI am able to disagree with you on this set of things, and you will see me on the other side of the picket line on those things. And I will try to defeat your candidate at the polls. And we will find other things to do together.\u201D You can listen again and share this conversation with Eboo Patel and Natasha Trethewey through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. We\u2019re exploring how to live \u2014 and to reweave \u2014 common life, beyond this election. I\u2019m with Pulitzer prize-winning, former U.S. poet laureate Natasha Trethewey and interfaith visionary and activist Eboo Patel. We were convened by the John C. Danforth Center for Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis, on the eve of the presidential debate on that campus. Natasha, I just want to read something you wrote that\u2019s very beautiful that I think speaks again about the art, the sacred language of poetry in this collective task. \u201CPoetry allows us to reckon with our troubled past and to imagine the better, more just society that we must continue each day to build. It evokes in us \u2018the better angels of our nature,\u2019 eliciting our most humane impulses to engage the humanity of others through the projection of our own emotional knowledge, our empathetic understanding \u2014 the best knowledge we have for dealing with each other. And deal with each other we must. I have faith in poetry\u2019s ability to help us do so, to wield its ennobling influence on us, and to save us \u2014 perhaps not as a nation, but one life at a time.\u201D The last two words of what you just read \u2014 that you didn\u2019t read \u2014 the last two were \u201Clike mine.\u201D Yeah. I know. I didn\u2019t read that. I\u2019m glad you added that. Because\u2026 One life at a time, like yours. Like mine. I remember listening to a minister at a funeral saying, \u201CDo not grieve as others grieve.\u201D And the message was about the solace that awaited us in heaven, in the afterlife. And I was deeply grieving. And it was almost a message to me that, somehow, because that wasn\u2019t my faith, that\u2019s why I was grieving, because I wasn\u2019t a believer and that there was nothing for me because of that. But I am a believer in something else. I am a believer in the human capacity for justice, the human capacity to do right, the human capacity to address and correct the wrongs of the past. One of the ways that we do it \u2014 the idea in Auden\u2019s poem is that poetry makes nothing happen, but of course, it makes so much happen. It\u2019s a way that we listen to each other when it is hard to listen to each other. As Eboo points out, it\u2019s hard to want to listen to diversity if diversity isn\u2019t the good stuff. It\u2019s the stuff that makes us different. But I think, also, it helps us to contend with what has been right and what has been wrong. And I think, to go back to this idea of justice, I try to get my head around the idea that there were people, for example \u2014 and this is an easy example, but I think you\u2019ll know what I mean \u2014 who believed that lynching was justice. Right. But that\u2019s extra-legal. That\u2019s outside the law. That\u2019s not justice. Not justice to me. Not justice, I imagine, to people sitting in this room too. So do we say the lynchers just had a different idea of justice? Or do we say the lynchers were wrong? And I think the other question is, how do we come into relationship with the lynchers? Or maybe not the lynchers but the people right around them who haven\u2019t quite made that move to violence. Well, I mean, I feel like we\u2019ve seen a lot of that \u2014 the Faith in Politics Institute and the pilgrimage that John Lewis takes this diverse group of people on every year. Right, where we first met a couple of years ago. Exactly. He believes, and a lot of people who share his belief is that \u2014 love. He believes that by loving the lynchers, you can bring them to love, you can bring them to justice. I\u2019d like to also bring them to knowledge. I\u2019d like them to be educated about the law, about the Constitution. But I think that the way you get them is to love them, to empathize with them. Right. It doesn\u2019t mean condoning anything. Right. And I also don\u2019t think it means love as this feeling. And it\u2019s not romantic. It\u2019s a form of love. It\u2019s empathy. It\u2019s a practical form of love. In fact, it\u2019s like the agape of the New Testaments. They should also go to jail. That too. They should go to jail too. I mean, you can do both. And that\u2019s justice. Yeah, right. Right. That\u2019s justice. So, I think we\u2019ve circled to this \u2014 to the big open question of how to live beyond this election. Right? What is our work now? And I\u2019m really much more concerned about November 9 and beyond that than I am about November 8. Because whatever happens, whoever wins, all of this turmoil is still going to be with us. And it\u2019s really a human drama, a human crisis that has fueled political events. I really think, for all that is so hard right now, part of the reason it\u2019s so hard is \u2014 we talked about the early days of just all being in the room, and being so proud of that, was a baby step of pluralism. And now we\u2019re getting into kind of \u2014 do we become mature, right? Do we get out of adolescence? And do we really figure out what this means to be \u2014 I remember the great Civil Rights leader Vincent Harding, who wrote King\u2019s Vietnam speech and helped create the philosophy of non-violence from the Mennonite Center in Atlanta, said to me, \u201CThis business of being a multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious democratic society, we\u2019ve only been doing this for 50 years. We are a developing nation at this.\u201D Which is not the way we think about ourselves, but that\u2019s really what we\u2019re describing here. What I loved about Vincent is he would open his speeches by saying, \u201CI live in a country that does not yet exist.\u201D And you could hear the possibility for cynicism, right? And like, go ahead and list the sins and mistakes. And instead, he spends the next 45 minutes willing that promise into existence, and I found that so inspiring. I think \u2014 we just celebrated in Chicago the commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u2014 the 50th anniversary of his fair housing march in Chicago. And it was an ugly moment in Chicago and American history. 700 peaceful marchers, 5,000 people from the community showing up to spit, throw bricks, hurl racial epithets. A brick hits King in the head, he goes down on one knee, blood drips. He gets back up, and he keeps marching. My family and I, we went to the 50th anniversary commemoration. And I\u2019m rereading Taylor Branch\u2019s chapter from that time. And Taylor Branch points out this moment that \u2014 so a couple days after King gets hit with the brick, they come and do the march again, of course, because that\u2019s what King did. And King breaks free from his security, and he goes to one of these ethnic whites on the sidewalk throwing bottles and spitting, and he says, \u201CYou are too smart and good looking to be so full of hate.\u201D I mean, I find that so remarkable. So not everybody is touched by God the way that King is, but the thing that I think about \u2014 when it comes to greatness like that is King knows that after the Civil Rights Act, after the election of a black president, after whatever it might be, he still has to live with that kid. You can\u2019t expel that kid from the nation. For every stitch of hate you put in the fabric, you have to unstitch and you have to restitch in a different way later, right? So King is getting ahead of that. Now, my line is far south of getting hit in the head with a brick, but I think that that points to something remarkable. That \u2014 do people change by getting yelled at? Or do people change by saying \u201CHey, man, I thought you were up here. Why don\u2019t you rise to that?\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with interfaith activist Eboo Patel and poet Natasha Trethewey. That idea of living in a country that no longer exists, or that does not yet exist, I think, gets at this notion of narrative. Like, the narrative, the story we tell our \u2014 it\u2019s not just what exists, what is real and what is not; it\u2019s what we privilege in the story we tell of our time, which I think does not call us to be our best selves or make that seem very possible. And I think, Natasha, this is so \u2014 I think this notion of narrative in your book Beyond Katrina, which you called a meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, the one that\u2019s full of liturgy, you talk about physical landscapes, and the landscape of cultural memory, and emotional knowledge that gets passed down and inherited and passed through families, and all these ways we know who we are. Eboo, something I\u2019m really aware of now is there\u2019s all this anti-Muslim sentiment that\u2019s just there again, right? I mean, it\u2019s never gone away since 9/11, but it\u2019s resurfaced. And yet, at the same time, since 9/11, all over this country, there are Muslims and Christians and other members of the community in relationships that \u2014 nobody had thought about doing that before. And that narrative is true as well as the frightening things we read in the newspaper. I don\u2019t know what my question is, but\u2026 This notion of narrative \u2014 and let\u2019s end on this \u2014 talk about your sense of how we can talk to ourselves about ourselves, and the importance of that, and the content of that moving beyond this election. Well, I was just thinking about two things. One, a line from Rumi, \u201CThe wound is the place where the light enters you.\u201D We are so deeply wounded right now that part of the story that we can begin to tell ourselves is that we are so fully open for light to enter us now because we are so deeply wounded. The stories are always different. The stories that we need to tell ourselves as individuals or as parts of groups often are in contention with each other. And yet, it has been my belief for a long time that, to tell a fuller version of American history, a fuller version of our stories as natives and immigrants of the United States, that all the stories have to be told \u2014 it\u2019s an aggregate of our narratives. And that in the aggregate, in knowing more about the stories that are often erased or buried or forgotten, we tell a fuller version of American history that\u2019s owned by all of us and, I think, can benefit all of us. There\u2019s no benefit for us to not know certain stories or to not tell each other certain stories. There is not a single story, but the aggregate of our stories. And in that kind of telling, we get toward a larger shared truth about the differences of our stories, but collective. A more whole story. Yeah. So, Eboo, religion, the common good, and the narratives we live by. I think that there are surface narratives, and there\u2019s a lot of ugliness at our surface right now. And I think that there are deeper narratives. And I\u2019m actually very hopeful about the long-term trajectory of things. I\u2019ll just take a Muslim example. In June, 2016, four or five months ago, Muhammad Ali, maybe the most prominent Muslim figure in American history, passes away. And he literally gets a state funeral. I mean, it\u2019s carried for two and a half hours on ESPN and CNN. Former presidents speak, et cetera, et cetera. And Muhammad Ali is celebrated for a range of things, but in part, he is celebrated for an Islamic conviction to not go to war. He refuses to go to the Vietnam War, he goes to the Supreme Court, and he wins his conscientious objector case based on being a Muslim. OK. He\u2019s celebrated, in part, for that. This is not hidden. Two months later, Khizr Khan upends the political race by saying that his son, Humayun Khan, dies as a captain in Iraq who gave his life for his company. And both of these figures are welcomed, if you will, as American-Muslim archetypes. And it seems \u2014 that\u2019s a deep narrative, right? I mean, I don\u2019t think that a lot of people are walking around with that hyper-salient, but\u2026 No, it\u2019s a whole different way to tell that story that\u2019s been told and retold. When a community \u2014 when people in a community are allowed to be complex like that, you can be celebrated for your courage, your Islamic courage, for not going to war, you can be celebrated for your Islamic courage for going to war. And it happens two months apart. And it\u2019s a lot of the same people celebrating both. It just means that this new community, like Catholics before, and Jews before, and Mormons before \u2014 frankly, all of us set up by African Americans. African Americans were the original community who said, \u201COh, by the way, we exist too.\u201D James Baldwin \u2014 \u201CI did not enter in chains. I am one of the first people in this country. I built this country.\u201D This notion of \u2014 you expand the nation to welcome multiple contributors. We see that happening right now, I think, in a deep narrative way with American Muslims. I want to kind of end my little part with something that I was rereading today that reminds me of you, Krista, actually. Somebody named \u2014 a great radio host named Norman Corwin, who was kind of the Krista Tippett of his time, if you will\u2026 \u2026these beautiful radio productions. He\u2019s got this line that I say to a lot of 20-year-olds on campuses. \u201CPost proofs that brotherhood is not so wild a dream that those who profit by postponing it pretend.\u201D That\u2019s your job, right? Post that proof. Just do that. It is a religious act, however small it might be. Just post your proof that brotherhood, sisterhood, empathy, solidarity, is not so wild a dream that these other people think it might be. Thank you, Eboo Patel and Natasha Trethewey.
