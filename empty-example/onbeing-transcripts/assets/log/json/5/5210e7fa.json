  "fullText": "The physicist Lawrence Krauss says that one of the values of science is to make us uncomfortable. I don\u2019t mean that science isn\u2019t spiritually uplifting. I do think it is, but for the very antithetical reasons to religion, I guess, is the fact that it causes us to feel less comfortable should provoke us to try and understand what we can do and what meaning we can make in the universe. So learning that the universe isn\u2019t made for us, or there\u2019s no evidence that it is, is profoundly inspiring or should be. Lawrence Krauss helps explain why we should all care about dark energy \u2014 and, for that matter, the Higgs boson particle. He believes that science literacy matters, but more importantly that we can, should take joy in science \u2014 just as we cultivate enjoyment of arts we may not completely comprehend. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being, from APM, American Public Media. I invited Lawrence Krauss\u2019s passion for science as our common human inheritance to the Chautauqua Institution in New York. We sat together in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy during the 2012 summer season. The theme for the week was inspiration, action, and commitment. Public theology has a long history at Chautauqua. And, in earlier generations, that meant a voice like Reinhold Niebuhr, an authoritative Christian voice in an overwhelmingly Christian culture. Today\u2019s guest takes us in a completely different direction, but one which I find equally distinctive and influential in our time. Lawrence Krauss is a cosmologist, a theoretical physicist, and a public scientist bringing the learnings of science to the rest of us, to the wider world. So the science-religion debate is well known, and Lawrence Krauss has strong views on that. But in my mind \u2014 I\u2019m just going to lay my cards on the table. What science might have to say about God or what religion might have to say about science is not really what either of those disciplines are for. I am, however, fascinated by how scientists in our time \u2014 neuroscientists, biologists, and certainly physicists and cosmologists \u2014 are adding their own insights and questions to realms of human inquiry that religion and philosophy long dominated. Where did we come from? What does it mean to be human? What does the future hold? What is our place in the universe? Science is as much at the center of everyday life as it\u2019s ever been. I don\u2019t think it would be an exaggeration to say that some kind of science and technology is woven throughout every moment of every day for many of us. Lawrence Krauss is foundation professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the physics departments at Arizona State University. He\u2019s the associate director of the Beyond Center there and director of the Origins Initiative. His books include The Physics of Star Trek \u2014 and we will talk about that, don\u2019t worry \u2014 Fear of Physics: A Guide to the Perplexed and, in 2012, A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing. As we start, tell us about the origins of your life as a scientist. My mother wanted me to be a doctor and my brother to be a lawyer. And, unfortunately, my brother became a lawyer and then, therefore, the pressure was on me to even more become a doctor. And my mother, unfortunately, since neither of my parents went to \u2014 even finished high school actually, I think helped get me interested in science in the sense that she mistakenly told me that, you know, doctors were scientists. Well, medicine is somewhat related. Some of medicine is, certainly. Most doctors are not scientists in the sense that \u2026 Right, right. Therefore, but I got interested in science and I started reading about it a lot when I was a kid. So reading about science, particularly about scientists and books by scientists in particular, had a big impact on me, and I guess it was sometime in high school when I realized that doctors weren\u2019t scientists and I was kind of hooked on science. Also, I had crummy biology teachers. And physics was always by far the sexiest of the disciplines and still is, by the way. In fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons why I guess I write is to return the favor because I was turned on by books by Isaac Asimov and George Gamow and people like that. I actually wasn\u2019t convinced I was going to do physics. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. I did history for a while because physics seemed detached from people and I\u2019m very political as well, as we may get to. Because in fact to amplify what you said, science is not just a part of everyday lives. It\u2019s a part of every important political decision that has to be made, yet it\u2019s never discussed by politicians, one of the things I\u2019ve been working hard to change. I mean, a very long answer to a short question, but \u2026 No, no, that\u2019s OK. But the reason people do science is not to save the world. It\u2019s because it\u2019s fun. That\u2019s the only reason that people do science. Generally, you\u2019re not going to work for 20 years on a given subject unless you enjoy it, and I think that we don\u2019t explain that enough. You have said that physics is a human, creative, intellectual activity like art and music. I mean, you talked a minute ago about the fun. I mean, you use the word pleasure. Talk some more about that. Well, yeah, no, I think it\u2019s very important. I just wrote about this. I think people somehow view science in terms \u2014 in a utilitarian way as if the value of science is the technology it produces, but I think that\u2019s completely mistaken. I think, obviously, science is responsible for the technology that\u2019s allowing us to have this discussion and pretty well everything that allows most of you to still be alive, which is vitally important and, therefore, it\u2019s changed our lives more than anything else. But to me, the most exciting thing about science is the ideas. Science has produced the most interesting ideas that humans have ever come up with, certainly among the most interesting. And somehow, although it wasn\u2019t always this way \u2014 you know, I was just having the discussion in Aspen last week on this very subject. It wasn\u2019t always this way, but now somehow the ideas of science are not a part of our culture. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to consider yourself literate if you know something about Shakespeare, but not if you know anything about the Higgs boson. And I think that\u2019s a mistake. As I say, it\u2019s relatively recent. You used to be considered illiterate if you didn\u2019t have some ability to discuss at some level natural philosophy 200 years ago or even at the turn of the last century. And now it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to say, oh, you know, I don\u2019t get science, and scientists are responsible for a lot of that, I have to say. But it\u2019s the ideas of science that make it so important for humans because it\u2019s part of what makes being human worth being human. As I often say, we don\u2019t remember the Greek plumbing. We remember their architecture and their ideas. Most people don\u2019t have to know how to build the detailed things of science, but the ideas change our perspective of our place in the cosmos. And to me, that\u2019s what great art, music, and literature is all about \u2014 is when you see a play or see a painting or hear a wonderful piece of music. In some sense, it changes your perspective of yourself. And that\u2019s what science does in a profoundly important way and a way with content that matters. You\u2019re a musical person, or you love music. You\u2019re passionate about music, aren\u2019t you? On paper, I look like a musical person. OK. I do like music. I like art, but, yeah, I like music a lot. I mean, if you\u2019ve read my biography, you know I have some apparent credentials, but they\u2019re all fake. Glad we clarified that. I was nominated for a Grammy, I will admit that. I just have no musical ability, but my daughter was very musical and played the violin in Cleveland, in fact. So I\u2019ve learned a lot through her. So I think I probably first became aware of you with The Physics of Star Trekbecause I was a huge \u2014 well, still am a huge Star Trek fan. And can I just say I\u2019m so pleased that you\u2019re talking about all the generations, you know, Commander Data. Absolutely. It\u2019s important. The voyagers, as well as next generation. That dates both of us, by the way, but in any case\u2026 OK. You know, I think as I\u2019ve spoken to lots of scientists over the years and I think sometimes it\u2019s surprising to non-scientists that scientists love science fiction. I mean, you wrote somewhere that all physicists you know watched Star Trek growing up. But then as I was thinking about this and thinking about the way you put science like in the realm of being cultured and arts. I mean, science fiction is a narrative, imaginative rendering of what scientists do and discover. It\u2019s interesting you should put it that way, in fact, because people imagine science fiction as an imaginative rendering of science when in fact science is a far more imaginative rendering of science fiction. No, somehow that\u2019s the point. Creativity is not something \u2014 and imagination are not things that are only associated with science except Richard Feynman, who I did write a book about, said, you know, science is imagination in a straitjacket. And it\u2019s far more difficult to conform your imagination to the evidence of reality than to invent your own realities. In fact, religion is an example. I\u2019ll wait for the response. Yeah. We\u2019ll get to it, but I\u2019m just not going to go there yet, OK? But anyway, no. So I did like science fiction until I discovered that science is much more interesting than science fiction. The universe continues to surprise us in ways that we would never imagine, which is why \u2014 by the way \u2014 why I\u2019m a theoretical physicist. But science and physics are empirical disciplines. And if we just thought about the universe \u2014 and, again, to not be completely facetious, philosophy was an example of that \u2014 if we just thought about the universe, we\u2019d come up with the wrong answers because the universe is far more imaginative. So we have to keep probing the universe and asking questions \u2014 and that means doing experiments and observations \u2014 because it constantly surprises us in ways that no one would have imagined. One of the things that amuses me about science fiction is how it misses all the really big things. So do other physicists watch Star Trek growing up and then they realize that science is more interesting? It\u2019s hard to know. I mean, I\u2019ve thought about that a lot. People ask me. It\u2019s hard to know if watching Star Trek influenced them to become scientists or the other way around or whether their interest in science was promoted. I think there\u2019s no doubt, and Stephen Hawking wrote the foreword for that particular book and he said, you know, it helped spur the imagination and it does. So to the extent that I think it was one of the \u2014 I used to think it was a geeky thing to watch Star Trek. It isn\u2019t. One of the things that amazed me when I wrote that particular book, that shocked me, was how broadly and deeply Star Trek had permeated not just the culture in the United States, but around the world. And it wasn\u2019t just 16-year-old boys watching it. No. And people who became scientists, lawyers \u2014 and women. It\u2019s kind of interesting. It\u2019s not a gender thing either. The reason that I think that\u2019s the case is that it presented two things: a hopeful view of the future, which science fiction doesn\u2019t often do, and a view of the future where science actually made the world a better place. The Star Trek future is a better place because of science and, I can\u2019t resist saying it here now that I think about it, but it was one of the reasons, if you know in Star Trek, that basically they dispensed with the quaint notions of myopic views of the 20th century, including most of the world\u2019s religions. Yeah, OK. We\u2019re not going to go there still. OK. I keep trying to get you there, but it\u2019s not going to work. Yeah, they did, but then you had in the next generation this kind of immortal, semi-divine \u2026 More of a Q. Q. We probably shouldn\u2019t do this. It\u2019s too inside baseball. One of my favorite characters. I wish we could talk about this for an hour. And as you\u2019ve pointed out often, you know, like literature and the arts, science is getting at origins. Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? So, but in a very different way than religion approaches these things or philosophy or the arts. So as a cosmologist \u2026 I\u2019m biting my tongue. Yeah. No, but I just want to hear from you like as a physicist, how do you approach the question of origins? What are you looking at? What are you exploring? Well, I think I\u2019m exploring the same questions that people have had since people have been people. We all want to know where we come from, how the universe originated, how it\u2019ll end, what we\u2019re made of. And that naturally does lead to questions of is there a purpose and are we here for a reason, I think. But those aren\u2019t science questions. Those aren\u2019t scientific questions. And, in fact, that\u2019s what I was just going to get at. They\u2019re not scientific questions. I\u2019ve gotten in a lot of trouble from some philosophers recently because I use the word why. Why is there something rather than nothing? And, in fact, as I say very clearly in the book, why questions don\u2019t mean anything. They\u2019re content-free. Any of you who have children have been asked why, why, why? In the end, ultimately the only answer to that is because. And that is also content-free because why presumes purpose. Whenever we say, we really mean how, at least in science. In science, yeah. And it\u2019s true and that has content. When we mean why in religion, we\u2019re presuming the answer before we ask the question. We\u2019re presuming there\u2019s purpose. There must be a reason for our existence, otherwise why? And science doesn\u2019t make presumption, and the remarkable thing is science finds the universe works pretty well without that presumption. So when we ask, as we used to ask, you know, we could ask the question why are there nine planets? And there are nine planets, by the way. Pluto is a planet. I don\u2019t care what my friend Neil Tyson says. My daughter studied Pluto in grade four and did a project on Pluto and I don\u2019t plan for her to go back. But when we ask that question, we don\u2019t \u2014 when Kepler asked the question, say, why are there five planets, he might have meant there was some divine purpose. He would talk about the Platonic solids and all that. But now we\u2019ve changed the meaning of that because we realize that not only are there not five planets, but there\u2019s nothing special about nine planets. There are solar systems around most stars we see. We\u2019ve discovered 2,000 planets already. So the question we really mean is how are there nine planets? How did our solar system arise? Is it different than other solar systems? Is it natural to have an Earth-like planet? Could there be life elsewhere? Those are productive questions. So science changes the kind of questions we ask by changing the meaning of words because we learn things. We change the meaning because we understand the universe and we make progress. And I would argue that\u2019s why science \u2014 it\u2019s nothing wrong about changing the meaning. It\u2019s because there\u2019s progress in science unlike, you know, theology. I\u2019m sorry. I keep trying to hope I\u2019ll provoke some people here. But what I mean by that is one of the values of science is to make us uncomfortable. Somehow that\u2019s supposed to be a bad thing for many people, being uncomfortable. Being uncomfortable is a good thing because it forces you to reassess your place in the cosmos. And being too comfortable means you\u2019ve become complacent and you stop thinking. So being uncomfortable should be a spiritually uplifting experience. I don\u2019t mean that science isn\u2019t spiritually uplifting. I do think it is, but for the very reasons \u2014 the very antithetical reasons to religion, I guess, is the fact that it causes us to feel less comfortable should provoke us to try and understand what we can do and what meaning we can make in the universe. So learning that we\u2019re more insignificant or learning that the universe isn\u2019t made for us, or there\u2019s no evidence that it is, is profoundly inspiring or should be. But I really want you to tell me, as a cosmologist, when you think of origins, stars, right? Stars that died \u2026 The reason I created the Origins Project or helped create the Origins Project at Arizona State and the reason I moved there to lead it is all of the interesting questions that I can see in science and, to most part, in scholarship beyond science, have to do with origins. The questions at the forefront of every field are origins questions. They\u2019re really the heart that you\u2019re trying to get at. In the case of the universe, you know, how did the universe begin? You know, are we the only universe? What happened before the big bang? All those origins questions. But we study everything from the origins of the universe to the origins of life. Origins of life questions are profoundly interesting from a philosophical, but more importantly, from a scientific perspective right now. The origins of consciousness \u2014 if you think of the frontiers of human investigation, they inevitably involve origins and we\u2019ve been pushing those origins questions back. Origins questions 200 years ago, when Darwin asked them, would have been very different. Remember, Darwin in Origin of Species said \u2014 I think it was in Origin of Species; it might have been The Descent of Man \u2014 said \u2014 he never talked about the origin of life, by the way, right? He talked about the origin of the diversity of species. He never talked about the origin of life itself, and once he just poo-pooed it. He said origins of life, you might as well talk about the origins of matter because \u2026 OK. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about now. Exactly. And that\u2019s what\u2019s great. We\u2019re pushing back those frontiers. The reason I became a particle physicist is because it\u2019s the fundamental structure of the universe that ultimately sheds light on all the complexity that we see. The universe seems to be incredibly complex. And one of the beauties of science is at some level the diversity of life, the complexity of the phenomena we see, we can understand in terms of a few very basic principles and how remarkable that is. I mean, how amazing that is, and that we should celebrate that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with physicist and public scientist Lawrence Krauss at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. So one thing you\u2019re really great at is explaining, you know, taking concepts of physics. I thought we might do a little bit of that, but maybe we save that for, you know, we ask you \u2026 If there\u2019s any burning question you have, I\u2019m happy to answer it. I have lots of burning questions. But I think maybe what would be fun to talk about now specifically is the Higgs boson, which is something that\u2019s out there that we\u2019re talking about that\u2019s not new, but newly, more likely, right? I mean, you can\u2019t say 150 percent proven, but there\u2019s new evidence, right? It certainly captured \u2014 yeah, not only captured the imagination of physicists from around the world \u2026 And that is one of these fundamental ways of talking about what it\u2019s all made up and how it comes together. You know, how do you answer what is Higgs boson and why should I care? Well, the answer is not so pat as you often hear. People often say, well, it\u2019s responsible for mass, but it\u2019s not that. I was just doing an interview yesterday where someone said, well, I never asked why there was mass, so why should I care? And it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not as if you wake up and say, gee, why do particles have mass? It could be just a given. But there\u2019s a much more interesting, intellectual reason why we\u2019re led there and it\u2019s a reason that we should celebrate. But I bet most of the people here don\u2019t know why we should celebrate. So I\u2019ll explain it. OK. We should celebrate revolution in our understanding that took place about 45 years ago or within the last 50 years, a totally complete revolution in our understanding of the universe that\u2019s been unheralded. You don\u2019t read about it much. In the early 1960s, there were four forces in nature, electromagnetism, which you know of, and gravity, the two you\u2019re mostly familiar with. There are two more, called the strong force and the weak force. In 1962 or \u201963, we understand one, one force in nature. Electromagnetism was the only force we understood as a quantum theory. Quantum mechanics is the theory that governs matter on very small scales and forces. What is remarkable is, within a decade, we understood three of those four forces of nature. I mean, it was one of the most amazing periods of scientific expansion in understanding the universe, and one of the most beautiful aspects of that is we understood that all of the forces in nature could be understood in terms of a single mathematical formulism. They had exactly the same structure mathematically, which is profoundly interesting, but even more interesting perhaps, you know you\u2019ve made a breakthrough in science when two things that seem very, very different suddenly are recognized as being different aspects of the same thing. The electromagnetic force is long-range. I can experience it across the room. The weak force operates only on the scale of nuclei. Those two very different forces could be understood as different aspects of the same thing. Now how can that be? Well, they could be same if at a fundamental scale all the particles are masses. They can be described by exactly the same mathematics. And then what happens is, the mass of the particles that convey the weak force is an accident. It\u2019s an accident of our existence if \u2014 and this was what seemed too good to be true \u2014 if this invisible field permeates all of space, you can\u2019t see it, but if the particles that convey the weak force interact with that field and get slowed down like swimming through molasses, get retarded because of that interaction, they act like they\u2019re massive. And it just seemed too good to be true. It seemed to be too good to be true for me. OK, so it\u2019s like things appear to have mass the way they do because of the relationship they have to this field as opposed to something that\u2019s intrinsically given. But we were driven to it not because the particles that make you and I have that mass, but because of this beautiful unification. That was what drove us to it. Then people say, hey, maybe if it\u2019s true for these particles called the W and Z bosons, maybe it\u2019s true for all the particles. Maybe all the particles can be mass less and the Higgs field \u2026 Including the atoms that make us? Well, including many of the particles that make us up, not all of them, it turns out. But the ones that are heavier act heavier because they interact more strongly with that field and the ones that are lighter are lighter because they attract less strongly and the ones that are mass less don\u2019t interact at all. And light travels at the speed of light, so it doesn\u2019t slow down and doesn\u2019t get all \u2026 It doesn\u2019t slow down because it doesn\u2019t interact at all. Photons don\u2019t interact. That was a proposed property. Now what\u2019s amazing, as I said, seems kind of slimy, doesn\u2019t it, to invent \u2014 well, I won\u2019t make a comment about religion. No, good. But inventing invisible forces is not what science is all about. It\u2019s what other things are all about. Science should be, if it\u2019s there, we should be able to detect it. But the great thing is, so if it turns out it\u2019s a consequence, that if there is this invisible field that\u2019s doing all this marvelous stuff, then physics says if you hit it hard enough, if you smack that field hard enough with enough energy in a small enough region, you\u2019ll produce real particles. That\u2019s a prediction and those real particles \u2014 the field is called a Higgs field \u2014 those real particles would be called Higgs particles. So if that field exists, you should be able to produce particles and see them, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been trying to do for the last 50 years. And that\u2019s what happened in 2012? That\u2019s what just happened, we think. We built the machine. We were building the machine in this country 25 years ago, well, 20 years ago, that would have been sure to detect these particles, we think. But Congress, in its wisdom and then when it was much wiser was still pretty stupid, decided that even after building the biggest tunnel that had ever been built, 60 miles around in Texas underground, decided they couldn\u2019t afford the $5 billion dollars to finish the project, which is now what the cost of air conditioning for a day during the Iraq War or something. But we decided we couldn\u2019t built it, so it\u2019s been built in Geneva. Fine, that\u2019s life. So I want to understand this so badly. You know, I struggle to understand it. So when we talk about the Higgs boson that is an expression of the field, right? Well, in quantum physics, fields and particles are the same thing. All fields exist. The electric field, when you feel static electricity, classically that\u2019s an electric field. Maxwell and Faraday described it beautifully. In fact, the first major unification was the unification of electricity and magnetism, two very different-seeming forces were understood by Maxwell and Faraday and others to be different manifestations of the same thing. Beautiful, just beautiful. But that field that they called a field, we now understand is due to the exchange of particles, photons. And the weak force due to the exchange of W and Z bosons. And we understand that the Higgs field, the reason particles feel mass is by exchanging particles with that Higgs field, Higgs particles. And if they exist, as I say, we have to be able to detect them and we even predict many of their properties. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not just a crapshoot. And the particle that\u2019s been observed, the bump that\u2019s been observed in Geneva, is Higgs-like. It seems to have all the properties of the Higgs, and it\u2019s where we kind of would have expected it maybe to be, which is what surprised me because I was betting against it. I was sure this beautiful \u2026 Like Stephen Hawking betted against it too, right? He lost his 100 dollars. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s one of the few times that Stephen and I agree, in fact. But it just seemed to good to be true and it\u2019s so rare that nature obeys what we imagine to be true, that I thought nature would come up with a much more interesting way around it. In fact, what\u2019s really beautiful is every time we make a discovery in science, we end up having more questions than answers. Having discovered the Higgs, if that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, does not close the book because we still don\u2019t understand why this Higgs field exists in the universe, which is really and why \u2014 and by why I mean how \u2026 Why that Higgs field exists because that\u2019s really what\u2019s responsible for our existence. We wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for it. And we think that, besides just discovering it\u2019s particle, there are other tantalizing hints, in fact, in the nature of what\u2019s been discovered plus what we expect. It\u2019ll say the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva will point us in the right direction to answering those questions. We\u2019ve been, as I often say, like people locked in a room with sensory deprivation for 40 years. What happens? You hallucinate, and that\u2019s what most of the business of what I\u2019ve been in is hallucinating for the last 40 years. Most of the hallucinations we\u2019ve had, namely theoretical physics, will be wrong. Most ideas are wrong. We don\u2019t celebrate that enough, but it\u2019s true. Most ideas are wrong, so all of the ideas may be wrong. But we won\u2019t know until nature points us in the right direction. And I think, and many other people think, that if what we really discovered is the Higgs, there\u2019s bound to be new things at the Large Hadron Collider that will point us in the much more interesting direction. And you don\u2019t even know what that direction is right now. No, no. I mean, I have speculations. I have ideas and so do other theorists. I always hope I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019ve often said the two greatest states to be in if you\u2019re a scientist is either wrong or confused, and I\u2019m often both. Yes, and in a positive way, you talk about that as beautiful and mystery is a word that\u2019s absolutely part of your vocabulary. Mysteries are what it\u2019s all about. In fact, not knowing is much more exciting than knowing, right? Because it means there\u2019s much more to learn. The search is often much more exciting than the finding. Mysteries are what drive us as human beings. I think it\u2019s really what drives scientists. And the beautiful mysteries of the universe are what should keep propelling us because we are fortunate enough for whatever reason to have an intellect and have evolved \u2014and I can still say that in the United States \u2014 to have evolved a consciousness that allows us to ask those questions and to stop asking them is just a tragedy.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, my conversation with physicist and public scientist Lawrence Krauss. His books include The Physics of Star Trekand A Universe from Nothing. I interviewed him before an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor Hall of Philosophy of the Chautauqua Institution. We\u2019ve been talking about the nature and meaning of science in human life. We haven\u2019t delved yet into the subject of religion \u2014 on which Lawrence Krauss also has famously impassioned views. OK, so here is where I want to talk about religion. Oh, good. Good, because when we talk about stop asking those questions, it\u2019s a natural segue to religion. But actually, actually what I was going to say is I think a reverence for mystery is something that great scientists and mystics and, in fact, our traditions at their orthodox cores have in common. There\u2019s the shared language of mystery. Yeah, I\u2019ll give you that. No, I mean, the origin \u2026 Thank you. Yeah, except that science has changed the language because science has meaning. And I don\u2019t mean that in a facetious way. I really don\u2019t. I think that science and religion and mysticism all have their origins in the same \u2014 in being human. They all have common origins. The difference is that science has moved beyond, has taken us beyond our childhood. So one thing that happens to me because I spend my life in conversations, so I started to have this cumulative conversation in my head, and so a couple of people I was thinking of as I was reading you, a geneticist, Lindon Eaves, do you know him? He\u2019s done a lot of the biggest long-term studies of twins, and he\u2019s also an Anglican priest. And he said to me that, when he was in his laboratory, religion most of the time had no place there. So, I keep it \u2014 I hold it at bay. At the same time, when he\u2019s sitting at the bedside of somebody who\u2019s dying of cancer, science has nothing to say in that moment. There\u2019s meaning \u2026 Oh, I disagree about that. You know, I know all these people say \u2014 a very famous biologist said, \u201CThe minute I go in the lab, I\u2019m an atheist.\u201D What does science have to say to death, to dying, not to the biological breakdown of a body, but to the existential moment of dying? I think it has a tremendous amount to say. I mean, it has to say to us that, you know, first of all, it has to say what dying is. What is dying? What\u2019s the process of dying? OK, there\u2019s that, there\u2019s that. No, no. I mean, we\u2019re all going to experience it, and I think a realistic assessment of what the process is helps us understand what we\u2019re going to experience and try and make sense of it. It seems to me you can\u2019t make sense enough to make even an ethical or moral decision without understanding the basis in reality. What seems to me what science could say is what I\u2019ve sort of said in the book is that, look, what I\u2019m about to say is going to sound awful, and I\u2019m not going to go to someone\u2019s bedside and offer this, OK? It\u2019s up to them to decide if they want to look at these things. But we should at least offer the possibility of that knowledge that there\u2019s no evidence \u2014 in fact every bit of evidence that there\u2019s no afterlife, that you\u2019re here, but in fact the meaning of your life is the meaning that you make. And in your life, you\u2019ve made incredible meaning. You created love for other people. You\u2019ve brought up children. You\u2019ve allowed people to have livelihoods and that meaning has made your life worthwhile and enjoy every second of being alive. And death is a sad but necessary part of being alive. That may not sound like the same comfort of saying that, you know, you\u2019re going to have eternal life and you\u2019re going to be with your family \u2026 I don\u2019t think Lindon Eaves is talking to people about eternal life. No, but I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s any less comforting than \u2026 But what you just said isn\u2019t science. Yes, it is. It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no evidence. I mean, here\u2019s what we\u2019re saying is that \u2026 But you can\u2019t put meaning under a microscope. You can\u2019t shoot particles at it in a Large Hadron Collider. No, but I don\u2019t understand what meaning is till I ask the questions of how the universe behaves. And look, there could be \u2014 we can never disprove purpose, you know, so I can never say there\u2019s no purpose to the universe. I could just say the universe behaves as if there\u2019s no purpose, but that may just mean I\u2019m missing the point, as a lot of people may think. But there could have been. You can answer it in the positive, but there\u2019s no evidence. If the stars tonight realign themselves and said I am here \u2014 in Greek, presumably ancient Greek \u2014 then, hey, I\u2019d say, you know, maybe there\u2019s something to all this. But in the absence of that, if Bertrand Russell said, you know, I can\u2019t disprove that there\u2019s a teapot orbiting Jupiter, and I can\u2019t. There\u2019s no evidence of it and it\u2019s highly unlikely. And I think providing that reality check is useful to people, not just when they\u2019re dying, but when they\u2019re alive, seems to me. You know, some people say that religion gives meaning to their lives, but to me, the knowledge that the meaning we have is the meaning we make should inspire us to do better. So I think that \u2014 I personally think that every single thing that religion provides, rationality, empiricism and science can provide, and not only that, it can provide it better. Well, what do you know? So the other voice that was in my head was somebody who I did not interview in person, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. He talked a lot \u2014 he talked a lot like you do about radical amazement, that the whole point of life is to be surprised and to be surprised over and over again and that spiritual life is about learning to be surprised. And here\u2019s something he wrote. \u201CIt is customary to blame secular science and anti-religious philosophy for the eclipse of religion in modern society. It would be more honest to blame religion for its own defeats. Religion declined not because it was refuted, but because it became irrelevant, dull, oppressive, insipid. When faith is completely replaced by creed, worship by discipline, love by habit, when the crisis of today is ignored because of the splendor of the past, when faith becomes an heirloom rather than a living fountain, when religion speaks only in the name of authority rather than with the voice of compassion, its message becomes meaningless.\u201D And I just read that because, when I read you talking about religion \u2014 and I really don\u2019t want to debate it because \u2026 There\u2019s no debate. I mean, we\u2019re having a discussion. Yeah, yeah, I do to. I feel like I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve been exposed to that kind of religious voice, which I think you would enjoy \u2026 I mean, I think it\u2019s a brilliant statement. You know, wisdom is not the province of just \u2014 of scientists or of anyone. I mean, you know, and that\u2019s a wise statement. Wisdom comes from experience and knowledge and understanding history and understanding the universe. The reason to know things is in some sense to reflect on them and become wiser and it\u2019s not the province of anyone. And people seem to think I suggest that it\u2019s the province of science. Science is the raw material that provides the basis of wisdom for some people. And so I don\u2019t want to stereotype religion per se, and there are brilliant statements. I\u2019ve often quoted them. I\u2019ve gone into many places and fundamentalist colleges and Fox News and, you know, I quote Moses Maimonides and St. Augustine. I mean, they\u2019re brilliant statements. My favorite statement of Maimonides, more or less paraphrased, you know, as he said, the Scriptures are absolutely true. But if your interpretation of the Scriptures disagrees with the evidence of science, you should reexamine your interpretation of the Scriptures. There\u2019s a lot of wisdom in all of that. What I\u2019m amazed about is when someone as wise as that rabbi \u2026 Heschel, mm-hmm. \u2026 yeah, says those things, I don\u2019t \u2014 what I don\u2019t understand is why they need religion. I mean, if you\u2019re a rabbi, at some level, you buy into the importance of Judaism. Many of my friends \u2014 one of their mothers-in-law is here today who \u2026 One of your mothers-in-law? No, one of their mothers-in-law, not one of mine. I only have one. They often say, well, you don\u2019t have to believe in God to be Jewish and I say that\u2019s absolutely true, but what\u2019s the point? I mean, there\u2019s cultural wisdom. You know, there\u2019s beauty in the masses that have been written for the church. There\u2019s beauty in the paintings that Leonardo da Vinci and others and Michelangelo and others did in the context of religion, but that\u2019s just the response to the culture of the time and I don\u2019t see why, given what you know now, you can\u2019t have that same wisdom without discarding the provincial basis of it, which was based, let\u2019s face it, on the imaginings of illiterate peasants, Bronze Age peasants, before we knew the Earth even orbited the sun. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being, today at the Chautauqua Institution with physicist and public scientist Lawrence Krauss. I interviewed him in a week devoted to themes of inspiration, action, and commitment, including others like the Buddhist anthropologist Joan Halifax, the Muslim social activist Rami Nashashibi, and Homeboy Industries founder Fr. Greg Boyle. So one of the things that the other people I\u2019ve been talking to this week, the other people who\u2019ve been here at Chautauqua are all religious people who\u2019ve been working and serving others, right, in compassion and \u2026 Doing much more useful stuff than I do. I\u2019ll buy that. Well, you know, working with people who need help. And this concept of the other comes up and the problem human beings have with the other. And it\u2019s a problem not just for religion, but for our society. You have talked about the other in these terms: that we are connected organically to everyone who\u2019s ever lived, even our enemies, through the atoms and the oxygen we breathe. I mean, I think that is an example of science throwing this fabulous new light on something that vexes us. Absolutely, in a much more productive way than saying we\u2019re all brothers under the skin or something. Because we really are, but it\u2019s really amazing. Every time you breathe in, you breathe in atoms from virtually everyone who\u2019s ever lived. Every time you take a drink of water, you\u2019re drinking the secretions of every slimy thing that\u2019s ever been around. You know, as I said in the beginning of the book Atom, my mother used to tell me when I picked up a glass of water, \u201CDon\u2019t touch that. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s been.\u201D She had no idea. But I think that\u2019s exactly to me what science can provide is a realistic basis of understanding how artificial and myopic the definitions of us versus our enemies are. Not only are we made of the same things, we\u2019re made of their atoms. And every atom in our body was once inside a star that exploded, one of the most poetic things I know about the universe, that we\u2019re all stardust. These are amazing things and they have content and they\u2019re true. I mean, those three things are great. You can be amazed without the latter two. But I think when you get all three, it\u2019s really something. Yeah. We have to open this up for questions, because we are \u2014 this is so interesting and we\u2019re running out of time. So let\u2019s get going. Audience Participant: How do you define love and from where does it come? Well, first of all, I\u2019m not an evolutionary psychologist or neurologist or neuroscientist. But I think it comes, from my understanding and my effort to understand that, suggests it comes from many different areas. It certainly comes from chemistry, hormones, not just sexual hormones, but many other aspects of what drives our perceptions of ourselves and others. It comes from logic as well. It comes from understanding. It comes from the effort to understand someone and find that they somehow mirror everything you like about nature, that everything you admire and respect. I\u2019m deeply in love right now, and I think the reasons for that is that the person I\u2019m deeply in love with reflects all of those aspects of the universe that I admire. But I also realize that there\u2019s many other aspects, physiological and chemical ones, that drive that, and I\u2019d be a fool to think that I wasn\u2019t driven by those physical processes. Do we understand all of it? No, but that\u2019s the great thing. Not understanding it is wonderful because it means there\u2019s so much more to learn about what drives us as human beings to understand ourselves. And maybe when we do, we\u2019ll be better at love. Yes? Audience Participant: Thank you. Can you explain to us what dark energy and dark matter are and why \u2014 excuse me, how \u2014 it\u2019s important to us? You have about two minutes for that. Well, they are almost everything in the universe. Let me make it quite clear that you are indeed far more insignificant than you ever imagined. Not just you, but you, not me, but all of you, but, uh, no, all of us, because we have learned that, if you\u2019d look at everything we could see, the beauty of the night sky here and it\u2019s nice and dark at night. I was looking last night at the stars. The beauty of the night sky and everything we see is just a bit of cosmic pollution in a universe full of dark matter and dark energy. Ninety-nine percent of the universe, 30 percent of the universe roughly is this dark matter, which is made, we\u2019re reasonably convinced, of some new type of elementary particle that doesn\u2019t exist here on earth. Seventy percent is dark energy, which is the energy of nothing. One of the reasons I wrote this book that you\u2019re all going to buy, that empty space weighs something. It\u2019s amazing. Who would have thought that? Empty space weighs something. And most of the energy in the universe resides in empty space. Space wasn\u2019t really the right word, was it? What? Space. No, space is still there. It\u2019s full, right? And it\u2019s even empty. There\u2019s not stuff in there. There\u2019s nothing. You can look for it and there\u2019s nothing there, but it weighs something. And what it really means, Krista, is that it changed what we mean by nothing. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Science changes what we mean by things all the time as we learn. That\u2019s what learning is all about. We change the meaning of things that we thought of before in a rough \u2014 and love. We may change what we mean by love when we understand it more, or morality or lots of other ideas that are at the forefront of our understanding. But to get back to your question, so that\u2019s the dominant stuff in the universe and everything we see is 1 percent. You get rid of everything we see, all the stars, planets, people, aliens, everything, and the universe would be essentially exactly the same. So much for a universe made for us. We\u2019re just a relevant byproduct and that\u2019s wonderful, that\u2019s wonderful. But the other reason you might care is that it\u2019s responsible for our existence. We now understand that without dark matter, for example, galaxies would never have formed. It was necessary for that dark matter to exist and be different than the normal matter in order for galaxies to form and therefore stars and therefore planets and therefore people and therefore, theologians or whoever else. And therefore it\u2019s responsible for our existence. Now it will never produce a better toaster, I doubt. It won\u2019t do anything useful and therefore you might say why should we care about it? What amazes me, to get back to the question you asked at the beginning, is why people ask that question. Because they never ask that question of why, what use is a Mozart concerto? What use is a Picasso painting? What use is James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses or whatever? But, you know, that\u2019s why we have to have people like you because we can\u2019t take that in. We don\u2019t know how to enjoy that. You can\u2019t turn up like you can for a concert. You\u2019re right. I agree. There\u2019s a bigger barrier. But at the same time, you can enjoy it, I would argue, and most people just give up and scientists are a large part of it. Most people, when it says come to science, well, I just don\u2019t understand it. They give up thinking, and that\u2019s a really sad part of our culture. You know, people don\u2019t say, you know what? I can\u2019t enjoy music unless I\u2019m a musician. I can\u2019t enjoy art unless I\u2019m an artist. But you know what? Unless I\u2019m a scientist, I can\u2019t enjoy science. There is a great deal to enjoy and, of course, that\u2019s one of the reasons why I do what I do. But we have to get over this idea that you don\u2019t have to think at all. Well, you have to think a little bit. I want to come at this slightly different angle in just our last couple of minutes. OK, sure. One scientist talked to me about the spirituality of a scientist, and here\u2019s how he described it. He said, \u201CThe spirituality of a scientist is like the spirituality of a mystic, which is that in any given moment you are discerning truth as best you can and you\u2019re also completely aware that you have everything yet to discover.\u201D An evolutionary biologist who\u2019s not religious recently said to me that he thinks scientists need to recover the word spirituality. He said we talk about it. We talk about the spirit of inquiry. So I just want to ask you, you know, very personally. Like, you know, if you did use that phrase, the spirituality of scientists, what would that mean for you? I think you\u2019ve captured some of it. If I had to use the term, I\u2019d use awe in the wonder of nature and the realization that spirituality isn\u2019t having the answers before you ask the questions. And that\u2019s the main thing: that real spirituality comes from asking the questions and opening your mind to what the answers might be. Lawrence Krauss, thank you.
