  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CLiving Differently, Beyond Economic Crisis,\u201D a new installment in our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue.\u201D Hundreds of listeners have joined our conversation about the human and the practical spiritual aspect of our economic present. This hour you\u2019ll hear eight of their voices putting words around experiences many of us are having and imparting some wisdom from disparate angles on life. When I lost my job, I experienced this shame. Even though it happened really through no fault of my own, I was afraid to tell people. It was almost like contracting a disease. It\u2019s sort of like the search for money has become a sacred thing, as opposed to the care and love of people, you know, and our common life together. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This hour, a new installment in our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue,\u201D bringing the voices of our listeners into a conversation we\u2019ve been building online and on air since the economic downturn began in the fall of 2008. We\u2019ve been tracing the spiritual and moral contours of our economic present, how changed circumstances are confronting many of us with questions of what matters in life and what most deeply sustains us, what we are learning in this moment and how we might live differently beyond it to shape the next American dream. Many are grappling with the shame that comes in American culture with the loss of the job. Many are seeking community in old places and new. For some, economic instability \u2014 a kind of life on the edge \u2014 is not new. They\u2019ve been cultivating virtues of patience, self-examination, service, and good humor that might help us all. From American Public Media this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today \u2014 as part of our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue\u201D \u2014 \u201CLiving Differently, Beyond Economic Crisis,\u201D featuring you, our listeners. What\u2019s going on in the world around me is somehow now matching the way that I have been living my life for a while. When I think of the word \u201Ccrisis,\u201D I always think it is something we always think of as coming unexpectedly or going away quickly. I don\u2019t think that is going to happen in this case. When I lost my job, I experienced this shame. Even though it happened really through no fault of my own, I was afraid to tell people. It was almost like contracting a disease. It\u2019s sort of like the search for money has become a sacred thing, as opposed to the care and love of people and our common life together. Maybe we would have an American dream that is more of a right, a human right, and not just an American purchase We received beautiful, thoughtful essays from disparate places, vocations, and spiritual perspectives. We chose a cross section of these and called people up at home or at work. They read from the stories they\u2019d written and had a conversation with our producers. We selected eight voices who put words around experiences many of us are having and who also impart some wisdom from their particular angle on life. We begin with Khalid Kamau. He grew up in Atlanta but now lives in New York City where he was, until January, a financial analyst for a nonprofit. He responded to our questions with this story, which we asked him to read. Once when I was young, I came home after school and baked a cake for my mom for dinner. I wanted to surprise her. She\u2019s a nurse and had been at work all day, you know, before starting her second shift as our mom. So I pulled down a box of cake mix. And after I emptied the cake mix in the bowl, I saw that the recipe called for eggs, and we were out. I remembered the stories my family would tell about growing up in the rural segregated South. Though Jim Crow blacks suffered severe institutional oppression, their communities were strong and neighbors were always helping one another out. People would come over and ask for a cup of sugar or a loaf of bread, and \u201Cif you had it, you gave it,\u201D my mom would say. So that day, I went across the street to Miss Jessie, our retired neighbor, who kept an eye on my brother and I in the afternoons until my mom or dad got home. I knew she would have some eggs and maybe even fondly recall the same traditions of sharing my parents spoke of. Well, Miss Jessie did have eggs and stories of her own about communities sharing their resources in the Great Depression and the segregated South. I got my two eggs and finished baking the cake. When my mother arrived, I presented her with the cake and proudly recounted all my efforts and resourcefulness. But the glow from her face quickly faded when I got to the part about borrowing the eggs. She called my father into the kitchen, and together they scolded me about going around the neighborhood begging for food. \u201CBut I thought that\u2019s what you guys did in the olden days,\u201D I asked. \u201CThat was a long time ago,\u201D my mother said. \u201CThings are different now.\u201D It appears that in today\u2019s culture, strong communities are those where estranged neighbors live on islands with no need for one another. Where sharing is not a practice of healthy community-building, but an act of last resort for the desperate and destitute. I have only once since borrowed pantry supplies from a neighbor, and they were also my best friends. In October 2008, when the market began to collapse, I secretly hoped the crash would be so complete that our middle-class pretenses would fall with our capitalist system. Instead, what I see is a president, a Congress, and a marketplace eager to maintain the status quo. But they\u2019re just taking their marching orders from us, the American people. It seems we\u2019re still willing to do anything to keep from knocking on our neighbor\u2019s door to ask for eggs. I live in Harlem, and a lot of my friends are in finance and a lot of them have been laid off. Most of us are young and single. Our situations individually are not as desperate as things that I\u2019ve seen go on around me, but one of the first things that happened when I lost my job is I that experienced this shame. You know, even though it happened really through no fault of my own, I was afraid to tell people. It was almost like contracting a disease, you know, that has some sort of stigma around it. But one of the things that I\u2019ve done is now I tell everyone, you know. Probably by the end of that day if not by the next morning, like, I got up and I called everyone that I knew and I told them that I didn\u2019t have a job. You know, I went to church at night, and I would tell people. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily make an announcement, but it would just come up. Or I would make sure that it came up because I think there is a sort of way that people will just assume that you still have a job, and you can let people assume that. So that\u2019s sort of been my first step in asking for help, is to just let people know that I might need it sometime soon in the future because I don\u2019t have a job. But it\u2019s still hard to bring that up. I live with roommates, and sometimes we\u2019ll buy things together or we\u2019ll go in for purchases together, and I haven\u2019t been able to necessarily do that all of the time and there still is some shame around that. I don\u2019t know. I guess I work through it every day. In this other life that I had \u2014 I was a financial analyst \u2014 I was just always busy. You know, I was too busy to do everything. And I have to say that I don\u2019t think \u2014 though I don\u2019t have as many material things, I feel like I have more time. And so I actually feel wealthier in a way. And one of the things we hear often in a workplace is you have to leave your personal problems at home, but very often you bring the stress from your job home, and your job isn\u2019t really too concerned with what you\u2019re taking home as long as you don\u2019t bring anything back. Now I really do just feel like a weight has been lifted. All of these worries that I had at work \u2014 which were really all about, like, paperwork and office politics and things that really in the long run don\u2019t even matter \u2014 I am doing more chores on my own, and I\u2019m able to pursue things like school and writing that I\u2019m more interested in. But I also think that there is \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t do anything. You know, sometimes I lay in bed and watch television all day. Or I lay in bed and don\u2019t do anything for an entire morning. I think there\u2019s this urge and I really think it\u2019s this capitalist urge, It\u2019s this urge of consumption, to wherever there is an empty space that it needs to be filled with something, and we usually have to spend money to fill it. And the same thing happens with time. I think the first week I was off I was feeling really guilty and unproductive because I had all of these extra hours that weren\u2019t filled up with things. But I kind of decided that instead of filling them up with things that aren\u2019t important that maybe I just won\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t think necessarily that \u2014 I mean, this is the sort of thing that will sound completely irresponsible and completely lazy, but I think in some other society I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s really a need to fill time up just to fill it up. And I think it\u2019s sort of made me reevaluate time. Khalid Kamau of New York City. Just before we went to broadcast, he let us know that he recently took a new job as operations manager of an elementary charter school in the Bronx. Emily Muschinske of South Orange, New Jersey, is a designer and illustrator of children\u2019s books. And even before she herself lost her job recently, she\u2019s watched several rounds of economic downturn in the publishing industry. Publishing is an industry that\u2019s kind of all over the map. You know, one year you\u2019re having a good year, the next year it\u2019s terrible and they cancel Bagel Day and they tightened up the purse strings. Nobody gets a raise. And that\u2019s been my experience ever since my career started, so I think I\u2019m a little bit jaded at this point as much, as I wish I weren\u2019t. But the way you see the company and the way you see your department and your co-workers and the people who you sit next to, that\u2019s very different. Emily Muschinske is thinking a lot these days, she says, about the emotional toll that cycles of layoffs are taking, as she wrote to us, \u201Con those of cut off suddenly from the life and people we came to know, trust, and sometimes even love.\u201D In her essay, she posed these questions: How do we fight the bitterness, the powerlessness we feel after a layoff? How do we return to our work with an expansive open spirit ready to share our lives with new people and contribute to the group in a good way?\u201D Emily Muschinske has two young children, and she\u2019s also trying to be more intentional every day about what sources of ideas and inspiration she invites into her mind and her home. I really love comedy, and I always think, you know, these are people who are on this earth to make people smile and they\u2019re committed to it. People like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert and Tina Fey can make us laugh at what\u2019s going on in the news. So I started pursuing these people. I started sort of searching around, you know, are there any podcasts that I can listen to? And I try to, as much as I can, take that in. And I feel like at its core laughing is so nourishing to the spirit, and that\u2019s an act of faith right there. You know, I have some people in my family that are survivors of the Holocaust, and it\u2019s just really inspiring. They came through so much and they had to restart their lives. And they came to the U.S. and started from scratch and had families and raised their children and they thrived. So I try to look at that and say this isn\u2019t even close to that scale, and hopefully we\u2019ll come through it and we\u2019ll recover as they recovered and as the people who survived the Depression recovered. I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019ll just be, looking back, a blip on the screen rather than something that defines a huge swath of your life. There\u2019s a tendency to feel sorry for yourself and to sort of pity yourself if you have been laid off. You know, it\u2019s a rejection. Even if you know it\u2019s not personal and even if your whole department got laid off and you weren\u2019t singled out, it\u2019s still very hard to avoid these thoughts, that somehow you\u2019ve failed and it\u2019s your fault. I\u2019m trying not to go there, and there\u2019s a choice you can make about how far you go into those thoughts. I\u2019ve been home with my son, who\u2019s three, a lot and he\u2019s at this stage where he\u2019s learning how to ask for something without throwing a temper tantrum. He wants something and he feels he has to ask for it in a whine. And you\u2019re trying to say, \u201CJust ask for it in a normal voice. Just ask for it and don\u2019t feel self-pity and don\u2019t feel sad. Just ask for what you need and it\u2019s going to be OK if you don\u2019t get exactly what you think you want.\u201D So I\u2019ve been kind of trying to apply that to myself a little bit. Just put it out there, put yourself out there, and don\u2019t whine about it and don\u2019t throw a fit. Just wait and something\u2019s going to come to you. It might not be the thing that you think you want, but it\u2019ll be something. to speakingoffaith.org to listen to our extended interviews with Emily Muschinske of South Orange, New Jersey, and with Khalid Kamau of New York City. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, our listeners reflect on living differently in and beyond economic crisis, part of our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue.\u201D How are my students responding? I cannot get them to talk that much about it. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re provided words by their faith traditions or their families on how to embrace or see themselves as part of this new day. It\u2019s really difficult to gauge what they\u2019re thinking when they go home for break. I don\u2019t get a sense of the table conversations that they have at home. It often comes when I learn that someone is not coming back. Marc Mullinax is a professor of religion and philosophy of Mars Hill College in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. He\u2019s also an ordained Baptist minister. In recent years, he\u2019s taken the Christian season of Lent seriously, though it was not a big part of the Protestant world he grew up in. He\u2019s come to call it a discipline of holy interruption, which he\u2019s now extending into other parts of his life. He\u2019s using the notion of holy interruption as he works with his students in navigating new economic realities and prospects. In a course on human nature, for example, he uses scenes from the movie The Matrix. He challenges himself and his students to examine ways they are living virtually and not concretely and to take breaks from that, unplugging their cell phone batteries for 24 hours, for example. And beyond Lent, he\u2019s continuing to fast one day a week. I\u2019m spending a lot more of my excess \u2014 for example, the food money I save by not eating I\u2019m donating. I do weddings, so I ask people to donate any fees they might give to me to a local food bank called MANNA FoodBank. So it\u2019s little things like that that that\u2019s slowly letting creep in and interrupting the usual flow of basically how I see money. I believe the pressure from the economic crisis is certainly part of this, but since I\u2019ve been teaching this human nature course and Socrates for the last eight years, it\u2019s been doing this quiet number on me of examining your life and seeing The Matrix time and again and realizing that we are either agents or we are unplugged. And I don\u2019t like to think in such dualistic terms all the time, but it helps to make those stark contrasts so that we can check ourselves out to see if we are living an examined life or life that someone else has pretty much scripted out for us and we are just puppets at the end of someone else\u2019s strings. One of my students, her name is Miley, I was teaching the same course in Socrates about four years ago and talked about how the unexamined life is not worth living. And she said, thoughtfully, \u201CWell, Mullinax, if the unexamined is not worth living, does that mean that the examined life is worth dying for?\u201D And I just got goose bumps from that. And this is where my Christianity comes in. It\u2019s a matter of sacrifice for the greater good. The American dream that I grew up with, I think, is unsustainable. And I think we\u2019ve just learned how unsustainable it is in the United States of America, but I think the rest of the world has already known it to be an unsustainable effort, where 6 or 7 percent of the population can, year in, year out, consume 40 to 50 percent of the world\u2019s resources. That is just an unsustainable picture. So I think we\u2019re recognizing it maybe for the first time. And I call this a time of hope because as we are forced into a kind of Lent, as we are forced into these interruptions, maybe, just maybe there can be enough critical mass of people to see these as transforming times. That what we used to do really did not bring us closer together. It really didn\u2019t bring justice to everybody. It really didn\u2019t bring human rights or health care to everyone. It seemed to be a time of American dream for those who could purchase it. And maybe we will have an American dream that is more of a right, a human right, and not just an American purchase. Marc Mullinax of Asheville, North Carolina. Lia Hadley was born in Venezuela to Canadian parents. She grew up in Caracas, Grenada, Palo Alto, and Montreal. She\u2019s now settled in northern Germany with her husband and children. She began her conversation with us by noting that though she considers the present in moral and spiritual and not merely economic terms, she hesitates to use the word \u201Ccrisis.\u201D When I think of the word crisis, I always think it denotes something that we always think of as being short-term or coming unexpectedly or going away quickly. And I don\u2019t think that is going to happen in this case. Lia Hadley currently has work she loves at a computer science research institute on a project to implement digital media into K\u201312 classrooms, but she makes her living as a consultant and she is facing unemployment when this project ends. A dramatic downturn in her economic outlook actually came nine years ago with the IT crash of 2000, and she has been adjusting her understanding of work, money, community, and life ever since. I read recently that there are a hundred million photos that people can access and use on Flickr alone, and a hundred of my collages are a part of that hundred million. And I know, about two years ago or three years ago, when Kiva started \u2014 this as a microfinancing blog where you can \u2014 or a platform where, as individuals, you can contribute to entrepreneurs in third-world countries. So I helped this shop owner in Ukraine, and in the proceeding two or three years it came to a point where now I\u2019m setting up microfinance businesses with women in Kenya and Rwanda and Uganda and Cameroon. I just find that because of these people who have shown me that you don\u2019t have to be an expert or you don\u2019t have to be powerful or even necessarily particularly smart, everyone can just redefine what it is to live successfully in a community. My grandmother, she was the all-time community worker. She was this Irish Catholic woman living in Quebec, and of course the Church was bigger than politics. It was everything. And so her community was a church community. I mean, my community is literally the elderly neighbor living across the street or the young neighbor living in the orphanage in Kimilili, Kenya, that I\u2019m working together with. I mean, it can be very loose and broad.

What started out as an online project last fall has resulted in several radio programs, including this show with our listeners, but the conversation does not stop here. We\u2019ve crafted a dynamic map, weaving together a rich tapestry of stories and audio, images and geographies from the hundreds of people who have written to us, including a listener from Thailand who finds solace in the annual Thai celebration releasing paper lanterns with prayers. And Careen Stoll, a potter from Portland, Oregon, who says she feels needed as never before in this new economy.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, a new installment in our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue,\u201D bringing the voices of our listeners into a conversation we\u2019ve been building online and on air since economic downturn began in the fall of 2008. We\u2019ve been tracing the spiritual and moral contours of our economic present, how changed circumstances are confronting many of us with questions of what matters in life and what most deeply sustains us, what we are learning in this moment, and how we might live differently beyond it, shaping the next American dream. We heard from hundreds of listeners, often in the form of beautiful, thoughtful essays. We called people up at home or at work. We chose eight voices for this hour who put words around experiences many of us are having and who also impart some wisdom from their particular angle on life. Abeer Raazi of Columbus, Ohio, is just about to graduate from college with a degree in economics. He wrote this to us: \u201CI have seen problems looming for my generation grow from hurdles into mountains before my eyes: the tensing political and economic climate, the wracked Social Security system and my parents that it might not be providing for, the severe economic limitations of oil, water, and food. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m in over my head and the anxiety gets to me. These problems have really provoked me and have got me questioning many of the assumptions I was raised with.\u201D He continues, \u201CMy religion, Islam, teaches me to hold my material possessions in my hand and not my heart. It teaches me to count my wins and my losses as one, both important facets to a far more important journey.\u201D Abeer Raazi. So initially I was interested more in international relations and politics, and I thought the way to understand that best is to follow the money. And naturally that led me to economics. So when I started studying the discipline, I was pretty disappointed in that it didn\u2019t really shed much insight into what\u2019s happening in the world. It was very disconnected from real-world phenomena. And when you sort of tap into that economic world of academics and finance and corporations, then you understand what sort of principles are driving these people. And if you have a critical perspective, you see how that relates to society and politics. But you need that critical perspective to be able to do that, since the discipline it doesn\u2019t do it itself. As a Muslim, I naturally draw heavily from the Islamic tradition, and it\u2019s reflecting a lot on the Qur\u2019an, which heavily emphasizes the temporary nature of this life and death and preparation for the next life, which many of the spiritual traditions do. And I think associating that type of heavy spirituality with the founders of the discipline like Adam Smith and their ambition for social betterment \u2014 he\u2019s written quite a bit on that \u2014 and on social allocation. And he wrote in The Wealth of Nations often that the invisible hand that you hear of so often nowadays, it often fails and that we need to reconcile for these failures. And he acknowledged that. And he wrote an entire book on the theory of moral sentiments, which is an interesting secular book which creates a whole system of ethics which is forgotten in applying economics nowadays. And I think that\u2019s really sort of keeping that perspective on what\u2019s important and trying to apply the tools in that direction. That\u2019s some of the change we need to be making. Personally, I want to do something where I\u2019m changing communities. So there\u2019s a few things I want to learn about microfinance. In fact, I\u2019m going to be going to Pakistan in a few months to work with a microfinance organization so that\u2019s going to be an interesting experience. And specifically I\u2019d also like to study my religion a little more, Islamic intellectual tradition. It has a very strong intellectual tradition but it\u2019s been lost for, you can argue, several decades or a couple centuries. But it\u2019s certainly been lost, and I\u2019d like to get back in touch with the primary sources, the different ways they\u2019ve been applied to different times. Pakistan is probably \u2014 I think it is the first country where microfinance was started by a man named Akhtar Hameed Khan, and so it\u2019s being heavily applied there and a few successful models. And so I\u2019ll be going to work with a couple of those. In fact, they\u2019re applying it to cities. You often hear of microfinance being applied in rural areas, but it\u2019s working in some \u2014 they call it kachi abadi \u2014 the slums around the big cities. So I want to go see how that works. It\u2019s interesting, you know, now we see in America these tent cities popping up in Sacramento and it seems like things are just going to get worse, so this might be a tool we can even utilize here at home. Abeer Raazi of Columbus, Ohio. Ellen Williams was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer around the same time the economic crisis hit. Her medical bills skyrocketed, in other words, as her investment income dropped. As she\u2019s weathered these multiple crises, she\u2019s read widely and pondered questions of meaning. She\u2019s become increasingly aware, she wrote in her essay to us, of how we define ourselves in American society by signifiers, she calls them, of age, gender, accomplishments, education, and membership. She\u2019s intrigued by one of the questions we\u2019ve been posing to listeners these months. With the economic crisis in mind, who will we be for each other? But Ellen Williams insists that who we will be for each other will flow out of a more basic question: Who am I? Based on who I am, that is how I treat other people. And the basis of any spiritual discipline begins with compassion, kindness, fairness, and it seems to me that those virtues, those spiritual concepts, have been basically lost sight of lately. But the other aspect of that is when one has a personal crisis, whether it\u2019s caused by health or whether it\u2019s caused by economic loss or whatever, then you do have to ask yourself again, \u201CWell, who I am? How do I handle this based on who I am?\u201D If who I am is only what I own or it\u2019s only the amount of money that I\u2019ve saved and then lost, or the job I\u2019ve lost, if that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s grounding one\u2019s sort of faith on, then it really is a crisis. So even in the midst of my crisis \u2014which is a health crisis, but is also a financial crisis \u2014 I\u2019ve been lucky to still get very good care. I have to think, you know, what are the things that really sustain me? What are the things that are really important to me? And not only focus on whatever things that I have lost, whatever identity I might have lost through it. Ellen Williams is Episcopalian, and she\u2019s also been a practitioner of meditation across the years. She says that these dual traditions are helping her live through extremely difficult experiences in the spirit of one of her favorite poems by Wendell Berry. It is called \u201CThe Peace of Wild Things,\u201D and it goes like this: \u201CWhen despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound, in fear of what my life and my children\u2019s lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world and am free.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, our listeners reflect on \u201CLiving Differently, Beyond Economic Crisis,\u201D part of our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue.\u201D Oana Marian lives in Los Angeles. Her family immigrated to the U.S. from Romania when she was eight years old. Like so many of the people who wrote to us, our query about changed life in and beyond economic crisis spurred Oana Marian to write about humanity and community. She told of the generosity of one elementary school teacher in particular named Mary, who took her and her mother under her wing when they were settling in the U.S. and whose practical kindness has shaped the way she has lived ever since. Actually, the most poignant part of that story was my mom was sort of overwhelmed with a feeling of indebtedness, and Mary wrote my mother this note once that said, \u201CPlease don\u2019t ever say again how I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m every going to be able to repay you.\u201D She said, \u201CWhat else makes sense in this crazy world if we\u2019re not helping each other?\u201D So she just was kind of a genuine angel, and we\u2019re still friends with her. We have Christmas and Thanksgiving with her family every year. So what that means for me now is that \u2014 I\u2019ve moved around a lot in the last two years but wherever I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve tended to seek that. While I was in Italy, I met this chef who lives in Los Angeles and when I came back to L.A. a year and a half ago I started working for her as her personal assistant and also working at her restaurant. For me, working at that restaurant is like having a family in Los Angeles. That family at work is more important to Oana Marian than the salary she makes, she says, though it barely sustains her as she struggles to create a career as a filmmaker. She writes, \u201CI work in the film industry, an industry defined by uncertainty, risk, dreams, and largely egotistical ambitions. For the nonunion filmmaker there is no health insurance. Paid work comes unexpectedly or not at all. Rewarding work is sporadic. But great communities are possible as a result. There\u2019s a tenuous sense of meaning in all this, and I can honestly say that during the past five years I have had the fullest, most enriching experience of my life though I was broke or badly bent the majority of the time.\u201D Oana Marian. In some ways I feel what\u2019s going on in the world around me is somehow now matching the way that I have been living my life for a while. I mean, for my entire adult life. So it\u2019s hard for me to say that I\u2019m living any differently. But in some ways, there\u2019s some comfort knowing that more people are asking the same questions that I\u2019ve been asking all of these last years because I\u2019ve been living in kind of an insecure world of my own. And suddenly the cracks start to show. And then in some ways, you fee like, OK, I haven\u2019t been crazy this whole time. For example, maybe it\u2019s a silly example, but this overwhelming idea in Los Angeles that you can\u2019t get around without driving. Well, you can get around. There actually is the subway that most people who live here don\u2019t know about. There\u2019s public transportation. So even before the cracks started showing, to try to live in a simpler way even in a complicated environment, I think that this feeling that a lot of people have that suddenly everything is going to fall apart and there\u2019s nothing we can do, you know, there are very simple solutions. And I think that that\u2019s what happening more now as the structures that we trusted and that were the foundations of how we maneuvered our lives, that these are kind of falling apart. In some ways, I\u2019m hoping that one of the results of that is that people will realize the value of human relationships. And what it can mean to be in Los Angeles and to work at a restaurant like Angeli, that it\u2019s not about the money and that you have this community of people who will stand behind you and will be there and will come to your screening when you have your first movie out. This is what seems really necessary to me right now, is finding people who have the real ability to build a community. Oana Marian of Los Angeles, California. She concluded this essay to us with this sentence, which is counterintuitive, perhaps, in a moment of economic uncertainty but which echoes other younger people who wrote to us. \u201CIt is an exciting time to be alive. Almost overwhelmingly exciting.\u201D We hear finally from Jim King who lives in Telford, Pennsylvania, where he is president of an industrial scrap plastic recycling company. He finds sustenance in a weekly gathering of businessmen he attends where they have recently spent much time in discussion and supportive strategy on the repercussions of economic downturn both practical and personal. Jim King is also a devout Mennonite, and he routinely participates with his family in Mennonite social service projects. In response to our question about moral and spiritual aspects of economic crisis and how we might live differently in and beyond it, he sent this story. Several weeks ago I went with 12 other men to Benton, Kentucky, with our chainsaws to work with Mennonite disaster service, cleaning up properties for mostly elderly people who had been affected by a recent ice storm. I was asked by a local person there why we were doing this. Why did we come all the way from Pennsylvania to help them? I responded that back home our economy is not doing well either. In fact, several of the Amish men in my group were presently out of work because the construction industry is at a standstill. And since their companies were not expecting a bailout, why not use the time to go give someone else a bailout? What better stimulus is there than to help a neighbor in need, even if they are 800 miles away? To me, seeing the joy in an elderly person\u2019s face and listening to people\u2019s stories about the ice storm was ample reward. Hearing 12 chainsaws in a back yard is stimulus enough for me. I look at it as maybe we lost or ignored our spiritual compass. I think we assumed we had the right to drive whatever type of vehicle we chose, buy a house larger than we could afford, and then fill it with things we can barely use. So now we come to find out our environment can\u2019t take it anymore, and we can\u2019t afford the bills, either. I have to think back now when I was in Sunday school as a child, we used to sing that song. It went something like this: \u201CWise man built his house upon the rock. The wise man built his house upon the rock, and the rains came tumbling down.\u201D Then that song goes on to describe what happened to the foolish man who built his house upon the sand, and I think about now a lot of us are feeling a little foolish for what we had our faith in. I look back now and think of the times that we as a family worked in the garden, and this year I\u2019m planting a bigger garden. And I enjoy taking care of it anyway. I know that the food pantries in my community will need the extra food I have and it\u2019s a hobby. And also, I think as I look back on my childhood, I was raised in a family that we were taught to manage our money as children fairly well, and I want to work on that with my family, and sometimes that\u2019s a struggle. My son wants the same things that he sees other people have. And at the same time, I don\u2019t want to come across as being stingy. I want to be generous in an environment like this. The world needs people who are generous and willing to look out for each other. We\u2019ve had a family meeting at home a couple of times and have discussed how the world is different than it was in 2007 and what is it we\u2019re going to do about it. And a couple of those things was planting a bigger garden, turning off lights in a room if we\u2019re not using it. It has to be pretty simple, pretty basic. Otherwise, we lose sight of the bigger picture, or it seems like we\u2019re not making a difference anyway. And I\u2019m not only looking for leadership, but I think we have the challenge to be leaders. We have the challenge to find a new perspective that might challenge us to live differently. I see it as the beginning of a new American dream. This is now the opportunity for us to get it right.
