  "fullText": "I first discovered the philosopher of ecology Joanna Macy as a translator of the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. We take that exquisite poetry as a lens on Joanna Macy\u2019s wisdom \u2014 on the great dramas of our time \u2014 ecological, political, personal. Rilke sought the shape of meaning in a now-vanished central Europe at the turn of the last century. Joanna Macy\u2019s vision took shape in crucibles of the 20th century. I spoke with her in 2010. Now in her 80s, Joanna Macy says we are at a pivotal moment in history \u2014 with possibilities of unraveling, or of creating a life-sustaining human society. You\u2019re always asked to sort of stretch a little bit more, and actually, we\u2019re made for that. But in any case, there\u2019s absolutely no excuse for making our passionate love for our world dependent on what we think of its degree of health, whether we think it\u2019s going to go on forever. This moment, you\u2019re alive. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Joanna Macy has lived adventurously by any definition. She worked for the CIA in Cold War Germany. Then, as a young mother, she moved with her husband to post-colonial India, where he ran the newly-minted Peace Corps. There, she cared for Tibetan refugees, joining the young, newly exiled Dalai Lama. Later, she became an environmental activist \u2014 long before that term entered the global lexicon. Joanna Macy is best known today as a Buddhist, teacher, and scholar. So just as we start I would love \u2014 and this is where I start with everyone, whatever we\u2019re talking about. I\u2019d like to just ask you to talk a little bit about the spiritual and religious background of your childhood. Yeah. I grew up in a liberal Protestant family, where the church was very important because my grandfather was a Congregational preacher and so were his father and grandfathers on back. It skipped a generation with my father. At any rate, I was very familiar with the sounds and words and the great feeling of comfort. When we went to church as a child, people said nice things. They didn\u2019t argue, which was what was happening in my home. And I had, what we could say, a conversion experience, although I was already in the church. But Jesus and God became very personally alive for me when I was just turning 16 at a church camp, and I wanted to give my life to the church. But at that point, Krista, there was \u2014 it didn\u2019t even occur to me to enter the ministry. I was that much a child of my era. And so since I didn\u2019t even consider it, I was thinking of other ways like being a missionary or something. But when I studied and went into studies of biblical history and theology, I began to choke. I found that there was something that I balked at terrifically, which were creedal arguments about items of belief and also any hint of exclusivity that there were people beyond the pale. And so I walked out when I was 20, and it was a great hole in my life that opened up. And it was actually not until 15 years later when my young family and I were in the Peace Corps in India, and I began working with Tibetan refugees \u2014 that was the mid-\u201860s. I found a way of looking at the world through \u2014 I became so curious about what made these people so calm and radiant and unstoppable in preserving their tradition and in enjoying life. I do want to ask you just \u2014 you mentioned that there was a lot of arguing in your family, and your father was\u2026 \u2026tyrannical. \u2026was tyrannical. And yet, at the same time, you talk about poetry being part of your family, and that was also something that he kept alive. Yes. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And it seems to me that that was part of what could be very broadly described as your spiritual sensibility, also, from an early age. Would you say that? Yes, I would. And I would say, also, the summers that I spent at my paternal grandfather\u2019s farm in upstate New York \u2014 being in the fields, in the woods, around the barns felt so real and gave me a sense of that the world was very big and wise and intelligent, and that I had an appetite to disappear into it. And it was this streak of nature mysticism that made the summer months so much more vivid and real to me than the nine months I spent in New York City going to school. And I lived for that. There were hymns of St. Francis and others that \u2014 \u201COh, yeah. Yeah, this is my father\u2019s world.\u201D That was another hymn I loved that could lift me up. There was Jesus walking by the shores of Galilee. He was outdoors all the time too. That\u2019s true. You don\u2019t see him sitting in a pew or climbing up on a pulpit. He\u2019d climb up on a rock or walk along a sandy beach. And so\u2026 Yeah. As I said a minute ago, I first discovered you and learned about you as a translator of Rilke. And I wanted to try to take Rilke as a way into the life you\u2019ve lived, your approach to it, your way of seeing the world and seeing change in the world. What I\u2019d like to speak then of when we were living in Germany. My second son was born there. This was the 1950s. And one day, I walked into a bookstore on Adalbertstrasse near the university, and there on a table was this little sort of cloth-bound book in sort of rag paper. It was exquisite. It was Das Stunden-Buch, The Book of Hours. And I picked it up and the poem that it opened to was the second poem of the first part, \u201CIch lebe mein Leben in wachsenden Ringen,\u201D \u201CI live my life in widening circles.\u201D And that something immediately rearranged in the furniture of my mind. I identified completely with it and I saw \u2014 it was just eight lines in that poem \u2014 that it could redefine that I was on a spiritual path. So this was the 1950s, right? Is that what you said when you discovered Rilke? Yes. And at that time, you had a very interesting early adventure with the CIA. Were you doing that at that point? That\u2019s right. See I had \u2014 when I dropped theology and Christianity, my impulse \u2014 I had a very strong impulse toward service, so I thought I would serve politically. And I got a Fulbright scholarship to the Institut de Sciences Politiques, political science, in France. And there, I studied the French Communist Party. And that made me very interesting to CIA. I was all of 21, 22 at the time and still very wet behind the ears. And so when CIA dangled a glamorous job in front of my nose, I fell for it and went and worked for them for about two years. But, you know, Krista, I want to read the poem I mentioned. Oh, good. I\u2019d love for you to read it. So as I stood there having an exciting life but still wishing that I were on a spiritual path \u2014 and what was there for me if I couldn\u2019t stomach the church fathers in Christianity and the arcane theological arguments? And then I read this. So I\u2019ll say it in English. I live my life in widening circles that reach out across the world. I may not complete this last one but I give myself to it. I circle around God, around the primordial tower. I\u2019ve been circling for thousands of years and I still don\u2019t know: am I a falcon, a storm, or a great song? The constrictions that my culture had made around the sacred \u2014 it just fell away like dried crusts. And I felt an excitement about being alive now in a world that itself \u2014 yes, of course, it was \u2014 my world itself is sacred. And then when you went to India \u2014 had you had an encounter with Buddhism? Did you know much about Buddhism before you\u2026? Not really. No. Which was quite wonderful because it was before Buddhism was sweeping the West. Really came over to the West, right. And you came to Buddhism in India as opposed to discovering it over here. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And I was bent on \u2014 I fell in love with these Tibetans who were living in very harsh circumstances up in the foothills of the Himalayas after these incredibly strenuous, and often with loss of life, and great danger, and sick-making escapes over the peaks and passes out of Tibet. The way they loved life and the way they loved their tradition in a very open-hearted way, I wanted to know what helped them be like that. So that was a turning point in my life. It\u2019s interesting too that you were drawn to that tradition as a lived expression long before you actually got into the beliefs or the teachings behind it. Yeah. And I was primed for it because I had read Heinrich Harrer\u2019s My Seven Years in Tibet. And I had read it in German, its original language. And I had actually \u2014 I was going to interpreter\u2019s school in Munich my last year, and I used that text for my simultaneous interpreting exercises that I would read it and render it in English without a pause. So that book really got into my brain cells, in my head, and in my heart. So that when I was actually among the Tibetans and in the presence of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, a young man then, I certainly had a sense of d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu. And as you point out in some of your writing, there are real echoes and resonance between some of Rilke\u2019s poetry about God and Buddhist teachings and notions about reality that are very interesting. Yes, yes. It\u2019s just amazing to me that he refers to, early on in his Stunden-Buch, The Book of Hours, he said, \u201CWe must not portray you in King\u2019s robes, you drifting mist that brought forth the morning.\u201D And then he says, \u201CYou are like a web or you are like a tree or you are a forest through which I run, or you are a herd of luminous deer and I am forest and dark and you run through me.\u201D So he\u2019s using image after image from the natural world to convey that both the mystery and the beauty and the relationship that we find in the sacred. And he addresses this sacred as God, but it\u2019s a God that is very different from the one he had been dragged into Catholic churches with his super-pious mother in Prague as a boy. He hated that. She had him touch the painted wounds on the crucifix to arouse his compassion, and he found all that too repulsive. But then when he went, interestingly enough, in his early 20s to Russia with his wonderful lover, Lou Andreas-Salom\u00E9, who was from St. Petersburg, he encountered Russian spirituality, which is very close to the earth. And that opened up to him a quality of spiritual experience that was very earth-related and vast and timeless. Here\u2019s one of my favorite Rilke poems about God: God speaks to each of us as he makes us, then walks with us silently out of the night. These are the words we dimly hear: You, sent out beyond your recall, go to the limits of your longing. Embody me. Flare up like a flame and make big shadows I can move in. Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final. Don\u2019t let yourself lose me. Nearby is the country they call life. You will know it by its seriousness. Give me your hand. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Rilke translator and Buddhist philosopher of ecology, Joanna Macy. Something that\u2019s very intriguing to me is that you were talking about the environment, and I think maybe \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if you called yourself an environmental activist, but being one way before that was something that so many people are talking about. That\u2019s true. Tell me about how that awakening came in your life. Well, it came about very naturally. I was always responsive to issues when they arose. And then in the \u201870s, it became quite vivid for me and quite compelling as through my son \u2014 my second son \u2014 through a papery road in his environmental engineering course at college that I learned about what nuclear power generation was doing in even the thermal pollution, let alone the radioactive contamination. And so, side by side with him, I stepped into direct activism, going together to occupy the Seabrook reactor before it could open and protesting down at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I learned piles there. And that had a great spiritual teaching for me too, Krista, because it led me into fascination, if not obsession \u2014 I\u2019ll say obsession \u2014 with long-term radioactive contamination through our processes of making weapons and generating power that insisted that I open my mind to reaches of time that had stretched both my heart and my intellect. In other words, I realized that we were, through technology, having consequences with \u2014 our decisions had consequences or a karma, as we could say, that reached into geological time. And that what in industry and government choices that we make under pressure for profit or bureaucratic whatever, that we are making choices that will affect whether beings thousands of generations from now will be able to be born sound of mind and body. Something that\u2019s very present for me as I\u2019m reading about you and the passion you\u2019ve had for this for a long time is you also were always very aware of a sense of grief as you realized\u2026 Oh, yeah. Grief got me into it. Yeah. And I think that right now, say right now in this moment as we\u2019re speaking in 2010, the spectacle that\u2019s very present for people, maybe more in the forefront \u2014 certainly more in the forefront of peoples\u2019 minds than nuclear power or nuclear weapons were in the \u201970s \u2014 is the Gulf oil spill, right? Oh, yes. Right. And there is this grief about that. And you really work with people to hold on to that, to take their grief seriously, right? Or not to hold on to it so much as to not be afraid of it because that grief, if you are afraid of it and pave it over, clamp down, you shut down. And the kind of apathy and closed-down denial, our difficulty in looking at what we\u2019re doing to our world stems not from callous indifference or ignorance so much as it stems from fear of pain. That was a big learning for me as I was organizing around nuclear power and around at the time of Three Mile Island catastrophe and around Chernobyl. And so it relates to everything. It relates to what\u2019s in our food, and it relates to the clear-cuts of our forests. It relates to the contamination of our rivers and oceans. So that became, actually, perhaps the most pivotal point in \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 the landscape of my life, that dance with despair, to see how we are called to not run from the discomfort and not run from the grief or the feelings of outrage or even fear and that, if we can be fearless, to be with our pain, it turns. It doesn\u2019t stay static. It only doesn\u2019t change if we refuse to look at it. But when we look at it, when we take it in our hands, when we can just be with it and keep breathing, then it turns. It turns to reveal its other face, and the other face of our pain for the world is our love for the world, our absolutely inseparable connectedness with all life. And I think again, in even thinking that way, that a poetic mindset is more useful than the kind of fact-based, right, or argument-based way we tend to approach problems culturally, even precisely the same ecological problems? Oh, yeah. That keeps people from even mentioning how distressed they are because they think that they need to have all the facts and figures and statistics to show that they intellectually can master the problem instead of just\u2026 Yeah. But we get overwhelmed by the facts, and the figures, and the pictures. They are debilitating. They\u2019re paralyzing. As you say, it\u2019s also that we don\u2019t really know how to dwell with grief and turn it into something else. But I think about that a lot as a journalist, as somebody who works in media. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. It\u2019s a double-edged sword, isn\u2019t it? Because you want to portray \u2014 say you\u2019re taking care of your mother, and she\u2019s dying of cancer. And you say, \u201CI can\u2019t go in her house or in her room because I don\u2019t want to look at her.\u201D But if you love her, you want to be with her. If we love our world, we\u2019re able to see the scum of oil spreading across the Gulf. We\u2019re able to see what it\u2019s doing to the wetlands and the marshes, what it\u2019s doing to the dolphins and the gulls. When you love something, your love doesn\u2019t say, \u201CWell, too bad my kid has leukemia, so I won\u2019t go near her.\u201D It\u2019s just the opposite. What is empowering in moments like that? And I wonder if Rilke comes to mind again, of how he was very clear about darkness as a part of life. Yes. There\u2019s a poem that has been \u2014 it\u2019s a sonnet and the very last \u201CSonnet to Orpheus\u201D that has entered my bloodstream that has helped me a great deal in this time. I will say it. Quiet friend who has come so far, feel how your breathing makes more space around you. Let this darkness be a bell tower and you the bell. As you ring, what batters you becomes your strength. Move back and forth into the change. What is it like, such intensity of pain? If the drink is bitter, turn yourself to wine. In this uncontainable night, be the mystery at the crossroads of your senses, the meaning discovered there. And if the world has ceased to hear you, say to the silent earth: I flow. To the rushing water, speak: I am. I have been emailing this Rilke poem to friends ever since Joanna Macy recited it for me. And you can too \u2014 download this and the others she read for us at onbeing.org. There, you can also listen again and share this conversation with Joanna Macy. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with philosopher of ecology and Buddhist scholar, Joanna Macy. Now in her 80s, she worked with the CIA in Cold War Europe and the Peace Corps in post-colonial India. She was an environmental activist long before this term entered our cultural imagination in any mainstream way. And she brings a poetic and spiritual sensibility to this. It\u2019s reflected in her translations, together with Anita Barrows, of the early-20th-century poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Joanna Macy believes we are in a moment she calls \u201CThe Great Turning\u201D \u2014 a transition from society shaped primarily by industrial growth to a society structured to be life-sustaining. She finds nourishment for this vision in Rilke. He also chronicled a turn-of-century, world-altering moment in time. Talk to me about where these kinds of insights have brought you. you have had this fascinating life, and we talked about the \u201850s and \u201860s and \u201870s, and you were always responding and being with what was happening. How do those words of Rilke speak to what\u2019s happening in this early 21st century that we\u2019re in now? Well, from the beginning, Rilke, in his first poems that he stayed loyal to in the Book of Hours, he foresaw \u2014 he had this strong inkling, and he gave visions, metaphors, and images to it that this 20th century that was opening up would be very dark. He didn\u2019t know about the world wars. He didn\u2019t know about the concentration camps, the death camps, the nuclear bombings. He didn\u2019t know about the new diseases and epidemics. But he did sense that. And some of his poems are as if he\u2019s consoling God for what\u2019s happened to his creation. And there\u2019s a poem where he says \u2014 God becomes the earth itself, and he speaks to the earth: \u201CDu dunkelnder Grund\u2026\u201D Dear darkening ground, you\u2019ve endured so patiently the walls we built, please give the cities one more hour and the churches and cloisters two. And those that labor \u2014 let their toils still hold them for another five hours, or seven, before that hour of inconceivable terror when you take back your name from all things. Just give me a little more time! I just need a little more time. Because I am going to love the things as no one has thought to love them, until they\u2019re real and worthy of you. So I feel like that. I\u2019m ready to see. I\u2019m not insisting that we be brimming with hope. It\u2019s OK not to be optimistic. Buddhist teachings say feeling that you have to maintain hope can wear you out. So just be present. That\u2019s good. Yes. The biggest gift you can give is to be absolutely present, and when you\u2019re worrying about whether you\u2019re hopeful, or hopeless, or pessimistic, or optimistic, who cares? The main thing is that you\u2019re showing up, that you\u2019re here, and that you\u2019re finding ever more capacity to love this world because it will not be healed without that. That was what is going to unleash our intelligence and our ingenuity and our solidarity for the healing of our world. So that is what keeps me going, Krista. The Great Turning is a revolution that is underway, the transition to a life-sustaining society, that this is sprouting up in countless ways, new ways of holding the land, new ways of generating energy, new ways of producing food, some of them very old ways that we are going back to, wisdom of the ancestors and of the indigenous people, often, new ways of measuring prosperity and wealth, new ways of handling differences through nonviolent communication, through restorative circles instead of outside the dominant punitive penal system now. There\u2019s a tremendous energy. Right. When you add all that up, you do see a picture or two. Oh, yeah. Now, something else is going on too, which is the great unraveling under the pressure of the destruction caused by the industrial growth society. And the awesome thing about the moment that you and I share is that we don\u2019t know which is going to win out. How is the story going to end? And that seems almost orchestrated to bring forth from us the biggest moral strength, courage, and creativity, I feel. Because when things are this unstable, a person\u2019s determination, how they choose to invest their energy, and their heart, and mind can have much more effect on the larger picture than we\u2019re accustomed to think. So I find it a very exciting time to be alive, if somewhat wearing emotionally. Is there any Rilke that comes to mind on these big ideas? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Tell me what comes to mind. Oh, \u201CAll will come again into its strength.\u201D Let me see if I can find that. I\u2019m trying to remember \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading my \u2014 pulling out my Rilke as I was planning to read you. There were a couple of lines that just were so haunting to me. Yes? I can\u2019t find them. And it\u2019s something about \u2014 it\u2019s the end of a poem. And it\u2019s something about \u2014 in the ephemeral nature of things is their very fragrance. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? Yes. Which sounds so much like he was a Buddhist. Yeah. But it was so beautiful, so beautiful. This runs through Rilke\u2019s Sonnets to Orpheus. \u201CSong itself cannot happen without time, without the voice rising and falling away\u201D \u2014 and I love it that you remembered that line \u2014 \u201CFor is not impermanence the very fragrance of our days.\u201D \u201CIs not impermanence the very fragrance of our days.\u201D Right. Yeah. I just want to kind of underline the connection that you repeatedly make that I think might be counterintuitive. You talk about spirituality, and you are also always equally talking about \u2014 these are some phrases from your writing that echo things you said. Your wild love for the world or even an erotic connection with the world \u2014 that those two things go together for you. Yeah. That\u2019s right. World is lover. World is self. And that it\u2019s OK for our hearts to be broken over the world. What else is a heart for? There\u2019s a great intelligence there. We\u2019ve been treating the Earth as if it were a supply house and a sewer. We\u2019ve been grabbing, extracting resources from it for our cars and our hair dryers and our bombs, and we\u2019ve been pouring the waste into it until it\u2019s overflowing. But our Earth is not a supply house and a sewer. It is our larger body. We breathe it. We taste it. We are it. And it is time now that we venerate that incredible flowering of life that takes every aspect of our physicality. So when I \u2014 I\u2019m looking at my hand right now as we talk. It\u2019s got a lot of wrinkles because I\u2019m 81 years old, but it\u2019s linked to hands like this back through the ages. This hand is directly linked to hands that learned to reach and grasp and climb and push up on dry land and weave reeds into baskets, and it has a fantastic history. Every particle and every atom in this hand goes back to the beginning of space-time. We\u2019re part of that story. That actually gets at something I wanted to ask you about your sense of time, but I came at that with a much more narrow imagination. I was thinking about the history you\u2019ve seen \u2014 the political history you\u2019ve seen, how that India you lived in the 1960s is now transformed. In many ways, it\u2019s a rising star in a globalized economy. How that East Germany where you watched the uprising in Hungary, how the Berlin Wall fell\u2026 So you have a globalized culture extending over all of it with a monoculture, in a way, that is wiping out ancient cultures and languages. Is that what you see? Yeah, that\u2019s what I see. And at the same time, there\u2019s this incredible linking. And there is, right here in my neighborhood, a group of young women who have created an organization where they work on appropriate technology with women in India and in Africa. Do you have the sense I have \u2014 you\u2019re 81; I\u2019m 49. But I have a sense also that there\u2019s an intuition in the blood and bones of young people, of new generations coming up, that they inhabit this reality, right? That they know it in a way that I never will. I wonder\u2026 It\u2019s amazing. You have grandchildren. And they\u2019re able to look into the face of some pretty awful political corrupt machinations, or what have you, that would get me frothing with righteous indignation, and they smile and shrug and say, \u201CWhat do you expect?\u201D And then they go and do what needs to be done. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Rilke translator and Buddhist philosopher of ecology Joanna Macy. I was noticing one of your most recent books, I think, is more Rilke, which you titled In Praise of Mortality. You wrote, \u201CRilke invites us to experience what mortality makes possible. It links us with life and all time.\u201D And you went on, \u201COurs is the suffering and ours is the harvest.\u201D I wonder, at 81, is there wisdom you have about that? Well, I\u2019m very grateful for Rilke because I signed the contract to prepare with Anita the Year with Rilke just weeks before the sudden death of my husband of 56 years. In that devastation and loss, I had to work on this book, and I had to be with Rilke. And I couldn\u2019t say, \u201COh, I\u2019m too weak. Oh, let me mourn. Oh, it\u2019s too much.\u201D I just had to pull up my socks and do it. And what a reward. It was as if I were being dipped in beauty. And then one day, I found this quote. And I put it in the book because he says a lot about death and the way he faced his death. And he did not take solace in an afterlife. So he just saw death belongs to life and can make us more alive. But, Krista, listen to this. I put it on February 27th. \u201CThe great secret of death, and perhaps its deepest connection with us, is this: in taking from us a being we have loved and venerated, death does not wound us without, at the same time, lifting us toward a more perfect understanding of this being and of ourselves.\u201D Get a load of that. And they\u2019re beautiful words, and were you really able to inhabit those words after your husband had died? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, neither of us thought we were immortal. And we knew one would go first. I\u2019m everlastingly grateful that we were in love and stayed in love. Particularly, it was like falling in love all over again in our later years, so there was a lot of cherishing. But I found that that quote that I just read you \u2014 and it\u2019s really engraved in the inside of my head \u2014 is true. It\u2019s true, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re changing all the time. He\u2019s part of my world now. You become what you love. Orpheus became the world that Rilke sang to, and my husband, Fran, is spread out in this world that he loved. So there\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re always asked to sort of stretch a little bit more, but actually we\u2019re made for that. There\u2019s a song that wants to sing itself through us, and we\u2019ve just got to be available. Maybe the song that is to be sung through us is the most beautiful requiem for an irreplaceable planet or maybe it\u2019s a song of joyous rebirth as we create a new culture that doesn\u2019t destroy its world. But in any case, there\u2019s absolutely no excuse for making our passionate love for our world dependent on what we think of its degree of health, whether we think it\u2019s going to go on forever. Those are just thoughts anyway. But this moment, you\u2019re alive. So you can just dial up the magic of that at any time. Here, in closing, is a poem from Rilke\u2019s Book of Hours, which Joanna Macy translated with Anita Barrows and subtitled Love Poems to God. You are not surprised at the force of the storm\u2014 you have seen it growing. The trees flee. Their flight sets the boulevards streaming. And you know: he whom they flee is the one you move toward. All your senses sing him, as you stand at the window. The weeks stood still in summer. The trees\u2019 blood rose. Now you feel it wants to sink back into the source of everything. You thought you could trust that power when you plucked the fruit: now it becomes a riddle again and you again a stranger. Summer was like your house: you know where each thing stood. Now you must go out into your heart as onto a vast plain. Now the immense loneliness begins. The days go numb, the wind sucks the world from your senses like withered leaves. Through the empty branches the sky remains. It is what you have. Be earth now, and evensong. Be the ground lying under that sky. Be modest now, like a thing ripened until it is real, so that he who began it all can feel you when he reaches for you. Joanna Macy\u2019s books include Active Hope: How to Face the Mess We\u2019re in Without Going Crazy. Her wonderful books of Rilke translation, together with Anita Barrows, include Rilke\u2019s Book of Hours: Love Poems to God, A Year with Rilke, and the recently re-released In Praise of Mortality. Here, she is reciting one last Rilke poem. You can read and download all the poems Joanna Macy recited this hour at onbeing.org. The poem for today in A Year with Rilke is \u201CThe Swan.\u201D When I opened it this morning and saw that, I was delighted because when I\u2019ve seen swans, they always make me think of Fran. And it\u2019s also about death and about how not to be afraid of death. This laboring of ours with all that remains undone, as if still bound to it, is like the lumbering gait of the swan. And then our dying\u2014releasing ourselves from the very ground on which we stood\u2014 is like the way he hesitantly lowers himself into the water. It gently receives him, and, gladly yielding, flows back beneath him, as wave follows wave, while he, now wholly serene and sure, with regal composure, allows himself to glide. So as I read that sonnet this morning, I thought of Fran. And I thought, \u201COh, look at you getting to have some regal composure while I have to deal with a broken car, with books I have to cull out, with repairs to the heating system.\u201D There he goes, regal composure.
