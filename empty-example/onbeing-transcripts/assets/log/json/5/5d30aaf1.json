  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, a radio pilgrimage to L\u2019Arche\u2014a community formed around people with mental disabilities, and others who share life with them. At the heart of the L\u2019Arche movement is a countercultural idea of difference as normal and imperfection as a source of strength. What I\u2019ve experienced in L\u2019Arche has been many times that beauty of things that go wrong even, or that don\u2019t go according to the way we would like them to or according to our plan, but they\u2019re still wonderful. And that\u2019s the charism of L\u2019Arche. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us for \u201CL\u2019Arche: A Community of Brokenness and Beauty.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. The L\u2019Arche movement is named in the French tongue of its birthplace. It means \u201Cthe ark,\u201D an old image of all the parts of creation journeying together. In this movement that spans 34 countries, community is formed around people with mental disabilities. Today we\u2019ll revisit our radio pilgrimage into the world of L\u2019Arche\u2014its rhythms of life, its openness to pain and failing, and its habits of love and forgiveness. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CL\u2019Arche: A Community of Brokenness and Beauty.\u201D Yeah. \u2026you going to write\u2014you going to write yours down in your book? How\u2019d you do at work? Whoa, 650 bags! Yes! Increasingly in our culture, the word \u201Ccommunity\u201D is an offshoot of identity politics. It is used to group people who think or act alike. But at the heart of L\u2019Arche is a countercultural idea of difference as normal and imperfection as a source of strength. One of the realities we\u2019re all called to go through, in those words of Mother Teresa, \u201Cto move from repulsion to compassion, and compassion to wonderment.\u201D Jean Vanier founded L\u2019Arche in 1964. He had been a British naval officer and then a professor of philosophy in Canada. At Christmastime in 1963, he visited a friend, a Dominican monk working as a chaplain in a small French institution for men with mental handicaps. The world of the handicapped, he says, was new to him, and yet he found himself deeply moved by the friendship and the quality of spiritual openness in these men who were shut away from society. Jean Vanier began to visit other institutions. At a vast asylum south of Paris, he encountered a concrete prison in which, all day, 80 adult men did nothing but walk around in circles and take a two-hour compulsory nap. \u201CThere I was struck by the screams and the atmosphere of sadness,\u201D he would later write, \u201Cbut also by a mysterious presence of God.\u201D Jean Vanier bought a small house nearby and invited two men from that asylum to come share life with him. Philippe and Raphael were the founding members of a movement which now has 133 communities around the world, including men and women from many backgrounds, religions, and cultures. Here\u2019s Jean Vanier speaking at St. John\u2019s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, about an experience he had at the original L\u2019Arche community in France. I don\u2019t know whether around here you have some normal people, but I find them a very strange group. I don\u2019t know\u2014I remember\u2014well, one of the characteristics of normal people is that they have problems. They have family problems, they have financial problems, they have professional problems, problems with politics, problems with church, problems all over the place. And I remember one very normal guy came to see me and he was telling me about all his problems. And there was a knock on the door, and entered Jean Claude. Jean Claude has Down Syndrome and, relaxed and laughing, and he just shook\u2014I didn\u2019t even say, \u201CCome in.\u201D He came in, and he shook my hand and laughed and he shook the hand of Mr. Normal and laughed and he walked out laughing. And Mr. Normal turned to me and he said, \u201CIsn\u2019t it sad, children like that.\u201D He couldn\u2019t see that Jean Claude was a happy guy. It\u2019s a blindness, and it\u2019s an inner blindness which is the most difficult to heal. L\u2019Arche founder Jean Vanier. Most of the 16 L\u2019Arche communities in the United States are in major cities. The community in Clinton, Iowa, was founded in 1974, one of the first, and still the most rural. It took the name The Arch, seeing itself as a bridge between two worlds. With a population of 29,000, Clinton sits along a gorgeous stretch of the upper Mississippi. Its solid red brick buildings and graceful houses tell of an affluent past, as do the busy rail lines, whose whistles sound in The Arch homes many times daily. From a genesis of two people in 1974, The Arch in Clinton has grown to three houses and several apartments. Today, 19 mentally retarded residents and nine non-disabled assistants live within walking distance of each other in a pleasant, leafy neighborhood close to the river. Jo Anne Horstmann was director of the Clinton Arch for 12 years. She\u2019s now regional coordinator for the L\u2019Arche federation in the central U.S., which includes communities in five states. In L\u2019Arche we talk about the rhythm of our day, to have a balance between rest and work and prayer, solitude and community. It\u2019s like a symphony, you know? Everybody knows their part and they play it well and they make beautiful music together. At every L\u2019Arche home the mentally disabled residents are the core members, and the non-disabled are their assistants. I asked Jo Anne Horstmann a simple question, \u201CWho lives here?\u201D She gave me long and vivid descriptions of each core member. Here are just a few. They all have their distinctions that make them unique in all the world, you know? Mary Pat moved in a year ago, and she\u2019s our newest core member. And Mary Pat lived with her mom all of her life. Mary Pat\u2019s 50 years old. And my understanding is that Mary Pat, when she was, like, a teenager, developed rheumatic fever. And she went out before that time, but after the rheumatic fever, her mom, out of love, kept her at home. And it was because that\u2019s what her mom knew to do. That was the best thing that her mom could do for her. So she moved in, and has just had this new world opened up to her. And Mary Pat talks, and she does really well at work. She goes to church, she goes shopping. She\u2019s in California today. She went on a plane. You know, she\u2019s in California right now on a retreat with Jean Vanier. And that\u2019s what L\u2019Arche is all about, to become home and family for people like Mary Pat. Then there\u2019s Bob, and he lived in an institution from the time he was 10, so about 40 years of his life. Because Bob really doesn\u2019t have a family, everybody is his brother and sister. Like, he loves sports, and he\u2019ll be watching a baseball team and he\u2019ll say \u201CThat\u2019s my brother, that is,\u201D you know? Or \u201CShe\u2019s my sister.\u201D And so everybody kind of becomes Bob\u2019s brother and sister. And he kind of, you know, the blood thing doesn\u2019t matter to him, it\u2019s more of a spirit thing and a kindred spirit that he feels with people. Janice has lived at The Arch for 20 years. And, you know, Janice is another person who just makes everybody feel welcome. She loves to cook. She likes to check out all the cookbooks at the library. Yeah. She always has a great big bear hug for people, gives them little adjustments. Victor. Victor came in 1981. Like, with Victor, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to understand him. But what Victor teaches me is that presence is the most important gift that you can give someone. And he also teaches me the importance of touch. Because with Victor, you know, we can be sitting side-by-side, and he\u2019ll be talking to me and I\u2019m not understanding a word that he says, but when he holds my hand I know what he\u2019s talking about, you know? And Victor\u2019s a very gentle person, too, you know? Just, we talk about the gifts of the Holy Spirit and one being gentleness. You know, all of our people seem to have that gift of the Holy Spirit, is that gentleness. Oh, yeah. We\u2019ll cut the tags off of it. That\u2019d be a good idea. Mm-hmm. We don\u2019t want you to look like a Minnie Pearl. There were two people who came shortly after I did in 1989, and Dan is one of those two people. And Dan will tell you\u2014if you met him last night and if you were to have driven your car over there, then today he could tell you\u2014he would tell everybody what kind of car you drove because he\u2019s really big on cars and he can remember\u2014like, if you would come back 20 years from now he\u2019ll remember you and he\u2019ll remember the car that you drove. Dan\u2019s dream is to drive a car some day. He would like to take the driver\u2019s test, and that\u2019s kind of his dream. And what he likes to do in his spare time is go around to car lots. He likes to look at cars. And he has a Matchbox car collection and he spends a lot of time with it. These are my cars and trucks and vans and Jeeps. Corvette, Porsche, Corvette, Firebird, Porsche, Mercedes. This one car I see coming on the road is a Dodge Viper, Dodge Van, a Ram Charger and a Dodge Ram pickup truck, too, Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck. I see every single one of them coming. There\u2019s John. And John lived with his mom, but John, you know, always talked about wanting to live at The Arch, and so one day his mom decided, \u2018You know, I think it\u2019s time.\u2019 She was getting older, and she wanted to see John in a home before something happened to her. And so I was outside of Arch 3 when the assistant had come with John and his belongings. And I heard Johnny yelling out the car window, \u201CThe Arch, my new home! The Arch, my new home!\u201D Like, I know people down the block could have heard him because he was just so excited about The Arch being his new home. : Oh, my name is Chris Bruin, and this is my friend, John. Yeah. And we share a home with six people in our community, don\u2019t we? My honey. OK. Oh, what do you like to do when you come home at night after work? I like Elvis. You like Elvis, don\u2019t you? And what do you like to play with Elvis? I play \u201CLove Me Tender.\u201D \u201CLove Me Tender.\u201D But you also like to play your guitar, don\u2019t you? Yeah. And sometimes I play the drums with you, don\u2019t I? I love it. Oh, yeah. Oh, you saw a play about Elvis, didn\u2019t you? Yeah, I like him. Elvis impersonators. And then we also went to Rock Island and saw a fellow who was a very good Elvis impersonator, huh? Ooh, I loved that. Yeah, he was really good. He did all his own singing, and\u2026 Hey, I helped him, too. Yeah, you got up there with him and you had your Elvis outfit on, didn\u2019t you? Yeah. I love it. Mm-hmm. I love you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, a radio pilgrimage to \u201CL\u2019Arche: A Community of Brokenness and Beauty.\u201D Jo Anne Horstmann began her career as a physical education teacher, and she discovered that she loved working with disabled children. She especially enjoyed their delight in accomplishments which for the rest of us would be routine: skipping ropes, catching a ball. Later, she worked part time in a group home for handicapped children and adolescents. She came to The Arch in Clinton in 1989. I asked Jo Anne Horstmann what distinguishes The Arch from any very good group home. Our assistants make their home with people who are handicapped. It\u2019s not an eight-hour type of job where you come in in the morning and leave in the afternoon, or come in in the evening and leave in the early morning. And also, like, when people come to, quote, \u201Cwork\u201D at The Arch, it\u2019s more seen as a lifestyle than a job. Really, our life is made up of just very simple things. I mean, our daily life is about cooking and cleaning. And, you know, it\u2019s not what the world would see as very high and lofty, but it\u2019s about the amount of love that we put in what we do that makes it a profound experience. Who made the coleslaw? I know. Eric Plaut. Marion. It looks great. Yeah. I don\u2019t think most people use the words \u201Cmentally retarded\u201D anymore. How do you think about that whole subject of language and how you would describe or define the condition of the core members? Oh, it\u2019s certainly a difficult issue today. I think that, you know, we try to change words to stay away from the word \u201Cretarded\u201D because of how the word has been used in our elementary days, you know? I always say that, you know, in music we use the word retarded to slow down. It means \u201Cto slow down.\u201D Nothing wrong. We don\u2019t take it out of our music sheets. And in L\u2019Arche, we use \u201Ccore members\u201D because we say that our folks are the center of what we live. You know, life revolves around them. They are the core members of the community. I could imagine that there are good programs, but where they don\u2019t, maybe, imagine that mentally handicapped people are capable of the depth of spiritual life that is evident here. I think that\u2019s true, and I think it\u2019s probably because the way we live draws it out of them and we recognize it, you know, and we call it to attention. We don\u2019t try to avoid it or put it aside, you know? It\u2019s actually a point of the way we live at The Arch and in L\u2019Arche. Our core members teach us to have that complete faith and trust in God and not complicate it, as we can do. Lord, help us. All people go to heaven like Jesus said, brothers and sisters, cousins, the friends. Lord, help us Arch nurse and doctor and people are healthy. Lord, help us sit down at the table morning, noon, and night, singing in joy and love. Lord, help us Arch people go to bed, go to bed, prayer, wake up at sunshine. Lord, hear our prayer. Lord, hear our prayer. Here again is Jean Vanier, founder of the L\u2019Arche movement. Just recently in Central America I was visiting an institution where there were 200 people with disabilities. And to tell you frankly, I was almost physically sick. I think I\u2019ve become much more vulnerable in front of places where people are not respected as human beings, where they\u2019re crushed, where there\u2019s no more dialogue. We all have to reflect on how we\u2019re in front of pain. We\u2019re all running away from it, we can\u2019t stand it, we don\u2019t know what to do with it. We don\u2019t know what to do with the beggar crying out. We find all sorts of reasons for not to look at him. And the whole question is how to stand before pain. What we say that we want to be, and what I think that we are, is we want to be a sign of hope. In the charter of L\u2019Arche we say that, you know, we can\u2019t serve every person with a mental handicap. We\u2019re not out to be a solution for anything, but more of a sign. You know, our visitors are really important, our pilgrims are very important to us because we live this every day, and we can tend to think there\u2019s nothing extraordinary about what we do. When our pilgrims come in\u2014I like that term\u2014you know, they tell us that we\u2019re living something that\u2019s very unique and very different. And so a lot of times at the end of the week, they\u2019re telling about this wonderful experience that they\u2019ve had and we\u2019re sitting around thinking \u2018Wow. Where were we?\u2019 You know, to know that what we\u2019re living and how we\u2019re living, it has a profound effect on hundreds of people. You know, and that\u2019s where the sign of hope comes in. Jo Anne Horstmann coordinates the L\u2019Arche communities in the central United States. This is Speaking of Faith.

Welcome back to Speaking of Faith , public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CA Community of Brokenness and Beauty,\u201D we\u2019re revisiting our radio pilgrimage to the L\u2019Arche community in Clinton, Iowa, which is known as The Arch. The first L\u2019Arche home was founded in France in 1964 by Jean Vanier, a naval officer-turned-philosopher who discovered spiritual friendship in people with mental handicaps. There are now over 133 L\u2019Arche communities in 34 countries. Mentally handicapped adults, known as core members, share a life here with non-handicapped adults called their assistants. What are you going to do tomorrow? What am I going to do tomorrow? Yeah. Well, I might mow the yard if it\u2019s not raining. Oh. What are you going to do? Take my books back tomorrow. Are you going to take your books back to the library? Yeah. Gradually I realized that I\u2019m learning less here about disabilities than what people with disabilities seem to teach others of what it means to be human. Again, Jean Vanier, the founder of L\u2019Arche. I remember when a man who had gone through a very deep experience in one of our homes had been kept awake all night by one of the people who had screamed all night. He came to see me the next morning and he said, \u2018You know, I wept all morning. I was in the chapel. I thought I could have killed him.\u2019 And we talked about it, and I said to him, \u2018You know, I think this is probably one of the most important days of your life. You came to L\u2019Arche thinking you could do good to the poor, and you have. You\u2019ve done a lot of good. But today you are discovering that you are poor.\u2019 We all need help, and it\u2019s only as we discover that \u2018I have a handicap,\u2019 that \u2018I am broken,\u2019 that \u2018we\u2019re all broken,\u2019 and then we can begin to work at it. My name is Carolyn Luebe. A typical day\u2014I don\u2019t know if there is a typical day but I get up with the men in this house\u2014Victor and George, Dick, Dan, and Mike. We get up around 5:30 in the morning on Monday through Friday. Victor puts away the dishes in the morning, Dan takes out the trash, and Dick will help. He\u2019ll set the table and he\u2019ll help on the days that the garbage truck comes around. He\u2019ll get the trash out to the curb and the recycling buckets. Mike, he helps. He likes to mop the floors. So everybody has things that they like to do. And George, George likes to fold house laundry. So it\u2019s really\u2014we share life together and we really work well together. We enjoy all of that. We enjoy our time together. The rhythm of life here also includes a full workday for all the community\u2019s core members. Each weekday they board a city bus for Skyline Industries in Clinton, a sheltered workshop which subcontracts with various industries for special projects and tasks. I\u2019m Elizabeth Peltier and I work here in the workshop. Can you describe just what kinds of jobs people will be doing? Oh, there\u2019s material-handling, where they are the ones who supply the other clients with the materials that they need. Then there are other ones that are just strictly packers or heat-sealers. We have a few of them on different machinery around here, too, teaching them how to run nailers and stuff like that. Do people change jobs quite often, or\u2026 Oh, yes. Well, I run one of the more diverse lines. We do just about anything that comes our way. So, you know, we try to adjust the job according to what they like or what they need to learn. Do you enjoy this work? Is this\u2026 Oh, yeah. I think I\u2019ve found my life\u2019s work. I\u2019m, like, their advocate, you know? I\u2019m their friend, their supervisor, their confidante, you know. It\u2019s really rewarding, too, you know, because, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ve bonded, we\u2019ve become friends. It\u2019s a nice work environment. As we waited for the city bus at the end of the workday, there were dramatic farewells as every supervisor, manager, and truck driver drove out of the premises. The core members were joking and laughing and waving. And likewise, the people in the cars were leaning out the windows, laughing back, blowing kisses. I suspect that this passionate scene is repeated every day as a matter of routine. Even my colleague, Scott, an engineer who had arrived on the scene to record sound, was quickly welcomed and engaged. Hi. Hi. What your\u2014your name? I\u2019m Scott. Hi, Scott. What\u2019s your name? George. George, hi. George, hi. He is my honey. He is? Yes. My name\u2019s Bill. Hi, Bill. Hi. How are you? Good. When the bus arrived, the driver knew the names of every person who stepped aboard, and he addressed them like friends. Hi, Kenny. Hi. Hi, Bonnie. Hi, Mary. The seven full-time assistants who make their home at The Arch in Clinton range in age from 35 to 59. At the time of our visit, there was one person who\u2019s been there for a year, and two going on 10 years. They take evident joy in this community and also speak openly of the complex dynamics which life at L\u2019Arche inspires in them. You go through this honeymoon period where you think that, \u2018Gee, this is just really wonderful, what we\u2019re living.\u2019 And then you realize that there are times that are not so wonderful. I think in getting to know the men that I live with and the other core members in this community and the other assistants, I see myself reflected back in them. I see good things about myself; I see those things that I don\u2019t like about myself. I think that\u2019s the thing that I see a lot here is just the vulnerability of people and the struggle that they have in just wanting to belong and to have a purpose and to have a place in this world, to be accepted. : Oh, my name is Chris Bruin. And, actually, I started in 1985 just coming to do relief work, coming on weekends so people could have days away. And then I moved in in 1986. So I\u2019ve been here since November of \u201986. I think maybe that\u2019s something that has changed over the years, and I think just lately with me, thinking that, you know, being success was the things you had and what you acquired. But now it\u2019s not so much that. It\u2019s more, for me, it\u2019s just maybe how I am with others. I think it\u2019s how I start to see my success more now and being comfortable with, you know, without having a lot. And all, that\u2019s where I see my success now. I guess. You kind of lose your own identity in some ways. You know, it\u2019s not like a religious community if you would join a convent or something and, you know, you\u2019d give up the idea of getting married, or you give up all your personal belongings. L\u2019Arche is not like that. Maybe, you know, what you lose is your sense of being able to hide yourself. It\u2019s really a struggle for me. It\u2019s more of a struggle than I would have been able to acknowledge when I came here, for sure. Eric Plaut has been at The Arch for 10 years. He became interested in working with the handicapped as he left college in Wisconsin. Seeking adventure, he was intrigued when he heard of a new L\u2019Arche community forming in Labrador, Nova Scotia. To prepare, he was asked to do an internship in Clinton. In the end, the Labrador community didn\u2019t get off the ground, and to his own surprise, he began a new life not far from his Wisconsin home, in Iowa. Eric Plaut speaks frankly of the complexities of life at L\u2019Arche as an assistant. He told me about one experience he had at a university conference several years ago to which the whole community was invited. Probably something like this has happened to most assistants, but when we got there a woman that was receiving us clearly mistook me for a core member and was treating me in that kind of, you know, patronizing way, or like\u2014and then someone had to point out to her, \u2018No, he\u2019s an assistant.\u2019 And I think she got embarrassed and kind of ran away. But my reaction to that was that I was really offended. And when I reflect on that now, that is showing me that really I probably still have a long ways to go. Core members\u2014I don\u2019t think of them as saints, certainly, because there is that tendency to do that, you know, to really look at all of this stuff in a kind of a saccharine way. But sometimes, yes, the things that they do that I consider prophetic, you know, rather than saintly, but prophetic, and sometimes those are very positive models. You know, I told a story of Roberta and Mary Pat when they were at the Olympics, and how they did their race holding hands, you know, the whole time. And I thought, you know, that, to me, is an example of being able to celebrate sports in a way that the culture could learn from that, you know? But sometimes the prophetic example is not so positive. So, for instance, one of the core members that\u2019s struggling, you know, with a relationship with someone who\u2019s romantically interested in him but he doesn\u2019t return that feeling, but he\u2019s afraid to tell her that. When I see things like that going on, what\u2019s going on with the core members is they don\u2019t mask those things, you know, as well as many people would be able to do. So that becomes a mirror for me. And those kind of revelations are painful, you know, at times. And so it\u2019s not all good, maybe. But just the intention is good, and the whole idea of it is really important and valuable in recognizing the giftedness of our people, and also the importance of accepting and being reconciled to weakness and what that means. What I\u2019ve seen, or what I\u2019ve experienced in L\u2019Arche has been many times the beauty of things that go wrong even, or that don\u2019t go according to the way we would like them to or according to our plan, but they\u2019re still wonderful. And that\u2019s the charism of L\u2019Arche. While in Clinton visiting The Arch, I rediscover the writings of the celebrated author Henri Nouwen. Nouwen was, perhaps, the most famous L\u2019Arche resident, and his books have drawn many pilgrims to short stays at these homes across the world. At the age of 64 in 1986, after teaching at Notre Dame, Yale, and Harvard and writing a number of best-selling books, Henri Nouwen found himself burnt out. He went to spend what would become the last decade of his life at the L\u2019Arche community in Toronto, which is called Daybreak. One of the books he wrote from Daybreak was about what he learned from a single member of that community, a severely handicapped 25-year-old man named Adam who could not speak, dress himself, walk, or eat without help. Here is an excerpt from that account. \u201CRecently, I moved from Harvard to a place near Toronto called Daybreak. That is, from an institution for the best and brightest to a community where mentally handicapped people and their assistants try to live together in the spirit of the Beatitudes. In my house, 10 of us form a family. Gradually, I\u2019m forgetting who is handicapped and who is not. We are simply John, Bill, Trevor, Raymond, Rose, Steve, Jane, Naomi, Henri, and Adam. \u201CI want to tell you Adam\u2019s story. After a month of working with Adam, something started to happen to me that had never happened before. This severely handicapped young man, whom outsiders sometimes describe with very hurtful words, started to become my dearest companion. As I carried him into his bath and made waves to let the water run fast around him and told him all sorts of stories, I knew that two friends were communicating far beyond the realm of thought. \u201CBefore this, I had come to believe that what makes us human is our mind. But Adam keeps showing me that what makes us human is our heart, the center of our being where God has hidden trust, hope, and love. Whoever sees in Adam merely a burden to society misses the sacred mystery that Adam is fully capable of receiving and giving love. He is fully human\u2014not half human, not nearly human, but fully, completely human because he is all heart. The longer I stay with Adam, the more clearly I see him as a gentle teacher, teaching me what no book or professor ever could. \u201COnce, when Adam\u2019s parents came for a visit I asked, \u2018Tell me, during all the years you had Adam in your house, what did he give you?\u2019 His father smiled and said without hesitation, \u2018He brought us peace.\u2019 I know he is right. After months of being with Adam, I am discovering within myself an inner quiet that I did not know before. Adam is one of the most broken persons among us, but without doubt our strongest bond. Because of Adam there is always someone home. Because of Adam there is a quiet rhythm in the house. Because of Adam there are moments of silence. Because of Adam there are always words of affection and tenderness. Because of Adam there is patience and endurance. Because of Adam there are smiles and tears visible to all. Because of Adam there is always time and space for forgiveness and healing. Yes, because of Adam there is peace among us.\u201D A reading from Henri Nouwen\u2019s book Adam: God\u2019s Beloved. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, with a radio pilgrimage to \u201CL\u2019Arche: A Community of Brokenness and Beauty.\u201D I find The Arch in Clinton to be much as Henri Nouwen described in his writings about L\u2019Arche, a place of astonishing serenity and an almost raucous joy. Oh, yeah! We\u2019ll have a slumber party! Yeah! All right! Yeah! In my days here, I couldn\u2019t help but draw connections between the lessons of this place and some of the larger issues in our world, including medical technology. More and more we are able to ensure that babies will not be born with mental retardation. L\u2019Arche didn\u2019t leave me with easy answers, but it placed the questions in a new light. Before I left Clinton, I sat down with Jo Anne Horstmann one last time. It\u2019s hard for me, you know, because I\u2019ve chosen to live and be with people who are handicapped. Parents didn\u2019t choose it, it chose them. And I can sit here easily and talk about the gift of people with a handicap, you know, but I haven\u2019t experienced giving birth and living all the challenges of getting people to the point where we welcome people at the age of 18, you know, all the challenges that go into raising a child with a disability. I mean, do you ever ask yourself the question that would be the question most people would ask on the surface: \u2018How, if there\u2019s a God, why are children born like this with these terrible problems?\u2019 You know, this woman that I talked to a couple of days ago said, \u2018You know, I always thought when I get to heaven my first question\u2019s going to be is, \u201CWhy did you give me a handicapped child,\u201D you know?\u2019 And there was so much anger in her voice. You know, you could hear it. She wants to know why did God give her this handicapped child? And because of L\u2019Arche I think she\u2019s, you know, she\u2019s really able to see that her daughter, rather than being a burden, has become a gift. But it\u2019s been a painful journey to get to that point. When I first arrived the other night, you talked about the core residents\u2019 gift of gentleness, and I was aware of that right away. And it almost made me feel afraid at first. I had this question in my mind whether the world can bear such gentleness, or whether this gentleness can survive in this world we live in. And then, as I\u2019m here for a couple of days and I hear your stories, it feels almost like the gentleness that is sort of hidden, you know, comes out of hiding here in the midst of you. Core members just call us to that, you know, to be gentle with them because they are first gentle to us, you know? And it\u2019s what Jean Vanier saw, you know, 35 years ago when he went into institutions, you know, that here\u2019s a great gift that our society could benefit from, and these folks are being held away from the society. So now they\u2019re in the society and you see how the bus drivers react, and how we react, and how you react, you know? That you have a new sense of what gentleness is all about because of your experience being with people who are handicapped. Talk to me about what it means to you, and how you think about the fact that although you are this rather small community in this small town in Iowa, you\u2019re also a part of a much larger movement that is in many countries. It really helps us to know that there\u2019s other people living similar lives. I mean, I just don\u2019t think we could do this if we were just The Arch. It\u2019s a challenging lifestyle, it\u2019s a lifestyle that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just founded and you live and breathe commitment. And we\u2019re on this journey together with lots of other people to help us on the way. Here\u2019s something else that I want to name. When you speak, you talk a lot about Jesus, and Jean Vanier does, too. So, on the one hand there is this boldness about Jesus, and at the same time L\u2019Arche itself has become more ecumenical, and in some places\u2014I know the communities in India are interfaith. That you have Muslim and Hindu and Christian residents and assistants. Right. I mean, it\u2019s true that when you hear Jean Vanier talk it\u2019s all about Jesus and who Jesus is and how Jesus is revealed to us and how we reveal Jesus to other people. And yet, this international organization that he started is now interfaith. So, you know, it just sometimes goes beyond even our own beliefs into the unifying thing that we all have that need for, again is to love and to be accepted and to be cared for and to be forgiven. And, you know, Jesus in the Gospels was always with the poor. And, you know, Jean Vanier himself, to me, incarnates Jesus more and better than anyone I\u2019ve ever experienced besides, of course, Dick and Gary and Birdie. Jo Ann Horstmann is regional coordinator for the L\u2019Arche Federation in the central United States. Here again, L\u2019Arche founder, Jean Vanier. In L\u2019Arche we live this sort of double mystery. There\u2019s the whole presence of Mary in Bethlehem and Nazareth, and Mary\u2019s standing at the foot of the cross. I mean, that has a lot of meaning for us, to stand and to be present and just to say, \u2018I\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with you.\u2019 In my own foyer there\u2019s a man called Patrick who, technically speaking, he has a psychosis. And there\u2019s a lot of pain and a lot of anguish and, in particular, at some moments. But when I reflect about Patrick, he has everything he needs. He has good medication, good doctors. He has work, he works in the workshop. He has food, he has home. But what does he need over and above that? He needs a friend. What is essential is somebody who believes in him, who trusts him, who sees in him a presence of God. L\u2019Arche Founder Jean Vanier. When I set out for Clinton, I was fascinated by how L\u2019Arche communities attempt to live a great religious paradox: the notion that the strength of God often reveals itself in weakness and humility, in what is outcast and discarded. L\u2019Arche residents also live the notion of diversity in a way which challenges our culture\u2019s commitment to that virtue. This isn\u2019t diversity born of beautiful and intriguing differences, at least not on the surface. The beauty of life at L\u2019Arche appears through brokenness. To say that the people at The Arch in Clinton, Iowa, are happy is too simple. Here is the truth I experienced: Spending ordinary time at The Arch is like spending time with family at its best. I\u2019ve rarely been in a place where there is so much laughter and where the rhythm of life includes a real joy in that deceptive phrase, \u201Cthe simple things of life.\u201D I\u2019ve rarely been hugged so fervently by strangers and enjoyed it. And at the same time, running through my stay in Clinton was an underlying sense of grief which broke in on us again and again. I could see the struggle and loneliness left on people by the hardness of life, especially before they came to live in this place. And between us there were many moments of awkwardness, gaps in which we all were helpless as I failed to understand the words they tried to speak. The core members of The Arch don\u2019t hide their pain in these moments, but they live with it gracefully, forgiving me for not getting it, forgiving themselves for not managing it, forgiving God for this design flaw. And what relationship, what family, what workplace, doesn\u2019t require such a habit of forgiveness? It\u2019s this generosity of spirit towards one\u2019s self and others which makes community here possible on a new level. It\u2019s something that the core members teach every guest like me. And so I return to this theological mystery of beauty in brokenness, of strength in weakness, which is also a puzzle at the heart of what it means to be human, a puzzle which none of our education or technological advances will solve for us. The contemplative priest Thomas Merton put it this way: \u201CI cannot discover God in myself and myself in others unless I have the courage to face myself exactly as I am, with all my limitations, and to accept others as they are, with all their limitations. The religious answer is not religion if it is not fully real.\u201D Fittingly, as I left The Arch, the members of that community saw me off with a blessing, rather than the other way around.
