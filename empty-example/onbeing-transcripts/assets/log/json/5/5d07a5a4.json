  "fullText": "You go to the doctor for anything, and they won\u2019t begin to treat you without taking your history \u2014 and not just yours, but that of your parents and grandparents before you. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson points this out as she reflects on her epic book, The Warmth of Other Suns. It\u2019s a carrier of histories, stories, truths that help make sense of human and social challenges newly visible at the heart of our life together. Isabel Wilkerson has also become an unexpected voice on the enduring human drama of refugees and immigration. She is herself a product of one of the most under-reported stories of the 20th century which she chronicles \u2014 the exodus or Great Migration of 6 million African Americans from the south to the north of the United States. Our country is like a really old house. I love old houses. I\u2019ve always lived in old houses. But old houses need a lot of work. And the work is never done. And just when you think you\u2019ve finished one renovation, it\u2019s time to do something else. Something else has gone wrong. And that\u2019s what our country is like. And you may not want to go into that basement, but if you really don\u2019t go into that basement, it\u2019s at your own peril. And I think that whatever you are ignoring is not going to go away. Whatever you\u2019re ignoring is only going to get worse. Whatever you\u2019re ignoring will be there to be reckoned with until you reckon with it. And I think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re called upon to do where we are right now. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Isabel Wilkerson won the Pulitzer Prize for her work as Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times and is the recipient of the National Humanities Medal. The Great Migration gave the world a bounty of brilliance \u2014 from Michelle Obama and James Baldwin, to Diana Ross and John Coltrane \u2014 while also planting harder foundations that continue to touch on every American in some way. The Warmth of Other Suns traces this story through the lens of three ordinary lives in three succeeding generations: Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, who moved from Mississippi to Chicago in the 1930s; George Swanson Starling from Florida to New York in the 1940s; and Robert Joseph Pershing Foster, who went from Louisiana to California in the 1950s. I interviewed Isabel Wilkerson at the Faith in Literature Festival at the University of North Carolina Asheville. You, yourself, are a child of this Great Migration. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about that. And also, I always ask this question about the religious or spiritual background of someone\u2019s childhood. And I think that as my cumulative conversation has progressed, I have a much more expansive imagination about what that is, the spiritual background of one\u2019s childhood. So I just wonder if the fact that you\u2019re a child of this migration flowed into what you now might imagine as the spiritual background of your childhood. I do think that they\u2019re intertwined. I mean, I\u2019m a daughter of two people who uprooted themselves from the old country of the South, from different states, and relocated and remade themselves in the new world, which was Washington D.C. for them. And in doing so, that meant that they were kind of leaving behind parts of themselves in order to take on this new persona. I think that\u2019s what migrants often do is they take on the identity of the new place that they hope will work out for them, no guarantees, a leap of faith into the unknown. When it comes to the family background, it so happens that my mother\u2019s father was a baptist minister, and my father grew up in Virginia also in a baptist church. It also happens that my father was a pilot. He actually taught Tuskegee airmen. He was an airman, and he also taught \u2014 did flight training for them. And I think there\u2019s something about being the daughter of a pilot that makes you feel that metaphorically you could fly too. I like that. So the title of the book is The Warmth of Other Suns, which comes from some lines of Richard Wright, another product of this experience, as he was about to leave Mississippi for Chicago in 1927. And I\u2019m just going to read it. OK. He wrote, \u201CI was leaving the South to fling myself into the unknown\u2026 I was taking a part of the South to transplant in alien soil, to see if it could grow differently, if it could drink of new and cool rains, bend in strange winds, respond to the warmth of other suns and, perhaps \u2014 just perhaps \u2014 to bloom.\u201D You\u2019ve said that the language of \u201Cpolitical asylum\u201D is absolutely apt here for what people were undertaking. And it\u2019s just not \u2014 as much as we know a lot of these stories and a lot of the things that were wrong, that feels like a new recognition. It does. I think that because it happened within the borders of our own country, we don\u2019t think about it as \u2014 first of all, it was a kind of immigration. Although, these were \u2014 this was the only group of Americans who had to act like immigrants in order to be recognized as citizens. They were forced to seek political asylum within the borders of their own country because they were living in a caste system in the South that did not recognize their citizenship. And some of them travelled farther than current day immigrants might, but that was really not the point. The point was that the country actually was kind of two countries in one, and that\u2019s what they had to do. I often say that the book is viewed as being a book about the Great Migration, and over time, as I\u2019ve talked about it over these years, I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s not about migration. The Great Migration is not about migration, and really, probably no migration is about migration. It\u2019s about freedom and how far people are willing to go to achieve it. This is the means that they feel they must take in order to find freedom wherever they can find it. Yeah. And this book is such a \u2014 it embodies this paradox that writers know, that storytellers know, that radio actually knows, that the more particular you can get with your story, the more universally it can be received, that others can join their life and their imagination with what you have to share. And there were these moments for me in the book that were just so human, that were so relatable, that made all these other horrors come home. And so one of them for me was George Swanson Starling. You asked him what he hoped for in leaving, and he said, \u201CI was hoping I would be able to live as a man and express myself in a manly way\u201D \u2014 I\u2019m getting chills \u2014 \u201Cwithout the fear of getting lynched at night.\u201D And even the way it comes across \u2014 he didn\u2019t say it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t sound like he said it with a lot of bitterness or drama. It was just matter of fact. Not even that much emotion because it was \u2014 these were the facts of their lives. And at that time when they were growing up \u2014 and this time period was a very long time. I mean, it was the end of Reconstruction until the 1970s. It encompassed someone who was born in the 1880s and passed away in the \u201860s would\u2019ve known nothing other than this. And so, these were the facts of their lives. And he didn\u2019t \u2014 he was not emotional. He wasn\u2019t bitter. It was just a matter-of-fact statement of what it was that he was up against and why he felt he had no choice but to go. I ran into a lot of people who said they don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve lived if they had stayed. There was actually a tremendous amount of fear that a lot parents in the South had for their children if they were extroverted and opinionated. If their children were? Yeah, if they were spirited and expressive, there was a need to reign that in. I mean, in other words, childhood itself had to be controlled and repressed because it could mean their very lives. And so he grew up under that. And his father said, \u201CIf you\u2019re going to continue doing this work, the things you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s best that you go.\u201D And one of the things that happened in this Great Migration is that it spread people all over this country. I mean, people \u2014 these places that they went, there had not been a significant African American population. So you look at the African American population of all of the cities in the North, Midwest, and West are a result of this. We\u2019re seeing the manifestation of that, Seattle or Oakland or Los Angeles. Detroit wasn\u2019t Detroit. No, it wasn\u2019t. None of these places were what they were at the time. And a lot of them are filled by people who felt they had no choice and that they would not have lived if they hadn\u2019t gotten out. And it\u2019s not like they were being welcomed with open arms when they landed in northern cities. No. Many of them, sadly \u2014 I mean, the great tragedy is that they were brought in as strikebreakers by the companies who were trying to break the unions. And so that meant that \u2014 one of the great tragedies of the 20th century is that there were all of these people arriving in these big cities in the North, industrial cities, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo, all of these places, and there were people coming in from parts of Europe, Eastern and Southern Europe, for example, and there were people coming from the South, African Americans \u2014 all wanting the same thing. And there were places \u2013 in Milwaukee, for example \u2013 that said no African Americans \u2014 many places actually said African Americans would not be hired. But they would stop them as they were walking up to the factory gate because it was visible that they were African-American. And so, as it turned out, many of the recruiters representing, you might say, the North \u2014 they wanted the labor of African Americans from the South but didn\u2019t want the people. How do you do that? Right, right. So, I want to read a little bit of another moment for me \u2014 and this brings us to our moment \u2014 another moment in the book that was just heartbreaking. It was very early on. And it\u2019s when you first met Ida Mae in 1996 in Chicago. \u201CFrom the open door in the vestibule, I see her. She is sitting in a cotton housedress on a baby blue, plastic-covered easy chair by the window. She is looking through a parting of the curtains at the street circus below. There they are, all scuffling beneath her: urban drug dealers, falling-down sweatpants pooling at their feet, now bent over the driver\u2019s-side window of a late-model sedan from the suburbs; fourth-graders doing lookout for men who could be their fathers; young girls with their stomachs swelling already; middle-aged men living out of their Pontiacs; gangsters who might not make it to the weekend. She lives on the second floor of a three-flat on the South Side of Chicago.\u201D And I want to say before I say this \u2014 she is a remarkable, joyful person, but this is a heartbreaking moment\u2026 It is. \u2026to know that this is\u2026 What it had come to. This is what it became for her in Chicago, the promised land. It\u2019s a reflection of the structures that they confronted upon arrival. It\u2019s all the things that \u2014 sociology and political science and the history come together and show us that they arrived invited but not welcome. They arrived making the least for the hardest work. They arrived consigned to neighborhoods in which \u2014 that were declining, but had been declining from the moment they arrived. I mean, I\u2019m talking about the beginning of the Migration, that the subdivisions, the subdivided cold water flats that they were living in, the originating part of where these people were living upon arrival. And they were not \u2014 African Americans were not permitted in any of theses cities to live anywhere that they wanted or anywhere that their money would take them. All of us who have been to any city in the North know exactly where the arriving district or arriving neighborhood of people of the Great Migration would be because that\u2019s where \u2014 it\u2019s the oldest, broken-down neighborhood in all of these cities, usually not well-positioned, by the railroad tracks or near the factories. It\u2019s almost like the refugee camps of now. Because you go to refugee camps around the world now, and you hear the word \u201Crefugee camp,\u201D and you think it\u2019s tents. But in fact, where you have refugee camps where generations of people have been living, it looks like\u2026 That\u2019s exactly it. I mean, that\u2019s such an incredible observation that you\u2019re making. These were refugee camps created in our American cities. And as they sought to expand, or if they managed to save whatever they could from these jobs \u2014 and a lot of them, new research about the Great Migration is coming out showing that they actually worked multiple jobs. So they were actually making more money, but it wasn\u2019t going as far because there were so many coming in, flooding these neighborhoods that were being hemmed in and pressed against. And that was the world that they had entered. They were living in the Vice Districts. I mean, all of the things that make for every possible disadvantage that you can have going in \u2014 that\u2019s what they were facing. Your existence, by definition, prohibited you from getting a standard mortgage. And so they would then get mortgages on the second market \u2014 secondary market which meant they were paying exorbitant rates. This is sounding very much like 2006 and 2007 for us now. And so this is all setting in motion all of these forces that were making it even more difficult for people to succeed in these big places, the cities of refuge for the people of the Great Migration. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with journalist Isabel Wilkerson, the author of The Warmth of Other Suns. So, between the time you first published the book in 2010 and today, these have been years in which we have been forced to confront the fact that, with all the laws that were passed and with the progress that was made, there\u2019s so much unfinished business, and in fact, that all the progress wasn\u2019t there. And I wonder how you watch what has risen to the surface. I mean, I think that the good news is that we see this. It\u2019s not unseeable anymore. It\u2019s a moment of reckoning. And I wonder how, having traced this history, being able to see the origins of some of these dynamics that we\u2019re facing now, how you have understood what is happening now in ways that perhaps you wouldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t done this research and delved into this story. Well, it\u2019s kind of reminded me that our country is like a really old house. I love old houses. I\u2019ve always lived in old houses. But old houses need a lot of work. And the work is never done. And just when you think you\u2019ve finished one renovation, it\u2019s time to do something else. Something else has gone wrong. And that\u2019s what our country is like. And you may not want to go into that basement, but if you really don\u2019t go into that basement, it\u2019s at your own peril. And I think that whatever you are ignoring is not going to go away. Whatever you\u2019re ignoring is only going to get worse. Whatever you\u2019re ignoring will be there to be reckoned with until you reckon with it. And I think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re called upon to do where we are right now. I\u2019m also reminded there\u2019s a tremendous amount of new and exciting research on the \u2014 sort of the \u2014 that this is foundational, sort of in the DNA of our country, which is what this book is about too. It\u2019s about the caste system, the artificial hierarchy that was put in place before our great-great-great grandparents were alive. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve inherited. It\u2019s not something that we wanted. If you\u2019re on the beneficiary end of it, you didn\u2019t ask to be on the beneficiary end of it. Certainly, if you\u2019re on the targeted end of it, you certainly didn\u2019t ask to be on that. But this is where we are. And I think that it\u2019s calling upon us to reckon with this finally. The disturbing thing about where we happen to be right now is that, yes, these things are unseeable, but that does not mean that action\u2019s being taken. I mean, we see that so many of these cases are really not being prosecuted. And each case that does not get acted upon, I think, deepens our own collective complicity in this injustice. I also think that we have to recognize how we are all being victimized, too, by these images of death. We\u2019re actually seeing human beings, American citizens, unarmed citizens, who are dying before our very eyes. And what is the effect that that is having on all of us collectively? Is that inuring us? Is that numbing us to the \u2014 to black death? Is it making it acceptable on some level? Because you see something enough times, it normalizes it. And I would like to think that this would never be viewed as normal. Yeah, I mean, here\u2019s a striking, terrible statistic that you note, that there was a lynching every four days in the early decades of the 20th century, and it\u2019s been estimated that an African American is now killed by police every two to three days. I also find great hope in the science of implicit bias. It\u2019s also just us understanding our brains. Yes. And if you want to see it in the largest possible perspective, it\u2019s this possibility we have in the 21st century of wholeness, of really understanding ourselves in our wholeness. I\u2019ve never thought of it in terms of people getting inured to black death, but I do think something that happens is that these images \u2014 people feel so paralyzed by them. Right? So, it\u2019s so terrible, it\u2019s so inexplicable, and you have no idea how you could make a difference. I would agree with you. I actually find this new research \u2014 which is why I described it as exciting. I think that what\u2019s freeing about it \u2014 it\u2019s liberating because it takes it away from the personal. This is not personal. It doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t things that each and every one of us can do in our personal lives in how we comport ourselves, and how we reach out to others, and how we treat those around us, and other actions that we might choose to take politically or otherwise. But it also means that \u2014 it frees us from the twin barriers to understanding, guilt and shame. Because it\u2019s not personal. And a caste system is a structure that we have inherited, that we did not create, that we don\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s no point in pointing fingers about it, but it\u2019s something that we \u2014 recognizing it is the first step toward dismantling it. And as much as \u2014 the dynamics here and abroad \u2014 there\u2019s a lot that is a fearful backlash, a kind of fearful and frightening resistance to this knowledge, that also comes from those primitive parts of our brain. Absolutely. But I feel like the success of this book and books like Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow and Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2026 She uses the term \u201Ccaste\u201D too. It came out the same year. We didn\u2019t \u2014 neither of us knew about the term. It was the term to use. Our independent research, separate, came to the conclusion that that was the appropriate and precise term to describe the way that we live, the world in which we live. And the way people are engaging with this telling of a truth, and her work, and Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s book, I want to take that seriously because it does suggest an opening to knowing this and to grappling with this. I mean, you\u2019ve said to me \u2014 really all you do \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, but all you do now is travel around accepting invitations to talk about this in rooms like this, which makes me feel really hopeful. I mean, it\u2019s kind of a narrative of another kind of energy that\u2019s present in this moment that we don\u2019t tell ourselves that story of right now. But I don\u2019t know. Am I reading that into it? What has been your experience of being out there with this material? Well, it\u2019s actually been all over the world. And I actually was in Singapore talking about this book, and I was speaking to a group of high school students, who can be sometimes challenging. And I usually like to give them examples of people who they can recognize who were part of the Great Migration, but I didn\u2019t know how well that would play there. And so I was giving these clues, and I said, \u201CWell, this is an individual who was a guitarist, and his mother was from Virginia, and she migrated out to Seattle.\u201D And the hand shot up in the back. This student just shot up, \u201CJimi Hendrix.\u201D And I was just thinking, my goodness, it is just \u2014 it is really truly migrated \u2014 I mean, the culture has migrated and the appreciation for how this has unfolded and the impact that it\u2019s had has resonance around the world beyond that. And Michelle Obama is also another good \u2014 this person in the center of our culture right now, who is just a great story of \u2014 a product of this\u2026 Absolutely. Product \u2014 I mean, there are so many people \u2014 Toni Morrison, August Wilson\u2026 Denzel Washington. \u2026Lorraine Hansbury, Denzel Washington. I mean, there are so, so many people that you could \u2014 that\u2019s one way of recognizing the impact that it had. Because, ultimately, what this migration was \u2014 and I think people are identifying it \u2014 is that it\u2019s an unleashing of this pent-up creativity and genius, in many cases, of people miscast in this caste system. You think about those cotton fields, and those rice plantations, and those tobacco fields, and on all of those cotton fields, and tobacco plantations, and rice plantations were opera singers, and jazz musicians, and poets, and professors, defense attorneys, doctors \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 this is the manifestation of the desire to be free and what was lost to the country. Because for centuries, for 246 years of enslavement \u2014 and I have to remind people \u2014 12 generations of enslavement, 12 generations of enslavement. How many \u201Cgreats\u201D do you add to \u201Cgrandparent\u201D to get that back to 1619 until 1863? And that gives you a sense of how long all of these people were miscast into an artificial hierarchy as to what they were permitted to do, or risk death if they did not do that. And one fact about this whole idea of where we are right now just sort of cosmically, I think, in terms of this \u2014 let me put it this way: no adult alive today will live to see a time when the time of enslavement was equal to the time of freedom. And so that shows you that this history is long, and the history is deep. When you go to other countries, you go in other parts of the world, in Europe or India or other places, and the history goes so far back. And the people in Portugal can still remember, \u201CWell, there was that catastrophe in the 15th century. We still haven\u2019t gotten over that yet.\u201D Think about how this is really not that long ago in a sense of generations, in the sense of even sort of \u2014 I would view it almost cellular memory in the bones of a people. I actually was also encouraged by the fact that after the Charleston Mother Emanuel shootings, the Commonwealth of Virginia rose to the occasion and the Richmond Times-Dispatch \u2014 the editorial board said that there should be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and that it should come from Virginia, which was the capital of the Confederacy. And the solutions lie in the South, I believe. I really believe that the solutions lie in the South. You can listen again and share this conversation with Isabel Wilkerson through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson in a public event at the University of North Carolina Asheville. She wrote the epic work of narrative nonfiction, The Warmth of Other Suns, about The Great Migration of nearly 6 million African Americans from the south to the north of the United States in the 20th Century. We\u2019re exploring the light her revelations shed on the promise and challenges of now. I wanted to read something that \u2014 this was a blog, a minister in rural New England. Do you know this? I don\u2019t. It\u2019s called \u201CFaith in the Ordinary.\u201D \u201CIn New Hampshire, the third whitest state in the U.S. with a white population of 96 percent (and a state that borders numbers one and two \u2014 Maine at 96.9 percent, Vermont at 96.7 percent), we have to work harder to make these connections. If you haven\u2019t read it, try and find a book called The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson. It is, hands down, the best work of nonfiction I have ever read. It tells the story of how the Jim Crow laws and their accompanying attitudes shaped the lives of three black Americans who came north during the 20th century. When I was reading it, I kept saying over and over again\u201D \u2014 just like \u2014 \u201C\u2018I had no idea. I had no idea.\u2019\u201D And then, \u201CWe may be clueless and awkward around the subject of race, but we know what the Gospel demands. That we keep working at being better neighbors.\u201D I think about that so much these days, about this work of knowing our neighbors who are strangers, and that that, in fact, is the immediate work that, in fact, is not evident how we do it because we\u2019re so segregated in so many ways in our communities, but it\u2019s possible. People must ask you this question. I wonder how \u2014 if there\u2019s advice you give or thoughts you \u2014 that\u2019s terrible \u2014 or thoughts you have about this work of coming to know our neighbors who are strangers, of being neighbors, just that. Well, I think I want to start to answer the question with a fundamental, sad recognition with these police shootings and then get to the answer. And that is that there\u2019s so many things disturbing about them, and the videos are showing them. But I think that people can disagree on what the officer was thinking, the circumstances of his arrival, what he saw, what he thought. And these are split-second decisions. There are a lot of things going on. And often, they \u2014 there\u2019s a refrain that comes across. It says \u201CI feared for my life. I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know. I feared for my life.\u201D But I think the human question that is disturbing and hard to reckon with is what is happening in these cases after the person is down? And I think that all of us have to think about what is it that we\u2019re hearing, and what is it that we\u2019re seeing? Why is it that basic human response to a person in distress \u2014 why is it that first aid cannot be administered to people once they are bleeding on the ground? Where is the threat once they are already near death? Why can\u2019t they \u2014 even if they\u2019re not equipped \u2014 and I would assume that an officer of the peace would be equipped, but I\u2019m not expert in this \u2014 but even the basic human response to take the hand of someone whose life is slipping away from them and to comfort them. That is the essential missing piece, which is empathy. Empathy and recognition in the common humanity of another person. And as I said, we can disagree on the circumstances and the details and the so-called facts of the situation, but after the person is down, where is the humanity? And I think it calls upon all of us to recognize, I think, the need for radical empathy. Empathy is not pity or sympathy in which you are \u2014 pity, you\u2019re looking down on someone and feeling sorry for them. Sympathy, you may be looking across at someone and feeling bad for them. Empathy means getting inside of them, and understanding their reality, and looking at their situation and saying not, \u201CWhat would I do if I were in their position?\u201D but, \u201CWhat are they doing? Why are they doing what they\u2019re doing from the perspective of what they have endured?\u201D And that is an additional step. There are multiple steps that a person has to take to really be open to that. Thank you. In all of these discussions about what\u2019s going on now, we\u2019re so very divided, and there\u2019s such a focus on \u201Cother.\u201D And \u201Cother\u201D can mean all kinds of things. And so people will often say, \u201CWhy is it that those people do that thing?\u201D The only answer to that question is, \u201CWhy do human beings do what they do when they\u2019re in that situation?\u201D And it calls for radical empathy in order to put ourselves inside the experiences of another and to allow ourselves the pain, allow ourselves the heartbreak, allow ourselves the sense of hopelessness, whatever it may be that they\u2019re experiencing. And it\u2019s a difficult thing to do, but it\u2019s necessary, I think. I think one of the reasons that we\u2019re in the situation we\u2019re in in our country is because the laws have been changed. Lots of laws were passed, actually, in the 1860s, and then they had to be revisited in the 1960s. And why is that? Partly, I think it\u2019s an indication that the laws are necessary, but they\u2019re not sufficient, and that we recognize that the laws can be changed if the hearts have not changed. And so I view myself as on kind of a mission to change the country, the world, one heart at a time. And it\u2019s a tough thing to do. I feel as if the heart is the last frontier because we have tried so many other things. And the laws that we\u2019ve passed that we thought were written in granite we see can be erased and are in peril if, as a collective, we do not recognize why. I also believe that, in the time of working on this book \u2014 it\u2019s multi-disciplinary. There\u2019s sociology, there\u2019s psychology, there\u2019s economics. All of these things are in there. But I think the foundation of all of those disciplines comes down to the history. When you go to the doctor, before you can even see the doctor, the very first thing they do is they give you all of these pages to fill out. And they \u2014 before the doctor will even see you, he wants to know your history. He doesn\u2019t want to know just your history, he wants to know your mother\u2019s history. He wants to know your father\u2019s history. They may go back to your grandmother and your grandfather on both sides. And that\u2019s before he will even see you. You cannot diagnose a problem until you know the history of the problem that you\u2019re trying to resolve. I think \u2014 you were asking about this book and how it\u2019s moved around in the world. I think this book is proof \u2014 or the response to it is proof that it\u2019s not as hard as it has to \u2014 as you might fear it will be, that actually you can find it, not just enlightening, but healing. But I think part of the reason you made it not as hard \u2014 you opened up the fact that it\u2019s not as hard as it has to be \u2014 is that you humanize the history. And I think that this minister is onto something when they say we need to see our neighbors. And I think \u201Cchanging your heart\u201D is a synonym for overcoming unconscious bias. There are these things that \u2014 it\u2019s becoming more conscious about what\u2019s going on inside us and then working with that. Another thing we\u2019re learning is that empathy is \u2014 and this is a problem with journalism, frankly \u2014 empathy is not triggered by a statistic. No. It\u2019s triggered \u2014 it\u2019s not triggered \u2014 and we should talk about this before we finish \u2014 by now millions of people moving across Europe in search of survival and freedom and just the ability to create a life for their children. We cannot take that in, but we can take in, every once in a while, the face of one child. And that enables us to take in the enormity of the tragedy. I mean, I feel like everything you just said also explains how \u2014 and this is something where I feel like if we could frame it this way, we could reckon with this better \u2014 how this is not \u2014 this moment we\u2019re in is not just a social crisis and not just a political crisis. It\u2019s a spiritual crisis. It\u2019s a spiritual crisis. And as much as we have to deal with it at those other levels, we have to deal with it at this level in terms of who we are. Because, really, that\u2019s all that\u2019s left. I mean, we have dealt \u2014 the economy gets dealt with. The laws get dealt with. I mean, these are things that are \u2014 they\u2019re front and center. And I think that, as a species, we know how to do that. It\u2019s the spiritual aspect. The human condition remains. It\u2019s looking into the human heart and examining it and allowing ourselves to feel the pain of others. You don\u2019t want to feel your own pain. Why would you want to feel someone else\u2019s pain? So I think it\u2019s an act of love and an act of faith to allow yourself to feel the pain of another. I think that\u2019s also why we have to accompany each other because it\u2019s not something that any of us welcomes, to feel that pain. But we do know that, if we take something like that on together, it can become bearable. That\u2019s why I feel like it\u2019s so important to have a group of us in this room together, thinking about these things together. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with journalist Isabel Wilkerson, the author of The Warmth of Other Suns. Gosh, there\u2019s so much else we could talk about. I do want to say that, as I was reading this book \u2014 and again, this is not something you could\u2019ve imagined in 2010 \u2014 I was thinking about the refugee crisis in our midst now. And it\u2019s not so much an American crisis, but it is, because we are all connected. And of course, we have refugees coming here. You told me last night a story about a woman from Greece. Yeah. Did you want me to tell that? Yeah. Yeah. It stays with me. And actually, her daughter is here in the \u2014 somewhere, which is amazing and reminded me of it. I should preface it by saying another thing about my father. My father had been a Tuskegee airman, and after the war, they found it very difficult to find work as pilots. No one would hire them as pilots even though they were considered among the best that had come out of the war. And so he had to remake himself yet again. And in doing that, he chose a totally different path. He became a civil engineer. So my father was literally a builder of bridges. And I carry that tradition and that part of him into the work that I do. And it\u2019s only in the time that this book has come out that I realize that. That\u2019s the reason why I constantly made these \u2014 this gesture throughout the book to immigrants, to recognizing that the people of the Great Migration, these African Americans, who many people have been told they have nothing in common with, they\u2019re totally different, they\u2019re this or they\u2019re that, actually did the very same thing that the ancestors of so many people in this country did. But in any case, when the book first came out, I didn\u2019t know how that was going to play out. And I was giving a talk on Long Island on a really bitterly rainy day, but it was an extremely \u2014 it was a wonderful turnout. And at the end of the talk, there was a very long signing line. The book had just been out, so there was a lot of excitement. And at the front of the signing line was this very diminutive woman, grandmotherly figure. She had somehow elbowed her way to the front of the line. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but there she was. She \u2014 her arms were filled with books that she had bought. She wanted me to sign them. But her eyes were red. And she was saying, \u201CI just cannot talk about this book.\u201D She said, \u201CI just \u2014 I read the book, but I just cannot talk about this book.\u201D She said, \u201CIf I start talking about the book, I going to cry for sure.\u201D She said, \u201CI can\u2019t talk about this book because this book is my story.\u201D She said, \u201CI\u2019m an immigrant from Greece, and this is my story.\u201D And her name was Anna Stefanidis. And I don\u2019t think she would mind if I mentioned it. I ended up going \u2014 I was just so floored by that. We got our pictures taken. It was such a lovely moment. And she said she was going to have the rest of her family read it. I then had an event in Brooklyn; she showed up at that again. We \u2014 she was in tears. I was in tears. We have never really spoken because we\u2019re always just in tears. And that was that bridge across the artificial barriers. That\u2019s a communing across the expanse. It was this beautiful coming together that was \u2014 so many things have come as a result of this book, and it\u2019s won so many various awards and notes, but that was, actually, within my heart, my hope, that it could cross boundaries. And I\u2019ve had many, many, many experiences like that. And I think, as a reader, what this opens up in the imagination is the lives of beauty and struggle and nobility that are in those crowds that we see. And you stop being able to see them as crowds, as abstractions, refugees. I want to read \u2014 there\u2019s so much else we could talk about. I want to read, actually, the last paragraph of the book and just reflect with you a little bit on that. \u201COver the decades, perhaps the wrong questions have been asked about the Great Migration. Perhaps it is not a question of whether the migrants brought good or will so the cities they fled to or were pushed or pulled to their destinations, but a question of how they summoned the courage to leave in the first place or how they found the will to press beyond the forces against them and the faith in a country that had rejected them for so long. By their actions, they did not dream the American Dream, they willed it into being by a definition of their own choosing. They did not ask to be accepted but declared themselves the Americans that perhaps few others recognized but that they had always been deep within their hearts.\u201D So you trace these stories of these individuals, these particular stories of this universal drama, and I wonder \u2014 and you really \u2014 as you said, you channel these people in your brain. And heart. And heart. And so how \u2014 what did you learn, what do you carry around with you about what it means to be human through these lives that you carry with you now? Well, I really \u2014 I came to believe and to know that we all have so much more in common than we\u2019ve been led to believe and that we\u2019ve been sadly, tragically assigned roles as if we\u2019re in a play, and this is what these people do, and this is what these people do, and this is what these people do. And the tragedy is that, regardless of which assignment that you had been put into, that might not have been your strength at all. And I just have gained in such \u2014 the thing is, this has been out for 6 years. I spent 15 years on it, researching and writing it. I have never grown weary of talking about it. Every time I talk about it, I gain new appreciation and gratitude and amazement at what they were able to do. One of the things that I hope to do was to bring invisible people into the light. They never were being written about. We just skip from the Civil War to Civil Rights, and this entire part of our country\u2019s history and their lives, generations, actually, of people skipped over and not recognized. And I felt that it deserved its own place and recognition. I believe that bringing the invisible people into the light would help all of us to understand and see ourselves better because we\u2019ve been so affected by what they did. And what these people did \u2014 by sheer force of will, they were able to make the Emancipation Proclamation live up to its name in their individual lives to the degree that they could. It means that they were able to do what a president, Abraham Lincoln, was not fully able to do. And they were able to what the powers that be North and South were not really fully able to do. And they \u2014 it was about their agency, and their making a decision for themselves, and declaring themselves to be citizens, which they had always been, but it had never been really, truly recognized. And I wanted to tell you that \u2014 I was talking about these people from other different backgrounds who feel such a connection to them, to the people. A woman whose \u2014 she said Ida Mae reminded her \u2014 was exactly like her Norwegian grandmother. But one of the very unusual things that has happened that seems appropriate for the conversation that we\u2019re having is that so many children or grandchildren, children primarily, of the Great Migration have come up to me and told me with a sense of healing and completion that this book was the last book that their parent read before they died. And you would think that it would be incredibly tragic and sad, but it\u2019s the exact opposite. The children were grateful that their parents had had the chance to read this before it was too late. Remember, these were people who didn\u2019t talk about their experiences. But it\u2019s also \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I mean, these three \u2014 you show how people continued to create lives, full lives, even with these circumstances and through these circumstances. And you don\u2019t know how to react when someone says, \u201CThis is the last book that my mother or father read before they died.\u201D But they say it with such joy and gratitude. And they say that it allowed them to come to terms with all that they had endured, and to give their suffering some meaning, and to recognize that they had not been alone, but that they had been a part of something bigger, some connection to immigrants around the world, other people who had come up from the South as they had, and others who had been able to express their freedom and their individuality in the way they had chosen, that it was a peaceful and, in their view, fulfilling and healing way to have left this planet. There\u2019s something you said \u2014 oh, you spoke about how part of what drives you as an aspiration \u201Cis to find strength in the discovery of what is true.\u201D And I think what you\u2019re describing is, however hard the truth is, it does complete us. It is a necessary path to healing. Well, obviously, I\u2019m not the first to say it, but it seems to set some people free. Well, that\u2019s a great last word. Isabel Wilkerson, thank you so much. And what a delight it\u2019s been. Thank you. Isabel Wilkerson was awarded the National Humanities Medal this year by President Obama \u201Cfor championing the stories of an unsung history.\u201D Her book, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction and has won many other accolades. I interviewed her as part of the inaugural Faith in Literature Festival at the University of North Carolina Asheville in partnership with public radio station WCQS and the Wake Forest School of Divinity."
