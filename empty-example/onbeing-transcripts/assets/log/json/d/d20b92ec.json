  "fullText": "If this American political moment is in part, as the Civil Rights elder Ruby Sales said to me, a \u201Ccrisis of whiteness,\u201D then whiteness is something I want to be discussing. I\u2019m joined by the writer Eula Biss. In 2015, she authored an essay in The New York Times that I could not stop thinking about, called \u201CWhite Debt.\u201D She reflected on race in America through the metaphor of going into debt while buying a house \u2014 how surprisingly comfortable debt can be in the right circumstances, and how easily we forget that we have not quite paid for what we feel we possess. She\u2019s been thinking and writing about the matter of being white and raising white children in a multi-racial world for a long time. She helpfully opens up words and ideas like complacence, guilt, and something related to privilege called \u201Copportunity hoarding.\u201D To be in this uncomfortable conversation with Eula Biss is to realize how such words alone, taken seriously, can shake us up in necessary ways \u2013 but also how the limits of words make these conversations at once more messy and more urgent. I do think that when it comes to racism, we pay too much attention to language, and we give language a power that I don\u2019t believe it actually has. And that a lot of our policing of offensive language \u2014 it\u2019s not that people should be allowed to say whatever they want, but I feel that there\u2019s extra energy put into that policing because we aren\u2019t sure how to address the real problems. And about how we live together as opposed to just how we talk together. Yeah. I think if you can\u2019t talk about something, you can\u2019t think about something. And I\u2019ve worked with students who could barely let themselves think, they were so scared of thinking the wrong thing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Eula Biss is a professor in the English department at Northwestern University and is best known for her book On Immunity. She\u2019s also the author of Notes From No Man\u2019s Land, which deals in part with her experience growing up in a multi-racial family. I really want to focus \u2014 I want to frame our conversation around ideas that you pulled together so compellingly in this article you wrote in The New York Times in December 2015 called \u201CWhite Debt: Reckoning with what is owed \u2014 and what can never be repaid \u2014 for racial privilege.\u201D I realized, as I read what you\u2019ve been writing for a long time \u2014 you\u2019ve actually been living and thinking around this subject for a long time. And in fact, as you wrote in your Notes from No Man\u2019s Land, it very much centers around themes of race, and you actually have, in your family, a cousin who\u2019s of mixed race. There are mixed race adoptions in your family. In fact, most of our families, if we traced them fully, we would probably find this. But your mother\u2019s long-time boyfriend when you were a teenager was African-American. Yeah. This is something that \u2014 I do try to resist the idea that there\u2019s something unique or special about the kind of racial makeup of my family because I feel like that supports this idea that only people who are racially other have an entryway into race. And so that\u2019s \u2014 I guess that\u2019s my preamble to the answer. Well, yeah. And the answer is that I think you\u2019re right. I think most American families are in one way or another somewhat racially complicated. Mine was maybe especially so. And yeah, my household when I was growing up was mixed. And my stepsister was black, my stepfather was black. So I was exposed, I guess, to people from a lot of different backgrounds, but I don\u2019t think that that is, in America, all that unusual either. Yeah. And I find \u2014 one thing I love about this article you wrote and about your writing in general is that you interrogate words, just individual words, language, that always appears in this conversation that we don\u2019t really know how to have, interrogating language as a way of searching for a better understanding so that \u201Cwhiteness\u201D is there. And then one of the other words that you take apart \u2014 you say that the word \u201Ccomplacence,\u201D as you looked at the roots of that word, the etymology of that word, that in fact it did not mean what you expected it to mean, and that also is a way to reflect on this. I was looking for a word that would describe a kind of blindness that wasn\u2019t even willful. And when I looked at the meaning of the word \u201Ccomplacent,\u201D it actually looked more intentional than the meaning I was searching for. Because I think that that\u2019s part of the problem is the attitude is highly unintentional. It\u2019s highly unexamined. It\u2019s relaxing into your own privilege without even thinking about it. And that, again, is one of the privileges of being white, is that you can coast through your experience, you can coast through your life without having to think about what your race means to other people, and what your existence in a community means to the people around you. Yeah. You cite this essay by Claudia Rankine that she wrote in The New York Times Magazine after the Charleston \u2014 the massacre in the church in Charleston. She wrote, \u201CI asked another friend what it\u2019s like being the mother of a black son. \u2018The condition of black life is mourning,\u2019 she said bluntly \u2014\u201D mourning, M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G \u2014 \u201CFor her, mourning lived in real time inside her and her son\u2019s reality. At any moment, she might lose her reason for living. Though the white liberal imagination likes to feel temporarily bad about black suffering, there really is no mode of empathy that can replicate the daily strain of knowing that as a black person you can be killed for simply being black: no hands in your pockets, no playing music, no sudden movements, no driving your car, no walking at night, no walking in the day, no turning onto this street, no entering this building, no standing your ground, no standing here, no standing there, no talking back, no playing with toy guns, no living while black.\u201D And you wrote, \u201CSitting with her essay in front of me, I asked myself what the condition of white life might be.\u201D I know that word \u201Ccomplacence\u201D is something that you reflected on, but I wonder how would you think about that question right now, what the condition of white life might be, how to start to summarize that or to evoke that. Yeah. Well, I guess my mind, it goes right to the particulars. And that moment that you read made me think of a meeting that I was recently in at my son\u2019s elementary school, I think, because of Claudia\u2019s friend talking about her son, and the question of how to keep him safe. And I was at a meeting that was parents discussing how we were going to bring the issue of talking about race to the school community. And there was a huge range of experience in this room. There were parents who had not talked to their children about race at all, and there were parents for whom it was a daily concern. And there was a Kenyan woman there who was saying that the way her children looked every day had everything to do with how dangerous she understood it to be black in America. And she talked about the way she dressed her two children, and the way she taught them to talk to strangers, and the way she taught them to act in public. And I was thinking about how few of those concerns I had shared, especially around safety in terms of \u2014 I haven\u2019t spent time training my son in ways of being polite, for instance, because I\u2019m afraid that someone will kill him. And that doesn\u2019t directly answer your question, but it points back towards the state of white life, or the state we\u2019re in. Yeah. I live in a placid, kind of high-functioning, Leave It to Beaver neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, the kind of neighborhood where you can \u2014 I moved here because your kids can get on their bicycle on a Saturday morning and not come back until dinnertime. You don\u2019t ever worry about them. But right around the corner from my house, like five blocks from my house, Philando Castile was shot. But the fact that we have to talk about this with our kids, because somehow, even though we are inhabiting our cities together, we\u2019re not having the same experience. It\u2019s very complicated and disturbing when you start to look at it that way. It is. It really is. And this fall, an article came out in Bloomberg News that was making the rounds of conversation in my neighborhood. It was an article about Evanston Township High School, which is the high school that serves everyone in Evanston. So it\u2019s necessarily a highly integrated high school. And a series of studies, one of them done at Stanford and another done within the Evanston school districts, found that in these integrated schools that we have in Evanston, black students and white students are not getting the same education. And so this is even within the same buildings, with the same teachers, within the same physical space. And I think it\u2019s still unclear exactly what the nature of the problem is, but one of the phrases that came up in this article \u2014 that one of the researchers used a phrase \u201Copportunity hoarding.\u201D And they use this phrase to describe what white parents do to make sure that their students \u2014 that their children are getting more than other children are getting. And I really thought about both the opportunity hoarding that I had seen around me and the opportunity hoarding that I, myself, had engaged in. And one example of opportunity hoarding that I\u2019m just remembering from this article was that, for instance, something a little over 90 percent of white students at Evanston Township High School have taken at least one advanced placement class. And the numbers for African-American students are around 50 percent. So there\u2019s many more white students \u2014 disproportionate amount of white students ending up in advanced placement classes. And there\u2019s probably a lot of factors that feed into that. There\u2019s parent advocacy, there\u2019s probably some racial bias going on on the part of the school, there\u2019s probably dozens of different factors. But I think the reason that that term \u201Copportunity hoarding\u201D spoke to me is I thought, well, that\u2019s something I can control for. Like, that\u2019s something I can watch in my own behavior. And that\u2019s something that I could have conversations with my neighbors around, and how we\u2019re treating the opportunities that are available to our children, and whether we\u2019re ensuring that those opportunities are available to all the children in our community. And don\u2019t you think, also \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s a kind of \u2014 it\u2019s an unsettling phrase, \u201Copportunity hoarding.\u201D Yeah. Oh, deeply. Yeah. But it also \u2014 right? And when it comes to our children, we\u2019re so \u2014 there\u2019s such a fierce drive that we have to give them the best, to make things possible for them. It doesn\u2019t even \u2014 it\u2019s not, I think, consciously about wanting them to flourish at the expense of someone else. But what you\u2019re pointing out and what that language makes clear is that, in fact, that is what happens. And maybe I\u2019m wrong that it\u2019s always unconscious. No. And I think that \u2014 yeah. And that especially when we\u2019re talking about limited resources, if those limited resources are hoarded, it necessarily means somebody isn\u2019t getting them. So this thinking got refreshed for me when I bought a house here in Evanston. And buying a house and getting a mortgage inspired me to do a little bit of research into housing laws and the history of redlining in my community, and the history of housing discrimination and mortgage discrimination in Chicago. And Ta-Nehisi Coates has written really beautifully about this, especially in his piece, \u201CThe Case For Reparations.\u201D He very elegantly lays out a history of legalized housing discrimination. And to some of his examples, his particulars come from Chicago. And when you look at that history, you can see a highly-intentional and entirely legal history of white people hoarding both real estate and financial resources like mortgages at the expense of other people. And even in the case of predatory lending, there\u2019s people making money at the expense of African-American families who lose their houses because of the unfair loans that they\u2019ve been given, the poor terms of lending. So buying a house was another moment where I felt that I was kind of forced to reflect on how I was benefiting personally from a long history of racist policies in my country. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the writer Eula Biss and we\u2019re talking about \u201Cwhiteness.\u201D I was just speaking with Isabel Wilkerson, who wrote The Warmth of Other Suns, and very much to that point, she talks about when there was this exodus of 6 million African Americans in the 20th century from the South to the North. They were still \u2014 they could only live in certain places, and those certain places turn out to now be our inner cities. And were charged exorbitant rates because they had no choice. And that is built in the DNA of our cities, you\u2019re right. I mean, you started \u2014 the buying of the house was kind of the image that you worked with in this New York Times piece, and really delving into the meaning of debt and the experience of debt. And moral debt as well. Yeah. The moral debt. What really broke that piece open \u2014 I knew for a long time that I wanted to write about the feelings I was having around buying and owning a house and getting a mortgage. But what broke that piece open was a conversation with my neighbors who had lived in Germany. And one of my neighbors mentioned to me that the word for \u201Cdebt\u201D in German is also the word for \u201Cguilt.\u201D And kind of that was very illuminating for me. And I have, for a long time, wanted to think about white guilt in a way that could be productive, both personally productive, but also socially and politically productive. It\u2019s a really \u2014 as a term, \u201Cwhite guilt\u201D is pretty poisonous. Or even the notion of white privilege. Well, what I experience \u2014 we\u2019re very attentive to editorially when we put shows on the air around race around these issues that you could \u2014 you want people to listen. And I personally don\u2019t think people get paralyzed or turn away because they don\u2019t care. I mean, maybe it\u2019s true that sometimes they don\u2019t care, but there\u2019s a paralysis that sets in, right? It\u2019s about, \u201CI don\u2019t know what to do with this. I don\u2019t know how to make it better.\u201D And I think that\u2019s one reason one doesn\u2019t put \u201Cguilt\u201D in a show title. Right. Yeah. But you make a really interesting \u2014 I think you\u2019re arguing for saying not letting guilt be a bad word, a kind of honoring the fact that \u2014 I mean, you wrote, \u201CWhy not imagine guilt as a prod, a goad, an impetus to action? Isn\u2019t guilt an essential cog in the machinery of the conscience?\u201D Maybe we should try to let this word in, welcome this word in this conversation about race. Like, I honestly think we talk about race when we talk about how we don\u2019t know how to talk about it. It\u2019s not even really like we do have a national conversation about race. And maybe because we don\u2019t let the word guilt in. I mean, maybe that\u2019s \u2014 this is important. Yeah. And I do think \u2014 circling it back to this question of, \u201CWhat\u2019s the state of white life?\u201D I do think the state of white life is that we\u2019re living in a house we believe we own but that we\u2019ve never paid off. I also think that maybe the language that people could find more palatable \u2014 it would be this word \u201Cresponsibility,\u201D this word that we associate with adulthood and drudgery. Yeah, rather than shame. But that\u2019s another coloration of guilt, is that there\u2019s that meaning of the word \u201Cguilt\u201D that gestures at responsibility. Because I am culpable for this, I am now responsible for\u2026 Culpable for and benefiting from, right? Yes. Exactly. And benefitting from \u2014 I think a lot of people want to wash their hands because the benefit has been indirect, right? Mm-hmm. And I think it\u2019s \u2014 in a lot of cases, the culpability can feel indirect too, but it doesn\u2019t make it right. Right. Absolutely. I have the unusual situation of living in a house \u2014 the house that we bought here in Evanston has an identical twin that\u2019s right next door to it. So we live in a little brick bungalow that is right next door to an identical brick bungalow. And these two brick bungalows were built by brothers, and neither of those brothers live in the houses anymore. But our next-door neighbor is an African-American man who\u2019s been living in his house since I was born. And so we have \u2014 we\u2019re a white family living in a house that\u2019s identical to the house of the black family next door, which has given me some occasions for reflection on the differences in our lives and the ways that we have or have not benefited from the systemic racism around us. So one example of that is before we moved into our house, the previous owner did a major renovation of the attic of this little bungalow. And I was describing this renovation to my next-door neighbor over the fence, and he said, \u201CI\u2019d love to do something like that to my attic. I would love to do it. I want so much to renovate our attic. I always have wanted to.\u201D And he said, \u201CBut I\u2019m never going to have the money for that.\u201D And this is a man who\u2019s worked his whole life. He\u2019s worked for the post office for longer than I\u2019ve been alive. And he mentioned to me in an offhand way, he said, \u201CYou know, I have a lot of family members who are in jail and who are in prison, and that\u2019s one of the draws on us financially, is supporting the families of people who can\u2019t work.\u201D And so that\u2019s just one tiny window into how the criminalization of black life is a draw financially on people who are not engaging in any activity, who have never been accused of a crime, never put in jail, never imprisoned. And then can\u2019t renovate their attics to increase the price of their property and all of that. Exactly. And my neighbor left off this conversation \u2014 we were talking, and he left off by saying, \u201CI guess God just didn\u2019t want me to be rich.\u201D And I said, \u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s God, actually.\u201D Right. You can listen again and share this conversation with Eula Biss through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, we\u2019re talking about \u201Cwhiteness\u201D \u2014 an awkward, inadequate, and urgent conversation for American life now. I\u2019m with the author Eula Biss, who caught my attention with her essay in The New York Times, \u201CWhite Debt,\u201D about the moral and material debt we owe each other. It feels so good to talk about this. There\u2019s a sentence you had in the \u201CWhite Debt\u201D piece: \u201CI have written and erased 100 sentences here trying and failing to articulate something that I can sense, but not yet speak.\u201D And I may be reading into this, but the truth is this is all so fraught. And there are so many things kind of coming to the surface that, in part, feel very shocking, whether they should be shocking or not \u2014 violence, and kind of seeing the roots of things we haven\u2019t seen. And there\u2019s \u2014 I think one reason I appreciate that you work with the language \u2014 because language itself is so fraught, and the wrong word can be taken as an offense, even though we\u2019re reckless with other words. Right. Yeah, I do \u2014 I think that this is a major problem for us in terms of talking about race. And as attentive as I am to languages, and as sensitive as I am to it as a writer, and as much as I believe that insight can be found or lost through language, I do think that when it comes to racism, we pay too much attention to language, and we give language a power that I don\u2019t believe it actually has. When in fact, I think there are many graver actions that are happening that happen without anyone ever saying anything offensive. And that a lot of our policing of offensive language \u2014 it\u2019s not that that is unimportant, it\u2019s not that people should be allowed to say whatever they want, but I feel that there\u2019s extra energy put into that policing because we aren\u2019t sure how to address the real problems, and how to address the kind of systemic racism that happens without anyone ever saying anything that would look to us like racism. And I think that this is part of how we\u2019re hobbling ourselves around, coming to kind of broader and more advanced understandings around what\u2019s going on with race. And about how we live together as opposed to just how we talk together, how to speak together. Yeah. We can\u2019t \u2014 I think if you can\u2019t talk about something, you can\u2019t think about something. And I think \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with students who could barely, barely let themselves think, they were so scared of thinking the wrong thing. And so, I don\u2019t want to be misunderstood as making an argument for offensive language. But I guess the argument that I\u2019m making is that I think that we need a cultural atmosphere where we understand where the crimes are happening, and that many of the crimes are not in the arena of language, but that we need to be able to stumble through imperfect language and imperfect sentences in order to find our way to where the crimes are happening. I have a friend who\u2019s in her late 70s and she was a professor \u2014 is a professor. And she told me a story about in the mid \u201860s when Civil Rights was happening. She had a close friend who was also a colleague, a fellow academic, who was African-American, and that they had a pact that \u2014 or that Pauline had a kind of agreement with her that she would bounce things off her that she was going to say or write, and say, \u201CIs this racist? Does this work? Is this offensive?\u201D And I love that story because it was self-correction in the context of a relationship. And she was safe enough to ask to be corrected, as opposed to so worried about getting something wrong that she wouldn\u2019t say anything. And I feel like we\u2019ve had this illusion here in our 21st century that we\u2019re way past that, right? Like, we should know what the wrong word would be, or what the offensive thought would be, or what the egregious omission would be. And we don\u2019t. I mean, sadly, we should, but we don\u2019t. And I\u2019ve wished \u2014 what if we could each have a friendship like that, a safe space where we could err and ask to be \u2014 have it pointed out lovingly so that we could get it right. Yeah. And this is another way in which I really, really strongly believe that for all the ways that white people benefit materially from racism, that we\u2019re very damaged by it. And I think that this is one of the ways in which we\u2019re damaged. And the racist structures of our society cut us off from close friendships with people of color. And that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have them, but there\u2019s many ways in which we\u2019re alienated from each other. And that\u2019s one of the things we lose, that kind of productive conversation that can move a person\u2019s thinking forward and can expand a person\u2019s \u2014 not just their acceptable vocabulary, but also their real understanding. Yeah, their understanding and their presence in the world, their ability to move forward. It\u2019s also another very striking thing about this moment we inhabit is we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019re aware of all this unfinished business, these things we actually thought we\u2019d made so much progress on, but also seeing full circle that the legacy of whiteness is now costing white people \u2014 the foreclosure crisis, or opiate addiction, or the white pain in the presidential campaign. There\u2019s a way in which a lot of what happened to people of color is now afflicting white people as well. These systems didn\u2019t stay closed. The structures didn\u2019t stay closed. Yeah. I think where I see it is in fractured alliances. So, these disaffected, poor white people see themselves as white before they understand themselves as poor. So there\u2019s a potentially very powerful alliance between poor whites and poor blacks in our country, and that alliance has been undermined. And prevents flourishing, right? Prevents\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 It would be life-giving for those fractures to soften and fall away. Yeah. And ultimately, I think who it benefits is a very tiny, tiny, little segment of the society. I guess we\u2019re really \u2014 this is another way of talking about the 1 percent, right? But part of how we\u2019ve empowered the 1 percent is by allowing other people to think that by virtue of their race, they might have access to the 1 percent, that all they need to do is work hard enough, and try hard enough, and be good enough, and that they might get to belong at some point. Or their children might get to belong at some point. Or their children might. Yeah. I want to come back to raising our children, and of course, that\u2019s a primary place we can walk with this differently. You write very beautifully about \u2014 you\u2019ve written in many ways about raising your son, the ordinary joys of life. You did mention a while ago how you wrote in that Times piece on white debt about \u2014 I think this must be what you were talking about. Somebody took exception to that when your son was 4, he brought home a library book about the slaves who built the White House. I\u2019m just going to read this. \u201CI didn\u2019t tell him that slaves once accounted for more wealth than all the industry in this country combined, or that slaves were, as Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, \u2018the down payment\u2019 on this country\u2019s independence, or that freed slaves became, after the Civil War, \u2018this country\u2019s second mortgage.\u2019 Nonetheless, my overview of slavery and Jim Crow left my son worried about what it meant to be white, what legacy he had inherited. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be on this team,\u2019 he said, with his head in his hands. \u2018You might be stuck on this team,\u2019 I told him, \u2018but you don\u2019t have to play by its rules.\u2019\u201D Yeah. And that \u201Cyou don\u2019t have to play by its rules\u201D part is, of course, easier said than done. And I think that that, for me, is an ongoing parenting challenge, but it\u2019s also a challenge for me as an adult living an adult life is \u2014 where and when do I refuse the rules? Where and when do I defy expectations that are written into the social code? Yes. I\u2026 And I think this is \u2014 for me, it\u2019s tricky because rules are so important for both parenting and for education. So, our children\u2019s lives are a little nets of rules. And so I think that it\u2019s actually a pretty complicated, nuanced conversation to talk about \u2014 how do you discern whether a rule is unjust or not? And when do you choose to violate it? You were talking a little while ago about the study about high schools and AP classes. So I was thinking as you were talking about that \u2014 my son went to a great big urban high school in St. Paul. And we liked that about it, that it was a big urban high school, and it was diverse. But an African-American \u2014 a new friend of mine who\u2019s African-American talked about taking his son to visit that school and being there at lunchtime. And being there at lunchtime and seeing this high school cafeteria where kids \u2014 where you have all these high school kids being high school kids. And they\u2019re laughing, and they\u2019re talking, and it was very mixed. And then the bell rings, and the white kids head up the stairs to the AP and IB classes, and hardly any black kids. And so you have this stark segregation. And what feels so shameful, to me, is that I \u2014 I mean, my son has graduated now, and he had graduated by the point that I heard this story, and I knew that there wasn\u2019t \u2014 that there was a segregation going on that I didn\u2019t understand and I didn\u2019t like, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 like, why? It is our job as white parents, as much as it\u2019s the job of the parents of the kids of color, to not let this continue. Right. Yes. And that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve been very inspired by a number of things that I\u2019ve read in a journal that\u2019s no longer being published called Race Traitor. And this was published by Noel Ignatiev, the author of How The Irish Became White. And John Garvey published this journal for years. And one of the stories I read in there was about a group of parents who protested the selection processes in their school that produced a gifted program in a school that was majority black. The gifted program was majority white. And so white parents protested this, saying this can\u2019t possibly be the case. Not all the gifted children in the school can be white. So there must be a problem with how we\u2019re deciding who gets into the gifted program. There must be something wrong here. And I do think that that\u2019s our job as white parents, is to see that and know it can\u2019t be true. And then to try to \u2014 whatever that system is that\u2019s producing a gifted program that is entirely white at a school that\u2019s mostly black, to dismantle that system. Again, easier said than done. But I do think that there are \u2014 in these particular cases, there are things that can be done if people say, \u201CWe won\u2019t have this.\u201D I was also really inspired by a story that I heard on public radio here in Chicago a couple years ago about a group of students at a very wealthy public school in Lincoln Park. And these students were \u2014 many of them were white students who were protesting the fact that their school was going to get a major renovation that would cost a lot of money. And they were protesting on the grounds that they didn\u2019t think their school was the most in need of the public schools in the city. And they thought that it was unjust that city funds would be going towards their school when there were schools that didn\u2019t have enough textbooks to go around. And I also found that story quite exciting and thought, \u201COK we\u2019re getting somewhere here.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the writer Eula Biss, and we\u2019re talking about \u201Cwhiteness.\u201D As you\u2019re out there talking about this and as you\u2019ve gotten a reaction to the \u201CWhite Debt\u201D piece, is there a difference in how \u2014 like, how do people of color respond? Do you hear from non-white people about this thinking? Yeah, I do. I do. I\u2019m not sure this is answering your question, but I guess one of the things that surprised me in terms of response to my own work was that, for the most part, my writing about race did not seem to make a lot of people very upset. And that worried me a little bit, actually, to tell you the truth. Yeah. And actually, I think that\u2019s somewhat true, especially \u2014 if you\u2019re a writer in this subject matter, you\u2019re probably not doing your job unless people are pissed off and angry. I mean, that\u2019s a diagnosis of a problem, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I wonder if \u2014 you\u2019re just being kind of straight. You\u2019re saying, \u201CLet\u2019s talk about whiteness.\u201D You\u2019re framing the question a little differently. Gosh, we\u2019ve got to have a place for speaking honestly that is not that controversial, even if it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s experience. And so I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Yeah. One of the things I\u2019ve observed in education \u2014 and this is something we \u2014 I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s talked about a lot in education \u2014 is that learning can be really, really upsetting. And I do think that it\u2019s fair to expect that in a conversation that\u2019s as difficult as this, there will be flashes of defensiveness, of anger, of bitterness, of ferocious resentment. And that I guess the space has to contain that. There\u2019s something hopeful about taking in fury as a function of learning. I actually \u2014 maybe it\u2019s because I have a terrible temper myself, but I actually \u2014 I\u2019m inclined to embrace fury in not just in an academic setting, but in a conversation in general. And any essential conversation, I think, probably has the potential to set off some anger. So we live in this \u2014 we also \u2014 another aspect of this moment is that I hear language, and not just language, but intentions surfacing words like \u201Ctruth\u201D and \u201Creconciliation\u201D commissions for race, \u201Cmercy.\u201D I mean, using words like \u201Cmercy\u201D in conversations about public policy. Words like \u201Credemption\u201D I feel are coming in. And you have reflected on \u2014 and I feel like this is a new opening to say, \u201CHow do we live redemptively, reparatively, rather than destructively?\u201D What does that look like? How does it start? And again, you and I are speaking as two white people that \u2014 but we have to craft and kind of discover that new way of living kind of one life and one action at a time. Yeah, though I find this super embarrassing to talk out loud about, really, like\u2026 No, it feels really scary, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. And I\u2019m already pre-mortified about any of this being on the air, on the radio. As much as I think I\u2019m allowing this embarrassment to just wash over me \u2014 because I still really deeply, fundamentally believe in bumbling your way through a conversation about this subject because I think it is so important. We just cannot be silent on this subject. Because it is so inadequate, is what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s very inadequate. Yeah, I feel like \u2014 and I also, as we talk, I just feel super aware of my own partial understanding. And I feel like I\u2019m constantly touching the edges of my own comprehension. And I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m really not getting it all. And so \u2014 yeah. So it feels just very uncomfortable. And intensely mortifying. But I think to your point, also, we need to also allow ourselves to have inadequate conversations, and not think that we have to begin by getting it right, or perfect, or complete, because it\u2019s not possible. As you said, we\u2019re talking about generation upon generation, and things that have been conscious and unconscious, and we don\u2019t know how much we carry around unconsciously. That\u2019s something we\u2019re learning about ourselves. Yeah. The very first question my son ever asked me about race \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long after he started talking. So he was somewhere between 2 and 3, and he asked me \u2014 I was anticipating a question like this, but I did not anticipate the form it took. He asked me why a friend of his had brown skin. And I was expecting a question like that. But what was surprising was that the friend he asked about was someone who would be considered white. And I think her background is Romanian, but she\u2019s \u2014 her features are European. And she moves through the world as a white person and so does her mother. But her skin is, in fact, darker than the skin of a number of other people we knew who would be classified as black. So the very first question my son asked me about race was much more complicated than the question I\u2019d been anticipating. What he was asking me is, \u201CWhy is this person with dark skin called \u2018white\u2019 when there\u2019s people with lighter skin who we call \u2018black?\u2019\u201D What he was really getting at is a question that went straight to the inconsistencies in how we define race in this country. And\u2026 And some of the absurdity of it. Some of the absurdity of it. Somewhere, you pose these two questions together, or these two ideas: the things we do to each other out of fear, the things we owe each other. Say a little bit more about what would be on your list of the things we owe each other. Well, again, I think this is, in some ways, very personal for me because I do ask this question of myself, for myself, all the time. But again, one of my kind of private conclusions for my own self \u2014 and this has to do with fear, but it\u2019s slightly different \u2014 is that I do feel that we owe each other trust until that trust is broken. And I think that that can be in practice incredibly difficult. We live in a political climate in a political atmosphere that makes trust extremely difficult. And it can even seem quite foolish, actually, to trust in this particular climate. And I think there\u2019s people who would disagree with me on this, and probably rightly. So I guess that\u2019s just my way of saying that I\u2019m not entirely sure that what I\u2019m saying is right. I\u2019m maybe even partly convinced I\u2019m wrong on this. But it\u2019s still something that I\u2019ve come to that is important to me is that in my every day interactions with other people, I feel that trust is something of a radical act. And I go to great efforts to trust the people around me. And do you find that that is a risk that has rewards is to talk about the paradigm of where \u2014 I mean, do you find that many people in situations rise to that occasion? That it\u2019s worth it for you to go through it, erring on the side of trust? For me, it has been. For me, it\u2019s a rewarding way to live. That doesn\u2019t mean that people haven\u2019t disappointed me and broken my trust. But it tends \u2014 when that happens to me, it tends to be in situations where I never would have anticipated it. And I feel like this does come back to the question of fear. I think there\u2019s some people who feel that nurturing their own fear will be a balm against danger. If you just feel fearful enough and often enough, you\u2019ll save yourself from the dangers of the world. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think you get hurt either way. Right. So you either you get to live as a suspicious, wary person, paranoid, who gets hurt, or you get to live as someone who trusts other people and gets hurt. It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a\u2026 Yeah, no, that\u2019s really helpful and\u2026 Uplifting conclusion. Yeah, and no. And in this term \u2014 in this context of whiteness, what do we owe as white people? This is a question that I do \u2014 again, I am asking myself all the time and trying to answer in actually very concrete ways. And my answer is, again, constantly evolving and constantly shifting. But I do feel that I owe action to the communities that I\u2019m a part of. And those communities are various and overlapping. But for instance, the whole reason I was in a meeting at my son\u2019s school to be involved in making race something that we\u2019re talking about in the schools, and with children, and with teachers, and when we\u2019re doing hiring, and when we\u2019re inviting guests to speak. And that\u2019s something I fail on too. And I feel that I also owe it to my neighbors not to reduce them to symbols, to see them as people and not as symbols, or ideas, or shorthand for an experience that we assume is shared, and may not be shared.
