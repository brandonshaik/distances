  "fullText": "When I told people I was going to have Glenn Beck on this show, some reacted badly. But I\u2019ve been conversing with him privately this year about what it will take to heal the divides and misunderstanding among Americans. He is a lightning\u00A0rod of our ruptures, but for several years, he\u2019s also been acknowledging his own role in the damaged state we\u2019re in. Here he is with Megyn Kelly on Fox in 2014: When you think back on your time here, how will you remember it, how do you remember it now? I remember it as an awful lot of fun and that I made an awful lot of mistakes. And I wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language because I think I played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart. Glenn Beck is a complicated person. So, after all, are we all. Speaking with him brings home the reality that if we\u2019re going to create the world we want our children to inhabit, we\u2019re going to have to find ways to hold more complexity peaceably, and probably uncomfortably, just to soften what is possible between us. We need to be ready to let others surprise us, let them repent, offer forgiveness, and ask hard questions of our own place in this moment. This doesn\u2019t happen often in politics, but it is essential in life and must be part of common life too. As part of our ongoing Civil Conversations Project, I draw out Glenn Beck in this generosity of spirit. We have to start believing the best in each other instead of expecting the worst. And I\u2019m guilty \u2014 I hate to say that because I can\u2019t imagine how many people in your audience just rolled their eyes and went, \u201CYou\u2019ve got to be \u2014 coming from Glenn Beck?\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Glenn Beck now broadcasts on The Blaze, a multi-platform news and entertainment network that he founded. His childhood in Washington state was marked by addiction in the adults around him and his mother\u2019s death when he was a teenager by apparent suicide. He rose to national popularity and prominence in radio and then live television in the glory days of cable news at CNN and Fox News. You know, it\u2019s interesting. And this must be the interesting way you live, that people feel like they know you, right? I mean, Glenn Beck is a concept. It\u2019s a really \u2014 it\u2019s both good and bad. I get credit for things that I never did and get blamed for things that I never did, just depending on who I talk to. I mean, I was just thinking about it as I started to delve into preparing to talk to you, as I do with every interview, but just that, again, Glenn Beck is a concept. And then you start getting to know the human, right? Yeah. So I just want to start where I always start my interviews, whoever I\u2019m talking to, asking about the spiritual background of your childhood. And what I want to say to you is that sometimes \u2014 I mean, everybody has a story. Sometimes it\u2019s a religious story, but I\u2019ve also come to really have an expansive understanding of what that means. And, boy, when I look at your childhood, I mean, your mother dying when you were a teenager, there was so much hardness in that. I just want to say I\u2019ve got to think that that was part of the spiritual background of your childhood and/or overshadowed it or both. I think \u2014 a couple of things. First of all, I had an encounter, at least I feel, with God when I was 8. 7, actually. And it actually kind of screwed me up quite a bit later in life. And it wasn\u2019t until 40 that I actually gave up on that. I heard when I was 7, in my own head, \u201CWhat you do in life will be a pivot point.\u201D And I didn\u2019t understand it, but it was so clear and so different. And I don\u2019t even remember why that \u2014 I mean, it was just bizarre. And then, about four weeks before my mother died, I had another spiritual brush. I was walking by my mom, whose hands were in the sink in the kitchen, and I was in the hallway. I was walking by, and I, again, heard a voice in my own head as clear as day: \u201CStop, go back, kiss your mother, and tell her you love her. She won\u2019t be here much longer.\u201D And I didn\u2019t. I dismissed it, and a few weeks later, she was dead. Then that happened with my grandfather, and then that happened with a girl that I was dating in high school. She had a headache, and I remember distinctly feeling, \u201COh my gosh, she\u2019s got a brain tumor.\u201D I just knew it. So I had, early on, a brush with the Spirit. And then that voice that I heard when I was 7 gave me an arrogance that was not good and really screwed me up. That\u2019s how you took it? That\u2019s how you think you internalized it? As an arrogance? No. Well, I took it as a \u2014 I mean, between that and then \u2014 I got into radio when I was 13. And so when you\u2019re 13 and 14 years old, and you\u2019re in Seattle Market with some of the better people in the industry, and they say, \u201CMy gosh, listen to this kid,\u201D in front of you. \u201CHave you heard this kid? I mean, when he\u2019s 25, what is he going to be like?\u201D You start buying it. And so I just had this arrogance that I just knew I was going to make an impact. And by the time I was 30, I was so screwed up that I was ready to repeat the mistakes of my mother\u2019s life. Did you have \u2014 you have a big intelligence and a huge curiosity. Did \u2014 I mean, you didn\u2019t go to college. Did you think about going to college? Was that not a possibility for you? No, it was \u2014 there was nobody in my family that ever went to college, and we couldn\u2019t afford it. And it was not \u2014 I remember being in Algebra I, and the first week in Algebra when I was \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 9th grade. And I remember raising my hand, and I said, \u201CWhat am I ever going to use this for?\u201D And the professor said, \u201CAll kinds of stuff.\u201D And I said, \u201CUh-huh. All I know is that I need to know that 14 minutes before 8:00 is 46 minutes after the hour. That\u2019s all I \u2014 everything I do will be divisible by 60, so I don\u2019t need any of this.\u201D You were already on the clock. You were on the radio clock. I\u2019m already on the clock. So, you did kind of fast forward a minute ago. I mean, as you said, there was addiction, alcohol in your family, and you have went into that. You were very successful in radio. You\u2019ve also said that you were suicidal by the \u201890s. You\u2019ve said, \u201CI was a bad man. I was a deplorable human being.\u201D Did you get into recovery then in the late \u201890s? Is that\u2026? No. No? Oh, yeah. Late \u201890s, yes. The first time I battled depression was in the \u201880s, and I have such empathy for people who are battling with depression. If you\u2019ve never really battled with chemical depression, you just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s \u2014 the world turns inside out. What is black turns white, what is reasonable to you is completely unreasonable to everybody else. And you get to this place to where you\u2019re like, \u201CThe world is a much better place\u201D \u2014 and there are a lot of people that probably still would believe this \u2014 \u201CThe world would be a much better place without me in it.\u201D And you start to believe that. That language you used a minute ago, \u201Cpivot point\u201D \u2014 your life is full of those. That\u2019s language you use. And I think, when I look at your story and at you, there\u2019s a lot of change; there\u2019s a lot of momentum; there\u2019s a fair amount of conversion as part of your experience. When I\u2019ve talked to people about the fact that I was going to interview you, and when I read some of these articles that you have written, there\u2019s this skeptical edge. \u201CWell, now he\u2019s saying something different, but will he stay this way?\u201D Like, when I look at your story, the sweep of it, you\u2019ve never stayed the same way. No. Life is about change. And so it seems to me \u2014 so you did go through this very dark period, and you got into recovery. I mean, it seems to me, that was a big pivot point for you, and it was kind of around the turn of the century. Is that right? Yeah, it was in the mid \u201890s. I remember \u2014 I turned 30, and I remember looking at the clock on my bed stand, and it was turning midnight in the old LED clock that the numbers would almost jump as you watched them. And I watched it say 11:59, 11:59, and then it switched to 12:00. And I remember thinking, \u201CYour whole life is going to change.\u201D And I knew that what I had built was just unsustainable. It was just lie to myself on top of lie to myself. And I read a letter right after that from Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr, and it was about how Peter should learn this about mathematics, and he should read these classics, and when languages \u2014 he should learn these things. And then it got to religion. In the last part, it said, \u201CAbove all things, when it comes to religion, fix reason firmly in her seat, and question with boldness even the very existence of God, for if there be a God, he must surely rather honest questioning over blindfolded fear.\u201D And that changed my life and still, today, is the most important thing to me \u2018cause I was going through recovery, through the 12-step program, and I was examining myself, and I was really trying to \u2014 but there were things in my life that I wouldn\u2019t go. I just wouldn\u2019t look at, like my mother\u2019s suicide and everything else. I just \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine with that.\u201D And I wouldn\u2019t ask those questions. And so what changed? I decided that I didn\u2019t really know anything. I don\u2019t know. There was a humility that happened. I had been praying for God to humble me. And boy, don\u2019t ever pray for that because that one \u2014 there\u2019s like a big bell on the other side that rings, and God\u2019s like, \u201CSomebody\u2019s praying for humility? Quick, dispatch somebody.\u201D And so I was really humbled at that time, and it wasn\u2019t frightening for some reason anymore to admit that I didn\u2019t know anything. And I think part of that is because I had become, in a different way, self-destructive. I didn\u2019t want to do radio anymore because it was just shallow and empty. And just being a morning show DJ was just awful. And so I got on the air, and somebody had said something, \u201CWell, you don\u2019t know anything, and you\u2019re Mr. Perfect.\u201D Because my image, at the time, was \u201CMr. Clean.\u201D And I said, \u201CYou know, you don\u2019t really know anything about me because I\u2019ve never let you in, but let me tell you who I am and why I know.\u201D And I laid it all out, and I said to my producer, as I turned off the mics, \u201CMark this day down on your calendar. This is the day that Glenn Beck ended his career.\u201D And that producer is still my executive producer. He\u2019s still with me. What year was that? \u201895? \u201896? \u201895. And that was on the air? You did that on the air? Yeah, and I found that the most unexpected thing happened. People would stop me and write to me in times when we still got letters and say, \u201CYou know, when you said what you said, I can relate. Nobody knows this about me, but I\u2019m carrying something.\u201D And I realized, \u201COh, my gosh, we are all hiding from something.\u201D We all have something that we think we\u2019re a fraud on, or if people only knew, or something that I\u2019m carrying around. I don\u2019t know what it is, but we all have it. And if we would just be honest with each other and just say, \u201CYeah, this is who I am,\u201D all of a sudden, it loses all of its power. Mm-hmm. But I mean, it is ironic, as you say, because it was after that point that you became this huge public figure, right? Well, that\u2019s ten years later. And I actually think that I was \u2014 in \u201896, I was still \u2014 I was rough. If you listen to my shows in even 2000, I mean, I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m LDS, so I\u2019m a member of Mormon faith. And when you, as a man, are brought into what\u2019s called the priesthood \u2014 and every man is a priest in my faith \u2014 the congregation votes on it. In fact, the whole \u2014 what\u2019s called a stake, the whole \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what you would call it \u2014 the whole diocese votes on it. And I\u2019m one of the only people that people raised their hand and went, \u201CNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201D OK. And you came \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about this, but you came to Mormonism, to the LDS church, fairly later in life. 1999. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 you weren\u2019t born into that. No, no, no. 1999. Yeah, 1999, after this. So after this period. So I went \u2014 in \u201896, I was just starting to \u2014 I took everything out, and I said \u201COK, I don\u2019t know anything. And so I went \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t afford college, I went to the Barnes and Noble, and I assembled what I like to call the library of a serial killer. I went in with the intention of, \u201CWho would argue with each other in philosophy? Who would argue with each other in religion? Who would argue with each other in\u201D \u2014 whatever it is. And so, I was putting a library together with Mein Kampf and Alan Dershowitz. I mean, crazy. And my philosophy was, if you can go to the extremes and you can go to people that should have nothing in common, if you find any point of connection, then there\u2019s truth in that. And it\u2019s led me to things like \u2014 that I think is very true \u2014 horrible to say out loud, but that\u2019s what I do for a living \u2014 Jesus and Hitler had one thing in common, and that is they could both look somebody in the eye who was hungry or in despair and say, \u201CI will feed you.\u201D And it\u2019s important to listen to what their solution is, but most people don\u2019t. And one will lead you to an evil path, and one will lead you to a good path. But it is exactly the same entry point. And we get to Glenn Beck. Are you regretting this yet? No, but I just \u2014 there\u2019s so much to talk about. But I mean, let\u2019s fast forward and go from there, go backwards and forwards from there. 2014 \u2014 you\u2019ve said versions of this to other people, but I just especially really liked just the short clip of you with Megyn Kelly in 2014. And she was asking you about your time at Fox, and you said \u2014 and I think you really surprised her \u2013 \u201CI played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart.\u201D So between this \u2014 1996, 1999, your personal pivot point, in 2014, you went to CNN. You started \u201CThe Glenn Beck Show\u201D in 2000. You got syndicated. You went to CNN. You went to Fox. You had 6.5 million listeners behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsay by 2008. Talk about what you were seeing in your career in 2014. Yeah, just start talking about that. Can I go back? Yes, and you can go back anywhere. Can I go back? Because this is really\u2026 Yeah. This is important. To understand, I didn\u2019t want to go to Fox News. I turned them down three times. I didn\u2019t want to go to Headline News. In fact, I remember the only reason why I took it is because I believed the country was in real trouble. I had just spent three years saying, \u201CThere is a financial crash coming beyond description, and this is happening now.\u201D I\u2019m talking to Fox at the same time that the financial crisis is finally there. Right, 2008, yeah. And so I was convinced that the country is in real trouble. I still am. It\u2019s just more resilient than I thought it was. And I got on, and I had no idea, A, the power of Fox, B, the danger of doing 60 minutes live unscripted every single day\u2026 Kind of wild. You were kind of wild. \u2026plus a three way radio show. Yeah, and doing it in a way that I thought would get people to watch, which it did. So I\u2019m mixing mediums, which was dangerous, but I thought, oh, everybody will get it. And then there was this mass pushback, and it wasn\u2019t good, and it just kind of pushed the wrong buttons in me, and I\u2019m like, \u201CReally?\u201D And I honestly thought that, OK, I\u2019m going to present this in a way that people will be able to watch and understand. And then, somebody in the media will pick this up and go, wait a minute, there is \u2014 I don\u2019t believe Glenn Beck, but there is something here. There is this connection that he showed, and we looked it up, and it\u2019s true. That never happened. And so what happened was, I took half the country and basically flipped them the bird. That wasn\u2019t smart. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Glenn Beck. You have also said, in 2000\u2026 Can\u2019t we quote somebody else? No, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re talking about you. OK. I understand that this is not the side of the microphone you\u2019re happiest on. Yeah, let\u2019s quote somebody else. I hate that guy. No, I\u2019m in control here, as you also understand. Yeah, OK. You\u2019ve said a lot. I know. And here\u2019s another way that I feel like you can help take other people inside something they may not understand. You\u2019ve said, \u201CI did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama.\u201D And that was \u2014 and you\u2019ve been criticized for calling him \u2014 I mean, well, we won\u2019t even go through all that. You\u2026 No, you \u2014 I mean, I understand what I\u2019ve said. Yeah, calling him racist, blah, blah. That\u2019s not what I want to do. I don\u2019t want to dissect that. That\u2019s been dissected. But when you say that, and I think you \u2014 again, you are \u2014 your audiences, people who you have been listening to, attending to, were freaking out about Barack Obama, and a lot of people don\u2019t understand that. And just\u2026 Well, could I \u2014 let me\u2026 Yeah, say something about that, about what that is. Yeah, let me just say this. This is why I have \u2014 and I\u2019ve been begging the people on the right. How can you not have empathy for the people right now who are saying, \u201CDonald Trump is going to destroy America. We are gonna be in \u2014 he\u2019s gonna have concentration camps?\u201D You were thinking that about Barack Obama. How can you not understand that somebody sees this guy, who is much more vocal and has many more tendencies than the last guy, how can you call them crazy? There are people \u2014 I\u2019m finding it fascinating that at this moment where we could have profound understanding for one another and we can say, \u201CI know, I know, I know how you\u2019re feeling, and don\u2019t make the mistake that I made. Don\u2019t do the things that we did.\u201D \u201CWell, nobody could be as bad as you.\u201D Stop it. Stop it. Let\u2019s take this moment at time and say, let\u2019s learn from the past. Let\u2019s not overreact and freak out. And believe me, I\u2019m one of the \u2014 I mean, you\u2019ve heard me over the last, what, 18 months about Donald Trump. I\u2019m warning you, grave danger. This guy could go totalitarian on us. He could very well do that. He also may very well leave the Oval Office as a decent president. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t see the future. What we should be talking about is not people, not even events, but ideas. And the idea is no one person should ever make the American public, left, right, or all of us, this afraid. And I mean, so this is another pivot point for you, I sense. And you know, Glenn, that you \u2014 \u201Cfear\u201D has been a big piece of your vocabulary and you\u2019ve proudly called yourself a catastrophist and you also understand the science of fear. You\u2019ve written about this, how our brains are hard-wired to respond to this. And there is a lot in your writing and your work about groups, right? I mean, the book you wrote in 2016 about \u201Cprogressives\u201D and just these sweeping statements about groups of people. At the same time\u2026 Hang on just a second because I want to make sure we\u2019re really careful here. OK. Did you read the book? Yeah. OK. So it\u2019s about early 20th century American progressives. Not just any progressive, but the ones who really understand what progressivism, at its core, at its founding, really is. The difference between a cattle and a rancher. That a real early 20th-century American progressive says, \u201CWe know better than the average guy, and so we\u2019ll make the decisions.\u201D I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the average progressive. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they are. I don\u2019t think they understand what an early 20th century progressive is. And so this is really a history book to be able to say this is that seed, and it\u2019s in both the Republican and the Democratic parties. Yeah. I hear you, and I believe you, but I also think there are these sweeping statements that don\u2019t contain that subtlety. Like, \u201CThis book will present a clear, concise, and documented picture of progressives as they really are, eugenicists, racists, misogynists, terrorists, and authoritarian tyrants.\u201D And it doesn\u2019t qualify. And I just think \u2014 and I don\u2019t think you disagree with this \u2014 that this is one of the things that\u2019s gone terribly wrong on both sides\u2026 I do. \u2026that we throw these huge \u201Cisms\u201D and these labels at each other. So the problem is, is when we\u2019re trying to make \u2014 we can\u2019t qualify every sentence. And I did a calculation once because I lost my voice. My vocal chords went paralyzed, and they said they could come back; they might not. And I counted \u2014 what was it \u2014 10 million words in the last x number of years that I have uttered. You can\u2019t utter 10 million words publically and not screw up. You\u2019re going to screw up. You\u2019re going to say things that you said poorly, you were wrong about, you regret, or were misconstrued or \u2014 it\u2019s just gonna happen. We have to start believing the best in each other instead of expecting the worst. And I\u2019m guilty. I hate to say that because I can\u2019t imagine how many people in your audience just rolled their eyes and went, you\u2019ve got to be \u2014 coming from Glenn Beck? Right. So I get that. I get that. I\u2019m the worst messenger since Paul. I get that. So, I don\u2019t mean to be the one \u2014 just please take it. Pretend I\u2019m somebody you like, and relisten to that. You can listen again and share this conversation with Glenn Beck through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, as part of our ongoing Civil Conversations Project, my guest is Glenn Beck. I\u2019ve been conversing with him privately this year about what it will take to heal the divides and misunderstanding among Americans. He is a lightning\u00A0rod of our ruptures, but for several years, he\u2019s also been acknowledging his own role in the damaged state we\u2019re in. How would you describe how you \u2014 what you do differently now editorially? You are still the same person. I do think \u2014 I would use the word \u201Crepenting.\u201D I think you have done some public repenting, but you still have very strong political convictions, which are not \u2014 which everybody is not going to agree with, and some people will disagree with violently. Sure. But can\u2019t we \u2014 hopefully not violently, but can\u2019t we \u2014 I want to get back to a place where \u2014 I mean, how is it that who we voted for is all we are? I have so much in common with \u2014 I mean, Samantha Bee is the best example. I watch Samantha Bee, and I watch her exactly as the way she probably used to watch me. I watch her with my hand over my mouth going, Sam, don\u2019t you know what this is doing to half the country? Half the country is going to hate you for this. But we\u2019ve gotten to know each other. I sincerely like her. She\u2019s really nice. We have so much in common. I really \u2014 you went on her show, and it\u2019s very, very funny. You were there both as this soul-searching person you are with me, but also as a performer, as a comedian, really. I mean, one of things she said is, \u201CIn case you haven\u2019t heard, Glenn Beck is acting really weird.\u201D This was her introduction. And she said to you, \u201CMy audience wants to kill me for normalizing a lunatic like yourself.\u201D She said to you, \u201CFor people in my world, even if all you said for the rest of your life were reasonable things, I feel like you\u2019ve still earned a permanent side-eye from them.\u201D And you kind of took that. I can understand it. I can understand it. And I hope that one day, somebody on the left can also come out, and those also on the right too \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to single out just the left \u2014 but somebody like Sam can come on my show, and I can say to her, \u201CThe things you\u2019ve said, my audience will always have a side-eye to you.\u201D And I would hope that she would say, \u201CI understand that, and I kind of deserve that, and I get it.\u201D But then, at that point, what do you do about it? So now, how do you balance comedy at this point in American history? And I hope every thinking person with a microphone or a camera is thinking about every word they say and trying to figure out, \u201CHow do I bring my audience to a better place?\u201D And it\u2019s not reasonable to ask people just \u2014 \u201CWell, then throw away your career and just stop doing that.\u201D But that\u2019s not reasonable. I have 300 employees that count on me getting up every single day. That\u2019s not reasonable. Now, how do I change? How do I make this work so I don\u2019t flush the jobs of 300 people? Yeah. I mean, let me \u2014 so let me ask you about a specific way that I think you\u2019ve had a change of heart, you had a pivot point. And this would be \u2014 this is interesting to me. After the shooting of the five police officers in Dallas, you started to shift your thinking about Black Lives Matter. This is why it was interesting, is for a lot of people who were opposed to Black Lives Matter, or just disinterested or skeptical, took that shooting of police officers in Dallas as further proof of that, right? So why did you have a different experience? We are in \u2014 I\u2019m in Dallas, Texas. That\u2019s my home. Texans do not screw around, especially when they come to our police officers. And you\u2019re right. A lot of people said, \u201CSee? Look.\u201D My staff was down covering that parade or march and \u2014 excuse me for calling it a parade \u2014 but that march. And so when the shooting happened, the people who were marching, along with my people, went behind cars and into alleyways, and they were in it together. So they went through that experience together. And they realized, in that experience \u2014 because they had a time to talk and to be there, and they talked for about an hour or two after \u2014 and they realized we\u2019re exactly the same. And so I brought those people in that were with my staff. I brought them in. I think there were five of them, ranging in age, and I said, \u201CSo let\u2019s just talk. Nothing off limits. Let\u2019s just talk.\u201D And we had a fascinating conversation. And I realized what they\u2019re saying is, \u201COur community is in trouble. Our community is in pain.\u201D Well, I understand that. I get that. And that we can unite on. You in \u2014 on The Blaze, which is your \u2014 would you say that\u2019s your primary platform now, which you founded and\u2026? Yeah. OK. So you, in 2016, at some point, said, \u201CI want to apologize for being a catastrophist,\u201D although I still \u2014 I think you still claim \u2014 do you \u2014 you claim that. I am a catastrophist. OK. You are, and you apologize for it. Oh, yeah. So in that same post, you said, \u201CWe\u2019ve got to stop scaring the kids because that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re scaring the hell out of the children.\u201D And you know, Glenn, I have to say, you\u2019re \u2014 because I\u2019ve been following your work, your show, your various shows, and your website, and your daily email, for a while \u2014 and it\u2019s such a mix, right? Because there are these healing stories and these completely \u2014 these juxtapositions and these relationships that you have. Like, you just told a story of Black Lives Matter or with Riaz Patel that are so counter to the Glenn Beck persona the Glenn Beck concept of old. But there\u2019s also a lot that is scary, I mean, that catastrophist still comes through. And I \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m just sharing. But wait. Gift of fear. Gift of fear. There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2014 and this is when \u2014 people say, \u201CWell, you sell disaster food.\u201D Yeah, you mean the same kind of food that I\u2019m reading about now in Variety about how all the Hollywood stars are stocking up with the food, building bomb shelters? Yeah, I get it. But to me, that\u2019s not part of being a catastrophist. What I\u2019m trying to do is be more of a mile marker and going, \u201CYou\u2019ve passed the last exit. You know that, right? You should stop at the nearest safe point and turn the other direction because it\u2019s going to \u2014 the things that I said were coming, many of them are happening, and we\u2019re in the direction of bad stuff. Prepare yourself now and be strong to stand against it and to be a beacon of light.\u201D Do you \u2014 I was gonna ask you how \u2014 we mentioned a while ago that you converted to the LDS church. You\u2019re a Mormon. It\u2019s an important part of your identity and your family. And I was going to ask you how your faith and your theology \u2014 I mean, I think I may just have heard it there, but \u2014 does your faith give a blessing on this, the catastrophist\u2026? Oh my gosh, no. No, I know I\u2019ve done damage to really good people of my faith. They are such good people that mind their own business and want to be left alone and just \u2014 and I\u2019ve \u2014 no. They don\u2019t like showboats. And I just feel compelled to warn people of what I see, and unfortunately, I think I\u2019ve made a lot of Christians look bad and a lot of people of faith look bad. And I will pay my price for that. When I went to Fox, that weekend I met with my family, and I said, \u201CI don\u2019t want to do this, and if I go there, this is going to change our life because it\u2019s so big, and it\u2019s just gonna \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna be good.\u201D And the family said \u2014 I said, \u201CI believe these things are coming, and I believe I have to warn people. Are we all in?\u201D And my kids, my older kids, voted on it and said yes. And I said, \u201CThen if I go, you have to do one thing. Everybody in the family has to keep a diary because I know how the world will remember me. And you need to tell the truth to my grandchildren. \u2018That\u2019s not who grandpa was.\u2019\u201D Because I knew that warning people never goes well, and then I really screwed it up on top of it. I do what I feel I\u2019m prompted to do. I take the stands that I do because I feel that I\u2019m supposed to take those stands. Unfortunately, the framing of those stands \u2014 all me. That\u2019s where it gets screwed up. The presentation of that is all Glenn. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Glenn Beck. I was aware all through last year that whoever had won in November, the presidency, what was just laid bare are these fractures, the fact that we don\u2019t know each other, these just chasms among Americans, that we don\u2019t know our fellow Americans in every direction. You sound like a catastrophist. Well, but I mean, I\u2026 Right. Right. But, so\u2026 You\u2019re worried and warning. Yes. And then I\u2019m asking, also as somebody in media, a very different kind of arm of the media, and yet, in media, and seeing the imperfections and how the old model is just not serving us all around, the way things have been always \u2014 have done. But what would you \u2014 just thinking \u2014 I always say anger is what pain and fear look like when they show themselves in public. And that\u2019s all out on the surface all around. And I\u2019m really aware of the pain and fear beneath that, and I think you are too. How are you thinking now about the work not just of telling the truth and even making the truth dramatic enough that people pay attention to the danger, but to the work of healing? Or is that just not your calling? No, I think it is. I haven\u2019t figured out how to do it exactly yet and make it \u2014 for instance, we\u2019re \u2014 I mean, I went down to the border two years ago when the border thing was really high. And my audience was so angry with me because\u2026 Well, you were handing out toys and clothing and food to undocumented immigrants on the border. Yeah. To the kids. And my audience was beside themselves for about four weeks. And I kept trying to explain there\u2019s a difference between policy and principles. We can agree on policy that, yes, they shouldn\u2019t be here. Yes, they should go home. But the principle is they\u2019re people, and they\u2019re here. So now what? We can argue about this in Washington, but we have to help people. We have to stand by and see the need in people. It was never reported, but I think we sent almost $3 million down and 18 or 19 semi trucks full of food. And that money was all raised by my audience, that once you broke down and got past and said, \u201CLook, don\u2019t make this about politics. Let\u2019s make this about who are we as people.\u201D The next thing that we did was we have rescued 6,000 \u2014 and it\u2019s probably more \u2014 probably closer to 6,500 or 7,000 refugees in Syria and Iraq. And then, right now, I\u2019m really working on a project that I helped start called \u201COur Rescue.\u201D It\u2019s an operation underground railroad. Right, working on this global slave trade. How do you present that one? I can\u2019t get anybody to look at that. My audience \u2014 I can\u2019t find a way to make that palpable or not even \u2014 safe enough for people to watch it, so they avoid it like the plague. We can change the world, but I\u2019ve got to find a way to reach into people\u2019s hearts without manipulating anything to get them to say, \u201COK, I\u2019ll look at this.\u201D And my calling now, I think, is to try to find a way back to the heart. Once the heart closes, the Bonhoeffers of the world lose. And do you feel that hearts also get opened by being outraged? Is that also that line you\u2019re walking? No, I don\u2019t think \u2014 no, I think outrage is \u2014 you\u2019re right about anger. It comes out from a place when you are afraid. And if you\u2019re afraid, your reason centers shut down. And I\u2019ve made mistakes in the last year by being too forceful with my words where I should\u2019ve said, \u201CTalk to me. You don\u2019t need to hear me. Talk to me. Tell me what you\u2019re feeling. I understand that.\u201D Because I do now. I understand what they were feeling, and I understand what the Hillary Clinton people were feeling. What, if you could\u2026 This makes me sound like a lunatic, doesn\u2019t it? No, no, it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s \u2014 no. You know what I\u2019m thinking of? I did a public conversation with Matt Kibbe, who\u2019s a libertarian\u2026 Oh, yeah. I know Matt. Yeah, and Heather McGhee who\u2019s a progressive activist. And I ended up at the end quoting \u2014 because what came to mind was \u2014 quoting Walt Whitman. And actually, I\u2019m getting it on my phone because I want to say it right. \u201CDo I contradict myself? / Very well\u2026\u201D Because \u201CI am large, I contain multitudes.\u201D And the fact is we all do. And you are just \u2014 you\u2019re being very honest. You\u2019re laying this out there, your multitudes. Can I tell you \u2014 but we are all like this. We are all like this. And we want, for some reason, we want to put everybody else into this box. I don\u2019t know why. We\u2019re all like this. And I think your critics would say that you\u2019ve done that, and I think you\u2019re confessing that. I mean, do you understand why people are confused by you? Yes. Yes, yes. And I think \u2014 and I want to be really clear. I accept responsibility for a lot of it, a lot of it. And all the big ones that I\u2019ve spent two years talking about, I take responsibility. But we all have to take responsibility as well for only listening to the clips, only listening with a hard heart. And I\u2019m not talking about me. I\u2019m talking about people on the right and the left, listening to people that don\u2019t agree with them or don\u2019t fit into that box, immediately expecting the worst. Immediately going, \u201COK, I\u2019ve heard \u2014 so I know. You also are this.\u201D No. Maybe not. Maybe they are, but maybe they\u2019re not. So let me just end by asking \u2014 I really want to believe, and I do believe that there\u2019s overlap between our audiences. I think there are. And my audience is not just a public radio audience anymore, but even so, we can get too narrow a vision of that and of your audience. But I would like for you to say \u2014 what would you like, let\u2019s say, people listening to public radio to know about your audiences as their fellow citizens that you think they don\u2019t know, this complexity that feels important to you, that we hear, that we see? I don\u2019t want to assume that I know what your audience knows or doesn\u2019t know, so. Yeah. But you know what I\u2026 I do, so\u2026 I mean, these are artificial constructs, and there\u2019s a grain of truth, and they\u2019re not the whole truth. But to that grain of truth. So what I would say if I were introducing two friends together? You guys aren\u2019t going to think you have anything in common. But all of the big things you do have in common. All of the big things, all of the \u2014 there\u2019s no one in this, within the sound of my voice that doesn\u2019t believe in the freedom of speech, in the freedom to have your private life not being snooped in, that you can live next to your neighbor and they can be different than you and they can believe different things. And you could be an atheist, and they could be a Christian, and you could be best of friends. There\u2019s nobody that I believe \u2014 that I know in my real life that is that kind of person that says, \u201CWell, I only want people like this.\u201D And I live in Texas. We\u2019re so much alike, and we\u2019re being defined, and I believe whether people know it or not, being used and manipulated and pushed into making caricatures of each other. My audience is \u2014 I really truly believe \u2014 they are open-hearted people who, for the last eight years, have been really frightened. And if you will listen to them and get past the things that you think you understand, you will recognize many of those things you\u2019re frightened of too. It\u2019s just different packaging. You\u2019ve also said \u2014 I mean, we talked about how you said, when you say the last eight years, that\u2019s the Obama presidency. You\u2019ve talked about being freaked out, and a lot of people were freaked out, and this is something that\u2019s hard for people on the other side to understand. But you\u2019ve also recently said that Obama has made you a better man. What do you mean by that? What\u2019s that? I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have the same conversation today that we had eight years ago because of the things that have happened in my life, because of the things that I\u2019ve done, both good and bad, I\u2019m a better person. I\u2019ve taken the good, as I believe the imposter that it is, and not taken that as a badge of honor. And I\u2019ve taken the bad to heart enough to go, \u201CIs that true?\u201D to be able to grow. If I could rewind the clock and keep the knowledge that I have, I\u2019d be a totally different man than I was at Fox in 2008. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I still believed the same things that I did then and I do now. I don\u2019t know how I would present it, but I wouldn\u2019t do what I did. Well, Glenn, thank you so much for this. There\u2019s nothing tied up in a neat bow here, and that is the way life is, right? It\u2019s one of those movies that \u2014 it ends, and you\u2019re like, \u201CI\u2019m not sure I like the ending.\u201D And you\u2019re like, \u201CYeah, I know, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201D Glenn Beck now broadcasts on The Blaze, a multi-platform news and entertainment network he founded. He\u2019s the author of many books of fiction and non-fiction, including The 7: Seven Wonders That Will Change Your Life."
