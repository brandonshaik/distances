  "fullText": "Today, a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer. Indiana-born and based, Carrie Newcomer has been called a \u201Cprairie mystic.\u201D She\u2019s best known for her story-songs like \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner,\u201D that get at raw and redemptive edges of human reality. She\u2019s also an interesting collaborator in writing and performance with author and educator Parker Palmer, novelist Barbara Kingsolver, and neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I welcomed Carrie Newcomer and her guitar to the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis in 2014, before a live audience. So, welcome to On Being on Loring Park. It\u2019s so wonderful to have Carrie Newcomer here. You\u2019re something of a celebrity in Quaker circles. Well, I\u2019ve never heard that before. Yeah. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s kind of a phrase that you don\u2019t usually see paired together. Right. I know, but people often, I notice that journalists often refer to you as a Quaker singer. But, I wasn\u2019t sure of this until I started to delve into this, that you weren\u2019t raised Quaker. That wasn\u2019t the religious background of your childhood. So would you talk about what that was and how you came to this tradition. Well, I was raised in Northern Indiana. I\u2019m a Hoosier, which impresses people everywhere. As much as being a Quaker celebrity? It\u2019s right up there. But my mom was raised Catholic. She\u2019s a first generation American from an Italian family. And my father was raised Methodist, but his family background was Mennonite, Amish. So I think I\u2019m the only like Italian-Amish person on the planet, I think. Except my sisters. But other than that it\u2019s just me. But I was kind of raised, in a basic Protestant-Methodist church later on. Eventually I was doing a service semester for the college I was going to in Costa Rica, and I encountered the silent \u2014 unprogrammed Quakers there in Monteverde. But it felt like home. And people will ask me often is that \u201Cyou\u2019re a musician, you make your life in sound, and you go to a silent Quaker meeting. What\u2019s with that?\u201D But it makes all the sense in the world that my best language has always come out of the silence. So, here\u2019s a sentence you wrote. \u201CMusic approaches the sacred through the wordless avenues of the heart.\u201D And I wonder, how and when in your life did you discover music and discover that music does that. I think I do sit with the silent Quakers, but I think my most consistent and deep spiritual practice has been songwriting. And when I became a teenager I fell in love with the singing poets. Those people who were \u2026 Like who? Joni Mitchell. OK. Yeah. Dylan, when I was feeling \u2026 Leonard Cohen, maybe. Leonard Cohen. All these people who were combining beautiful poetry and music. And I fell in love with that. So I picked up the guitar. But that idea of music being a spiritual practice that kind of evolved. Because to be a songwriter I had to develop and practice some of the things that I think belong to the idea of spiritual practice. I had to really start to practice presence. You have to be present. You have to show up. To whatever you\u2019re writing about? To whatever you\u2019re writing, and to your whole life. Human story. We\u2019re so amazing. People, we\u2019re interesting, and we\u2019re inspiring, and we\u2019re bewildering, there\u2019s something about that\u2026. So you know what\u2019s coming to mind when you\u2019re saying that is \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner.\u201D Ah. And it\u2019s a very wordy song, too. Yes, it is. It\u2019s not a wordless space. Lots of words. But it\u2019s really wonderful, and I think it\u2019s kind of classic Carrie Newcomer, and I\u2019m sure a lot of people here love it, too. So, would you play \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner?\u201D Oh, sure. And here\u2019s a question I have for you as a musician, especially because your lyrics are so important, and you\u2019ve written lots of songs over the years. I mean, if I asked you to play something, will you remember all the words? Do you remember all the words of every song you\u2019ve ever played over the last\u2026 Well\u2026 \u2026decades? \u2026when you have a lot of songs trailing behind you, no. Yeah. Some songs I might have to dust them off a little bit. Yeah, but not this one, probably. But, I think \u2014 yeah, I\u2019ve got \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner.\u201D \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner\u201D I think, came out of that love for people. I mean, I was traveling around and touring all over the country, and I think as a traveling folk singer, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going from arena to arena. You see the world close up. Mm-hmm. And you hear stories close up. And, so I ended up writing this little song about \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner\u201D about where community happens. And where the spirit of goodness moves in the world. Miranda works the late night counter A little joint called Betty\u2019s Diner Chrome and checkered tablecloths And one steamy windowpane She got the job that shaky fall And after hours she\u2019ll write till dawn With a nod and smile she serves them all Here we are all in one place The wants and wounds of the human race Despair and hope sit face to face When you come in from the cold Let her fill your cup with something kind Eggs and toast like bread and wine She\u2019s heard it all so she don\u2019t mind Arthur lets his Earl Grey steep Since April it\u2019s been hard to sleep You know they tried most everything But it took her in the end And Kevin tests new saxophones But he swears he\u2019s leaving quality control For the Chicago scene, or New Orleans Where they still play righteous horns Here we are all in one place The wants and wounds of the human race Despair and hope sit face to face When you come in from the cold Let her fill your cup with something kind Eggs and toast like bread and wine She\u2019s heard it all so she don\u2019t mind Jack studies here after work To get past high school he\u2019s the first His big hands look comfortable With a hammer or a pen And Emma leaned and kissed his cheek When she did his knees got weak Miranda smiles at Em and winks Here we are all in one place The wants and wounds of the human race Despair and hope sit face to face When you come in from the cold Let her fill your cup with something kind Eggs and toast like bread and wine She\u2019s heard it all so she don\u2019t mind You never know who\u2019ll be your witness You never know who grants forgiveness Look to heaven or sit with us Deidra bites her lip and frowns She works the Stop and Go downtown It happened? It happened. It\u2019s a lot of words. Deidra bites her lip and frowns She works the Stop and Go downtown She\u2019s pretty good at the crossword page And she paints her eyes blue black And Tristan comes along sometimes Small for his age and he\u2019s barely five But she loves him like a mamma lion And Veda used to drink a lot Almost lost it all before she stopped Comes in at night with her friend Mike Who runs the crisis line Michael toured Saigon and back Hair the color of smoke and ash Their heads are bowed, their hands are clasped One more storm has passed Here we are all in one place The wants and wounds of the human race Despair and hope sit face to face When you come in from the cold Let her fill your cup with something kind Eggs and toast like bread and wine She\u2019s heard it all so she don\u2019t mind Thank you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer. This phrase of yours that I love, the intimate link between creativity and spirituality, is beautiful, but it\u2019s embodied spirituality, right? That\u2019s what you do, right? It\u2019s humanity with all its mess and its edges, and as you say, it\u2019s bewilderment and beauty. Yeah, and I think I write a lot about finding something extraordinary in an ordinary day. Maybe even something sacred in an ordinary day. And I think about that a lot. And I write about it a lot. And I think there\u2019s a longing out there for that kind of acknowledgement. Mm-hmm. That our daily lives are \u2014 they\u2019re wondrous. And they\u2019re valuable. And they\u2019re honorable. The smallest things. So, I write about that a lot. Here\u2019s something else you\u2019ve said, that I\u2019d love for you to tease out for us. The source of all things is the finest and first artist. I mean, there\u2019s a piece of theology in there? You\u2019re not using the word God, which is fine, but, I mean, when we talk about God anyway, in the most traditional contexts, we use metaphor. God is Father, God is Judge. I love God as Artist or the source of all things as Artist. And that really is, as I said, it\u2019s a piece of theology. Yeah, I\u2019ve always had a spiritual current to my work. Some people come to spiritual music and creating spiritual music through the church and some of us come through the bars. It\u2019s a different way of getting there, but that idea that there is something shining in the world, there\u2019s something shimmering just below the surface of things, always. The light in the world as being an artist, as being creative, curious, ahh. But that idea of curiosity, of question, and asking questions again, and sensing that something just shimmering below the surface of things and going, wow, what is that? It seems to me this song that\u2019s the first song on your new CD, \u201CEvery Little Bit of It.\u201D Mm-hmm. There\u2019s a great line in it. I thought I knew the question, but I guess not. I really liked that, too, that finding better questions is a sacred act. Do you want to sing that one too? Sure, I could sing that. I mean, I think that song touches on a lot of the things we\u2019re talking about. Does it touch on that? I think so, yeah. I think it does. Yeah. A lot of this song \u2014 there was a section of this song that came out of conversation I was having with a mutual friend, Parker Palmer. We\u2026 Another celebrity Quaker. In fact, you two may be it. I\u2019m going to tell him you said so. No, no, I really loved and enjoyed working with Parker. And some of our conversations have become songs. I\u2019m turning on my guitar here. All right. I\u2019m going to start again. OK. It\u2019s just like your living room, too. Yeah. Just beyond my sight, Something that I cannot see, I\u2019ve been circling round a thought, That\u2019s been circling round me. Like the vapor of a song, That is just out of earshot, I thought I knew the question, But I guess not. There it is just below the surface of things, In a flash of blue, and the turning of wings. I drain the glass, drink it down, every moment of this, Every little bit of it, every little bit. I swam against the tide, I tripped on my own pride, So I\u2019ll try again today, To get out of my own way. The face was always in the stone, Said Michelangelo, You just have to chip and clear, To see what is already there. There it is, just below, the surface of things, In a flash of blue, and the turning of wings. I drain the glass, drink it down, every moment of this, Every little bit of it, every little bit. There it is in the apple of every new notion, There it is in the scar healed over what was broken, In the branches, in the whispering, in the silence and the sighs, And the curious promise of limited time. It\u2019s true although it\u2019s hard, A shadow glides over the ridge. And one fast beating heart, Tries with all its might to live. And we sense but can\u2019t describe, From the corner of our eyes Something nameless and abiding, And so we keep transcribing. There it is just below the surface of things, In a flash of blue, and the turning of wings. I drain the glass, drink it down, every moment of this, Every little bit of it, every little bit. Every little bit of this Every little bit Every little bit of it Every little bit of it. Thank you. I\u2019m curious if you remember the conversation you had with Parker that turned into that song. Well, it was actually a series of conversations. We were talking about the thing that shines below the surface of everything. The curious promise of limited time. Yes. That\u2019s a wonderful line. Thank you. An idea that we\u2019re here, we\u2019re here right now in this moment, and when you know that time is limited, it makes everything a little more poignant. A little more powerful. I wonder if \u2014 the word \u201Clight\u201D is a word you use a lot. I wonder if you know that. Mm-hmm. I mean, it\u2019s not that\u2026 I do. \u2026a lot of people use it. It\u2019s a very important metaphor and image and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re the only one who uses it. But it really did jump out at me. The geography of light is\u2026 Yeah. \u2026very evocative. You had an album which you named\u2026 The Geography of Light. \u2026Geography of Light. Well, I\u2019m just wondering if you can put words around what it is about light that keeps calling you? Well, I\u2019ve always liked in the Quaker tradition that sometimes God is referred to, or whatever the larger is, is referred to as the light, And we all experience that \u2014 that which happens when you see a sunset and your heart becomes too big for your chest? Or the first time you see your baby in your arms and time expands out in all directions from that child? When you see that first red leaf of autumn and it\u2019s bittersweet. And it\u2019s so incredibly exciting at the same time. What is that? So I see it, and I sense it every day. I see it in people all the time. And maybe that\u2019s why I keep writing about it. Because I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is. Yeah, well \u2026 I just know it\u2019s there. Yes, and I think the autumn analogy also gets at something I sense behind it is also a presence to darkness, right? Being attentive to light because you\u2019re attentive to the shadows. Yeah, it\u2019s all shadow and light. There\u2019s a lot of sorrows in this world. And, maybe that\u2019s part of how I negotiate that. I think when you\u2019re sensitive to the sorrows of this world and you\u2019ve experienced shadows in your own life that you can do different things with it. You can despair. You can shut down. Or you can lean into the light. Without denying or placing in a compartment or making small this idea of shadow, it\u2019s just there. It\u2019s life. It\u2019s all of it. It\u2019s all of the above. Yeah, that is a very redemptive way of thinking about. The song that occurs to me is \u201CBare to the Bone.\u201D And to me that\u2019s about, yes, I mean, it\u2019s struggling with something like depression, which I have gone through, or these really bad things that happen to us, but also I think that song is about how kind of day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year, struggle is also kind of woven into the things that are right. Yes. Right? It just is. And, there\u2019s something about leaning into that, too, which is hard. Yeah, there\u2019s some songs that land \u2014 there are songs that you hone on for a long time. \u201CBetty\u2019s Diner\u201D was a project. It was notes taken on the road. It was a short story. Right. Now it\u2019s a play, actually. I\u2019ve written a play\u2026 It is? \u2026with Richard Thomas and it\u2019ll be produced at Purdue University in 2015. But, yeah, some things you hone on for a long time. Mm-hmm. And then once in every great while, a song comes all \u2014 it\u2019s already done. It\u2019s completed. You just kind of get out of the way. And \u201CBare to the Bone\u201D was like that. I sat down in my space where I like to write, and it came out in half an hour. Really? Yeah. Would you sing that one? Sure. I wish there were more of those. But it\u2019s only once in a great while, but that idea of struggle being part of it. It\u2019s a simple song, really. Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s interesting. \u2026kind of. Musically. I think something also good happened to my music when I stopped being afraid to do something \u2014 to present it simply, because I was afraid that people would think I couldn\u2019t do it in a complex way. There\u2019s a simplicity that happens when you just don\u2019t know what else to do. And it can be a little raw. And it can be real honest. And then there\u2019s the simplicity that happens because it\u2019s the best way to say it. So\u2026 Here I am without a message Here I stand with empty hands Just a spirit tired of wandering Like a stranger in this land Walking wide eyed through this world Is the only way I\u2019ve known Wrapped in hope and good intentions Bare to the bone There is nothing I won\u2019t show you Nothing I can hide I\u2019ve risked it all and dreamt it all And seldom questioned why You took me in when I was hungry When my spirit ached and groaned Laid wide open and defenseless And bare to the bone So, when I rise, I rise in glory If I do, I do by grace Time will wash away these footprints And we\u2019ll leave without a trace Between here and now and forever Is such precious little time What we do in love and kindness Is all we ever leave behind. When the light is slowly fading And my eyes is softly waning And the evening sun is setting\u2026 You can listen again and share this conversation with Carrie Newcomer through our website, onbeing.org. \u2026and the world is barely breathing Then your voice can call me And your hands can lead me home Like a newborn awed and naked And bare to the bone. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. So, when I rise, I rise in glory If I do, I do by grace Time will wash away these footprints And we\u2019ll leave without a trace Between here and now and forever Is such precious little time What we do in love and kindness Is what we really leave behind I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a live musical conversation at On Being on Loring Park, with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer. Here I am without a message Here I stand with empty hands Just a spirit tired of wandering Like a stranger in this land Walking wide eyed through this world Is the only way I\u2019ve known Wrapped in hope and good intentions Bare to the bone Wrapped in hope and good intentions Bare to the bone So, some journalist from Boston called you a prairie mystic. I\u2019ve been around a lot of people lately who have been using the word \u201Cprophet,\u201D and I love the \u2014 not just the language of a mystic, but the idea. But you use the word \u201Cmystic\u201D when you write about people. You know, somebody\u2019s who\u2019s a carpenter, a mystic, and a poet. And I wonder, if you\u2019d say a little bit about how you think about mystics among us, or who the mystics are among us. What are the qualities of that? The piece, I think, that you were quoting from was about a fellow in my Quaker meeting, who has recently passed away in his \u201990s. And he was just one of these incredible people that just could not get the world close enough. He just was this incredible character. And he would talk about the natural world in ways that really honored that shining something that was present in it. And I felt he was a mystic. He would never say that. Yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 Of course not. \u2026that\u2019s proof\u2026 Part of the deal. \u2026that it might be true. There\u2019s this \u2014 an analogy that somebody offered me, and it was the earliest days of the show, but I\u2019ve never forgotten it. It was a scientist, a geneticist, who\u2019s also an Anglican priest. He said that the spirituality of a scientist is like the spirituality of a mystic, which is to say, defining and asserting truth as best as you can articulate it in this moment, but always living in the expectation \u2014 always taking delight in what you do not yet, cannot yet, know, and living in the expectation of better discoveries to come. Yeah, that idea of living in the expectation, to live in the question. Mm-hmm. And, to be comfortable there, to live in the question. Yeah. And in the wonder of it, the wonder of the question. I think, though, sometimes, living in the wonder can be a creative tension, but in a tension with the certainties. And I think that was his point, that that is actually a holy tension, a sacred tension. I think it is. Though something happens \u2014 I have a song called \u201CI Believe\u201D that came about because I was asked to sing in a church service, and this particular church service at one point, the people stood and they recited a creed together as a community. They weren\u2019t Quakers? They weren\u2019t Quakers, because they kind of don\u2019t say anything, so\u2026 Yeah. But I got to thinking about it, that there is something powerful, not when it\u2019s said without thought, but when you do say something out loud that\u2019s important to you, I love you, and you mean it. Or, if you need me I will be there. When you say it out loud, this I love, something shifts, something changes a little bit. So there is that thing of what is it, I believe? What is it that I think is true, at least now, as close as I can find and articulate? Yeah, I think there\u2019s something\u2026 And I wonder. \u2026deeply human and essential about that. Yeah. Even for the most deeply constantly questioning of us. The edges can get soft. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there\u2019s no place to put your feet. There\u2019s something that you wrote \u2014 this is in your book, and I may just read a little bit of this, and maybe ask you to read the rest of it. Or then you read it yourself, but I want to read it just because I love these words. \u201CThree Gratitudes.\u201D Now, and it\u2019s a wonderful poem, but I also just find this idea so useful. I want to start doing this myself. And here\u2019s how it starts: \u201CEvery night before I go to sleep I say out loud three things that I am grateful for, all the significant, insignificant, extraordinary, ordinary stuff of my life. It\u2019s a small practice and humble, and yet, I find I sleep better holding what lightens and softens my heart.\u201D And it\u2019s true. It was like this saying out loud three things. Sometimes they would be big things, and sometimes they would be little things. And then sometimes I\u2019d get on a roll and I just couldn\u2019t stop. And you do it even on the days that were hard? Yes, I would. And that would change something. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s some really interesting science now about \u2014 and it\u2019s not that different from this. I mean, it\u2019s just about asking people and the \u2014 in a study to, once a week or once a day make a list of things they\u2019re grateful for, very routine. Mm-hmm. And it improves their health, and, yeah, they sleep better, they\u2019re more at peace. Kindness is another idea like that. I think we talk about love a lot, and I think love can get really big. Love gets like, you can\u2019t almost get your arms around it, it\u2019s such a big thing, but kindness. Kindness is like the country cousin to love. It just kind of does dishes, when no one asked it to. You know what I mean? And I try in some ways that the songs that I write would have a bit of that feeling to them that just, a sense of kindness about them, as to hope, anyways. Hmm. You want to read that poem? Sure. The whole thing, the \u201CThree Gratitudes\u201D. \u201CThree Gratitudes\u201D, this is related to a song called \u201CThank You and Good Night.\u201D Every night before I go to sleep I say out loud Three things that I\u2019m grateful for, All the significant, insignificant Extraordinary, ordinary stuff of my life. It\u2019s a small practice and humble, And yet, I find I sleep better Holding what lightens and softens my life Ever so briefly at the end of the day. Sunlight, and blueberries, Good dogs and wool socks, A fine rain, A good friend, Fresh basil and wild phlox, My father\u2019s good health, My daughter\u2019s new job, The song that always makes me cry, Always at the same part, No matter how many times I hear it. Decent coffee at the airport, And your quiet breathing, The stories you told me, The frost patterns on the windows, English horns and banjos, Wood Thrush and June bugs, The smooth glassy calm of the morning pond, An old coat, A new poem, My library card, And that my car keeps running Despite all the miles. And after three things, More often than not, I get on a roll and I just keep on going, I keep naming and listing, Until I lie grinning, Blankets pulled up to my chin, Awash with wonder At the sweetness of it all. You wrote \u2014 or said, \u201CMy best prayers are songs, always have been.\u201D Yeah. And I wondered if you might sing us a song that is a prayer. Well, they\u2019re all kind of. Mm-hmm. They\u2019re all kind of like that. Yeah, OK. Well, what feels more like the prayer you would pray today? So this is on the new one. And it\u2019s kind of about hope in a way, and thresholds, and there\u2019s a lot on this new album about thresholds. We\u2019re always coming up to new thresholds. That\u2019s such a great word, too. I love that word. Thresholds. I do, too. Yeah. And we keep arriving at them and, at a threshold there\u2019s often a moment where what is old has passed away, but the new hasn\u2019t quite arrived yet. So you stand there at the doorway. And all the more important that we remember to be kind. Yeah. \u2018Cause we\u2019re all kind of figuring it out right now. Yeah. But yeah, that idea \u2014 and I think you\u2019re \u2014 I really sense that everywhere I go, too I think there is this longing out there \u2014 that longing. And sometimes, not even sure what exactly the longing\u2019s about just yet. Looking out at the night Beyond the driver\u2019s wheel, Curving hips made of snow In the winter fields. There\u2019s a house set way back Where the lamplight glows, Like a star out in the cold, Filled with people I\u2019ll never know, Who left a light, Left a light in the window. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer. What would I change if The choice were mine? I was doing the best I knew at the time. And every door that was opened And door that closed, All the things that made me grow, Sent me off down another road, Off to look for a light, For a light in the window. Now the old has already passed away But the new is too new to be born today. So I\u2019m throwing out seeds On the winter snow, As a cold wind begins to blow, Standing here on a new threshold, I can see a light, There\u2019s a light in the window. And the world is made of stone, And the world is made of glass. And the world is made of light, And it\u2019s moving very fast. We pass from mystery to mystery So I won\u2019t lie I don\u2019t know what happens When people die. But I hope that I see you walking slow, Smiling wide as a sunrise grows, Drop my map with a thousand folds, In the distance I see it glow, There\u2019s a light, there\u2019s a light There\u2019s a light in the window There\u2019s that light again. There it is again. It does fascinate me. Yeah. So, this one, actually, I listened to this great interview that you did with Vincent Harding. Oh, yeah, who just died this year. Yeah, and, what a beautiful interview that was. Yeah. I mean, just talking about people singing together. Yes. The importance of people singing together. How in the \u201960s, how the Civil Rights Movement sang their way to freedom. I was very touched by it. And he kind of challenged, though, a little bit at the end. We need those \u2014 we need more. We need the new ones that people are writing today. And I thought, yeah, well, I\u2019m a songwriter. Yeah, no, and I want to ask you about that, I talked to the Indigo Girls last summer. Mm-hmm. And Amy Ray in particular, she\u2019s very oriented towards social justice. And I asked them, and this was on my list of questions we didn\u2019t get to. She said, this is something I\u2019m thinking about. And I think songwriters are thinking about \u2014 where\u2019s the Pete Seeger? And music was so central\u2026 Yes. \u2026to all of that ferment a few decades ago. Yes, and it\u2019s an interesting, it\u2019s really an art form. It\u2019s a challenge to write a song, a song that people can sing immediately the first time they hear it. Well, and the other thing that they got people doing, and the spirituals, of course, did this, right? Yes. Which is what\u2026 The call and response. \u2026the Civil Rights \u2014 yeah. Yes. But something happens, the room shifts when people sing together. And they sing out loud things, words and phrases, that touch something deep and human and hopeful. And I wanted to write a song that talked about hope, but not in a greeting card kind of way. There\u2019s the kind of hope that\u2019s like wishful thinking. And then there\u2019s like a hope that\u2019s kind of gritty. It\u2019s like, the kind of hope that gets up every morning and chooses to try to make the world just a little kinder place in your own way. And the next morning gets up, and does it again. And the next morning, gets up, and you have been disappointed. And you do it again. I wanted to write about the kind of hope that\u2019s faithful, that kind that Niebuhr talked about: \u201Canything worth doing will probably not be achieved in one lifetime. So we are saved by hope.\u201D That kind of hope. And that\u2019s a harder kind of hope to live with, because it\u2019s easier to be cynical. I mean, when you\u2019re cynical, you\u2019re never disappointed. Right. That\u2019s true. It\u2019s like, well, I knew that. It\u2019s cowardly in that sense, isn\u2019t it? Well, it\u2019s courageous to hope, because when you do choose to hope, eventually at some point your heart will be broken, and you will be disappointed. And then you get up and you do it again. But I think courage has nothing to do with being fearless. I think courage has everything to do with loving something or someone so much that you will brave it with solid feet or shaky knees because you love it that much. And music has always been like that for me, And, the things we hope for. The things we love. We hope, because we love it that much. It\u2019s worth the risk.We do have an audience here, so, you could sing along. You\u2019ve been hoping, right? Well, we just figure out when to sing along? Well, this is the part.
