  "fullText": "I was hooked by the first line of Beyond Revenge \u2014 a book by the research psychologist Michael McCullough. What he\u2019s learning, he said, is \u201Cfor people who want to bypass all of the pious-sounding statements about the power of forgiveness, and all of the fruitless sermonizing about the destructiveness of revenge.\u201D Both revenge and forgiveness, he says, have their purpose in human biology and history. But from neighborhood arguments to civil wars, Michael McCullough\u2019s science is showing how we can make forgiveness more possible and appealing. Some of the baggage is that it\u2019s a namby-pamby thing that doormats do, but from everything I\u2019ve manage to read and see and understand, forgiveness is a brawny muscular exercise that I kind of imagine someone with a great passion for life and a great hardy sort of disposition being able to take on. \u201CGetting Revenge and Forgiveness.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. Michael McCullough directs the Evolution and Human Behavior Laboratory at the University of Miami. He works with social scientific research as well as emerging discoveries in biology and brain chemistry. His focus on the biology of revenge and forgiveness has taken him into other related areas of human moral sentiments, gratitude, and self-control. I interviewed Michael McCullough in 2008, just after he had published Beyond Revenge. I think one of the important themes that comes through that I just, you know, that I think is important for us to talk about, to lay the ground work for what you have to say, what you are learning is that we lay people, citizens, consumers of science and journalism have to open our imaginations to think in new ways about subjects like revenge and forgiveness. That there are certain boxes in to which we\u2019ve put these things. That\u2019s right. One of the things that got me writing Beyond Revenge actually was the dissatisfaction with the kind of boxes that we all tend to put \u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026 revenge and forgiveness in as human dispositions. So if you turn on the news, you see certainly senseless acts of revenge. But we don\u2019t really know what to do with those once we see those acts. What are the stories we tell ourselves about what causes those acts? What kind of judgments do we pass about the people who commit them? Do we demonize them? Do we call them animals? Those I think do tend to be the kind of conclusions we draw. And the more I read and the more I tried to dig deeply into not just the social sciences but also the biological sciences, as you say, the worse that story really seemed to fit, um \u2026 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. \u2026 as it seems to me revenge is much more deeply etched into the human mind than \u2014 than those kind of stories would suggest. Right. I want to try to understand this, because you really talk about two different kind of preconceptions \u2014 or I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re different or if they converge and I just don\u2019t get it. On the one hand, there\u2019s this idea, you know, that human nature really is brutish and that positive characteristics like generosity and love and forgiveness are exceptions to human nature. And then on the other hand, there is the disease model of revenge, which is more compatible with the way religious traditions tend to think about revenge \u2014 in the modern era, at least \u2014 and kind of the therapeutic model. Now do those ways of thinking come together or do they both \u2014 do they form us at the same time? Yeah. Here\u2019s what I think we are up against. OK. If you go back to the Greek tragedies, what you see the Greeks grappling with is why revenge is so disruptive to their efforts to establish social order. Mm-hmm. You see and you know, you have \u2014 you have these amazing stories, right? Medea, she\u2019s so angry at her husband for his unfaithfulness to her that she destroys her own children, right, as a way of trying to get back at him. And so it goes on and on throughout these great works of Western literature. Mm-hmm. I think what we tend to think from these images, which of course trickle in to, you know, more popular media, movies and novels. Right. Lord of the Flies, Westside Story, are some of the ones you mention these \u2026 Of course. Yeah. Mad Max, um, let\u2019s see, Death Wish, you know \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 and on and on and on. Is that revenge is a curse or a disease or some kind of poison that gets into minds and, um, sort of takes control of them and then wrecks individuals and wrecks societies and wrecks families. Then that affects how you think about what forgiveness is as well. Right. And so, I think the thing that we tend to assume about forgiveness is that it\u2019s a cure, right? Mm-hmm. That someone came along \u2014 some \u2014 some Einstein of the moral realm, some wonderfully wise person in history, and discovered how powerful forgiveness could be as an antidote to this toxin or this poison. Right. And so we\u2019re left really, I think, now, thinking about revenge and forgiveness as \u2014 in the case of revenge, something gone wrong in humanity and forgiveness being the thing we have to learn to do because we don\u2019t know how to do it naturally. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean, so, one of the things you seem to be about is reclaiming the normalcy of both revenge and, uh, forgiveness as a part of human nature. I mean, I\u2019d like to talk about revenge first, if we could, and why revenge is in us and what purpose it has served even in evolutionary terms. One study that really got my attention was a study on chimpanzees, which showed that if a chimpanzee is harmed by an individual that it\u2019s living with, it has the ability to remember who that individual is and target aggression back at that individual in the 10 minutes, 20 minutes, hour later. And for most people, and certainly for me when I started working on this, I was surprised to know that chimpanzees had these kinds of mental abilities, right? I had to learn more. I wanted to know where else do you see this in the animal kingdom. You see it in other kinds of primates, such as one type of monkey that I like a lot, a monkey called the Japanese macaque. OK. And Japanese macaques are very status-conscious individuals. They\u2019re very intimidated by power; let\u2019s just put it that way. OK. They\u2019re very intimidated by power. So if you\u2019re a high-ranking Japanese macaque and you harm a low-ranking Japanese macaque, that low-ranking individual is not going to harm you back, right? It\u2019s just too intimidating. It\u2019s too anxiety provoking. But what they do instead, and this still astonishes me, is they will find a relative of that high-ranking individual and go seek that low-ranking cousin out or nephew and harm him in retaliation. Really? Yeah. So it\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying, \u201CYou know, I\u2019m not powerful enough to get you back, but what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to go harm your nephew.\u201D Now that does sound like human behavior, doesn\u2019t it? Right. And here\u2019s the kicker, is when they\u2019re harming this nephew, most of the time they\u2019re doing it while the high-ranking individual is watching. They want the high-ranking individual to know that, you know, you can harm me. I know you can harm me. I know you\u2019re more powerful than I am. But rest assured, I know how to get at what you care about and what you value. You know, I had this realization a few years ago when we did a program on the death penalty. It might seem simple but it seems so stunning to me to realize that the criminal justice system, and even, and especially, the death penalty in history, was progress because before there was any kind of criminal justice system, human societies regulated themselves by precisely that kind of revenge you\u2019re describing. Throughout most of human history we have not lived in complex societies with governments and states and law enforcement and prisons \u2026 Right. \u2026 and contracts that we could enforce in a court to get people to do what they agreed to do. So the mechanism that individuals relied upon to protect themselves and to protect their loved ones and to protect their property was fear of retaliation. And if they could broadcast that fear of retaliation to the individuals they lived with, to their neighbors, to the people on the other side of the hill, and you could cultivate a reputation as a hothead so people knew not to mess with you, that was like an insurance policy. And you\u2019re absolutely right that in a lot of the world this is still going on. Right. And any time you disrupt that system, that system of government, that system of policing, that system of law enforcement, so people can\u2019t trust that their interests are going to be protected, that desire for revenge comes back. And people will take revenge back into their own hands to protect themselves. And I think you\u2019re also saying in your research that \u2014 and also in terms of what we know about the brain \u2014 that the emotions, the reactions, that arise in response to grievance \u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026 are also \u2014 we are hard-wired to have those reactions, that they serve a purpose. I mean, I remember Sister Helen Prejean saying to me when we did that work on the death penalty, you know, she\u2019s a great opponent of the death penalty, but she said, \u201CAnger is a moral response,\u201D you know? That\u2019s right. It certainly is. Anger in response to injustice is as reliable a human emotional response as happiness is to winning the lottery, or grief is to losing a loved one. Mm-hmm. And if you look at the brain of somebody who has just been harmed by someone, right, they\u2019ve been ridiculed or harassed or insulted \u2014 we can put those people into technology that allows us to see what their brains are doing, right? So we can look at sort of what your brain looks like on revenge. It looks exactly like the brain of somebody who is thirsty and is just about to get a sweet drink to drink or somebody who\u2019s hungry who\u2019s about to get a piece of chocolate to eat. It\u2019s like the satisfaction of a craving? It is exactly like that. It is literally a craving. What you see is high activation in the brain\u2019s reward system. So, the desire for revenge does not come from some sick, dark part of how our minds operate. It is a craving to solve a problem and accomplish a goal. And then I guess what is especially intriguing about your work as well, and perhaps even more surprising, even kind of takes us out of our boxes, than the fact that revenge is natural is that you are really suggesting also from a scientific perspective that we have a forgiveness instinct, an aptitude for forgiveness, and that has been crafted by natural selection just like revenge. I expected to find, frankly, less research as I dug through hundreds of scientific articles on the naturalness of forgiveness. But, boy, was I wrong. As it turns out, a lot of biologists have been trying to figure out what allows human beings to be the cooperative creatures that we are. We\u2019re cooperative with each other in a way that really makes us pretty unique among mammals, for sure. You know, we cooperate with our relatives, but lots of animals do that. But we go further and we cooperate with people we\u2019ve never met. We cooperate with people that we\u2019re not related to. And by virtue of our abilities to cooperate with each other, we can build magnificent cities and radio stations and do all kinds of wonderful things. But one of the ingredients you have to have to get individuals to cooperate with each other is a tolerance for mistakes, OK? Hmm. Interesting. You can\u2019t get organisms that are willing to hang in there with each other through thick and thin and make good things happen despite the roadblocks and the bumps along the way if they aren\u2019t willing to tolerate each other\u2019s mistakes. Sometimes, if we\u2019re cooperatively hunting \u2014 let\u2019s say we\u2019re some sort of animal that works together to hunt \u2014 sometimes, I\u2019m going to let you down. And maybe it\u2019s not even intentional, but I\u2019m going to get distracted and I\u2019m going to make a mistake. And if you take each of those mistakes as the last word about my cooperative disposition, you might just give up and so no cooperation gets done. So, really, our ability \u2014 and across the animal kingdom many animals\u2019 ability to cooperate with each other and make things happen that they can\u2019t do on their own \u2014 is undergirded by an ability to forgive each other for occasional defections and mistakes. Here\u2019s a passage from your book, which, again, a lot of this just seems so basic, doesn\u2019t it, when you articulate it, but it\u2019s things we don\u2019t see or think about. I mean, you know, you said that everyday acts of forgiveness are incredibly common among people who know each other. Right. You know, we think of forgiveness as these heroic acts and there are always these heroic examples of forgiveness. But you said we think of it as this balm for great wounds. But you said: \u201CYet, in daily life, forgiveness is more often like a Band-Aid on a scrape and at first glance perhaps only slightly more interesting. But, of course, uninteresting doesn\u2019t mean unimportant.\u201D Right. And this, again, was part of my attempt to do violence, I guess, to this metaphor of forgiveness as this difficult thing that we have to consciously practice and learn, because we don\u2019t know how to do it on their own. I forgive my seven-year-old son every day, right? Right. Because he\u2019s an active, inquisitive seven-year-old who sometimes accidentally elbows me in the mouth when we\u2019re cuddling and sometimes puts Crayons on the walls. And yet it seems demeaning to call it forgiveness. To even call it forgiveness. Right. Right. I wouldn\u2019t dignify it with the term forgiveness. It\u2019s just what you do with your children. You know, you \u2014 you accept their limitations and you move on. He broke my tooth once when I was drinking out of a water glass. Right. Right. I mean, parents have a million of these stories, right? Right. But you don\u2019t put any effort into forgiving. It naturally happens and you move on. And there\u2019s a great evolutionary story about why it comes so easy in those kinds of circumstances too. Mm-hmm, which is pretty obvious, I guess. Yeah. I mean, evolution wasn\u2019t kind to individuals who would seek revenge against their genetic relatives, bottom line, right? So we have this natural tolerance for the misbehavior of our children. So it is at that level you\u2019re talking about incredibly mundane. We put no effort into it. It happens every day a thousand times. We would never even give it a second thought. And yet we do it over and over again. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CGetting Revenge and Forgiveness.\u201D One figure of public forgiveness whom Michael McCullough writes about is Bud Welch. His 23-year-old daughter Julie died in the bombing of the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Here\u2019s a statement Bud Welch made prior to the 2001 execution of Timothy McVeigh, the man responsible for that bombing. The first month after the bombing, I didn\u2019t even want Tim McVeigh or Terry Nichols to even have trials. I simply wanted them fried. And then I finally come to realize that the reason that Julie and 167 others were dead is because of vengeance and rage. And when we take him out of his cage to kill him, it\u2019s going to be the same thing. We will keep the circle of violence going. Number 169 dead is not going to help the family members of the first 168. You do talk about some amazing examples of forgiveness, of public forgiveness, one of them being Bud Welch. But I sometimes think that those kinds of examples that do make the news, like the bombing, also exalt forgiveness as something that\u2019s really beyond the reach of most of us most of the time. You know, we kind of wish \u2014 we hope that we would be that gracious, perhaps, but it almost feels, um, superhuman. Right. And if you look at Bud Welch and you look at that story from the outside and you ask yourself how can this man whose daughter was killed in this terrible explosion ever get over his rage, from the outside we have a really hard time imagining that. But if you look at the story of Bud Welch, actually what you find is he had a lot of help along the way. And if you look at the story very carefully, you can actually learn a lot about how the human mind evolved to forgive and what kind of conditions activate that instinct in human minds, because a lot of those conditions ended up falling into place for Bud. In fact, he doesn\u2019t talk about forgiveness even for himself in that case as having been some massive struggle. Well, it was incremental, also, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, it gets reported as an act, but in fact it was a process. Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s right. And along the way, there were events that he actually made happen for himself that turned forgiveness into one of these things that can be easier. For example, he actually sought out Timothy McVeigh\u2019s father and visited him one day at the McVeigh home and had this moment he describes when he saw Timothy\u2019s picture on the mantel. Mm-hmm. It was a high school graduation picture. And they were just making small talk and Bud said to McVeigh\u2019s father, he said, \u201CGod, that\u2019s a good-looking kid.\u201D And the tears just began pouring out of the elder McVeigh. And what he realized then was that here was another father on the verge of losing a son, of losing a child. And that immediate experience of sympathy and compassion went a tremendous way in facilitating the forgiveness process for Bud. So right off the bat, this real human interaction starts to turn forgiveness from something difficult to do to something that\u2019s easier to do because this compassion has happened naturally in the course of real human interaction and then suddenly forgiveness is a little easier. So this is getting to one of the really important points I think you make with your work, that if we can understand this forgiveness instinct and how, that even understanding it in terms of evolution, that we can start to create conditions where it can be empowered. Right. The first is safety. Human beings are naturally prone to forgive individuals that they feel safe around. So if we have an offender that is apologizing in a way that seems heartfelt and convincing and has really convinced us that they can\u2019t and won\u2019t harm us in the same way again, OK, that\u2019s a point on the forgiveness side. The human mind evolved for forgiveness to be something worth its while, and any successful organism is unlikely to have a mechanism in it that says, you know, \u201CJust keep stepping on my neck. It\u2019s OK.\u201D Right. Right. Right. Right. \u201CBut if you can convince me that you\u2019re safe, right, that I don\u2019t have to worry about being harmed in the same way a second time, maybe I\u2019m willing to move a little bit forward.\u201D But it seems like that would be the hardest, um, condition or assumption to put in place in the context of many of the worst cycles of revenge in our world. Sometimes safety comes through things like the rule of law, right? Mm-hmm. Sometimes safety comes through you as a small-business owner dusting off that employee manual that you don\u2019t think about anymore and asking yourself what is in here that would instruct an employee on what to do if they were being systematically harassed by a co-worker and that if there was a real serious infraction it would be dealt with in a way that restored that employee\u2019s sense of safety, right? Mm-hmm. What can you do in your associations when somebody has a grievance, that when the neighbor has a band that he\u2019s hired for a party playing at 12:30 on a Friday night, that you know how to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen a second time, right? So that you don\u2019t then have to say, \u201CWell, I\u2019m going to get back at that guy myself.\u201D Right. \u201CI\u2019m going to leave my garbage cans out all weekend long, which I know he hates,\u201D right? You\u2019re talking about revenge in ordinary life, which is where I think we\u2019re more comfortable talking about it in terms of warring tribes across the globe. Well, I can take it in any \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 the thing I like about these principles is they\u2019re scalable, right? Actually, usually people when \u2014 when people ask me about the book, they\u2019re actually less interested in the geopolitical stuff. OK. But I can, you know \u2026 OK. Well, yeah, we\u2019ll get there. So what\u2019s the second after safety? Value. We are inclined to forgive individuals who are likely to have benefit for us in the future. So we find it really easy, as I was saying, to forgive our loved ones or forgive our friends or forgive our neighbors or our business partners because there\u2019s something in it for us in the future, right? Mm-hmm. And the costs sometimes of destroying a relationship that\u2019s been damaged are just too high because establishing a new one is so difficult to do. So relationships that have value in them are ones in which we\u2019re naturally prone to forgive. We had some fun when we first created this show a few years ago \u2014 we asked listeners to share their favorite songs about revenge and forgiveness. As far as we can tell, revenge seems to make for better music. Listen to the \u201CSongs of Revenge\u201D playlist we compiled with tracks from Johnny Cash, Justin Timberlake, Ani DiFranco, and the Rolling Stones. That\u2019s at onbeing.org. While you\u2019re there, you can also download my complete, unedited conversation with Michael McCulloch. Again, onbeing.org. Coming up, how the psychology and biology of forgiveness can apply to a noisy neighbor, or to Joseph Kony in Uganda. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CGetting Revenge and Forgiveness.\u201D Michael McCullough directs the Evolution and Human Behavior Laboratory at the University of Miami. He understands both forgiveness and revenge as part of the birthright of the human species. And he\u2019s learning how we can calm or trigger either impulse. I interviewed Michael McCullough in 2008 \u2014 as it happens, in the midst of the last presidential election season. Let\u2019s talk about this in terms of concrete challenges, and we\u2019re in an election year. I wonder as you watch that, and you\u2019re in the South, um, you\u2019re in a politically charged state, how do some of these things you think about in terms of forgiveness, what runs through your mind when you think about how we might come to any kind of resolution about any of these difficult, divisive issues? Uh, well, we do have a hard time seeing things from other people\u2019s perspectives , and we tend to view other people who have positions different from ours as having much more similarity to each other than we do. We can see the great variety in our own positions. Oh, but we can\u2019t see the variety in other people\u2019s positions. No, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s interesting. Yeah. We tend to paint them with the same brush. And so we tend to really simplify positions that other groups have or people on other sides of positions. So we have a simplified view. We tend to actually view them as more partisan and more extreme on average than the average really seems to be. And so there\u2019s something about how the mind works and how it processes groups, right, when we think about people from over there, that other group \u2026 Right. \u2026 that kind of causes us to not really view them with the same sort of humanity that we afford our own groups. You know, you think about an issue that you feel strongly about and that you know a lot about and you can say, \u201CWell, actually, there are a lot of people who have sort of different views than mine. They\u2019re not exactly the same,\u201D and that allows you to view them as human beings, right? Right. Um, harder to do something about the limitations of the mind. Or perhaps because of how the mind was actually designed to work, we have a harder time affording that kind of benefit of the doubt to other groups. So if we know that, then \u2026 If we know that about ourselves, right, you\u2019re saying if we can get an awareness about that, perhaps that is a beginning. Then you can begin to say, \u201CWell, they\u2019re just a group of human beings, too, trying to muddle their way through a position that\u2019s going to work for them.\u201D And maybe that kind of recognition of their diversity as well can help. Then maybe we\u2019ll have less anxiety about interacting in a civil way. You know, I mean, just to kind of go to the geopolitical level, you tell some stories about, let\u2019s say, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, uh, where you have, you know, cycles, generations of grievance and revenge kind of layered on top of each other. And yet, you tell stories and we\u2019ve all heard these kinds of stories and I\u2019ve met some of these people who are, you know, amazing, who have still moved beyond that in themselves, have reached out to people on the other side, have formed just what you said, have come to see the other group as human and have formed friendship. And those kinds of stories don\u2019t tend to be in the headlines. We hear the headlines of continued violence and continued animosity, right? Right. But from the studies you\u2019ve seen or from what you know about how these things play themselves out in different societies, we know \u2014 what does it take? Is it possible even, say, in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis that one day those networks reach such a critical mass that the balance is shifted? I mean, does it work that way? Um, how does that kind of collective change really happen? Some of it happens when people become too tired to fight, right? Or too \u2026 Yeah. You tell that story in northern Uganda. Yeah. Right? You said there\u2019s an epidemic of forgiveness that\u2019s grown out of fatigue as much as anything else. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Sometimes the costs of maintaining grievances are so high that individuals and their groups will decide that they\u2019ve pushed themselves to the brink. They\u2019ve demonstrated their insistence on defending themselves, and they\u2019ve shown that they will defend themselves to the end. And, having done that, it becomes possible to try to find a new way. Would you tell the story of what\u2019s happening in northern Uganda? Yeah. So Uganda has been at war for many years. And part of the strategy of one of the rebel groups \u2014 it\u2019s a group called the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, headed by a man named Joseph Kony \u2014 part of their strategy has been to abduct children, boys and girls, from their villages and from their tribes and take them off into the woods and essentially brainwash them and send them \u2026 They\u2019ve also had the children do horrible things, right, before they leave, killing their own siblings, so that they can\u2019t go back, they\u2019re so ashamed that their parents won\u2019t take them back, right? I mean, it\u2019s terrible. Yes. I mean, they send them back to kill their own families. Right. To kill members of their own villages, their own tribes, to maim them, to disfigure people unrecognizably, to cut off their lips and ears and noses. They give the girls as child brides to the soldiers. And through this really heartless, brutal tactic, you know, they do a couple of things. One is that they destroy the culture of these villages, the fabric of their own history. And they also create new foot soldiers for their army. The costs of this have been so high, both from a security point of view and from a cultural point of view, that many of the rank and file, just regular people living in Uganda, particularly this one group called the Acholi, have just simply grown so tired of these cycles of violence and their inability to solve them using military force that they\u2019ve really been pressing the government to offer amnesty \u2014 official amnesty, not only to Kony, but they\u2019ve been offering an official amnesty to any of the children, any of the sons and daughters of their own villages who\u2019ve been spirited away like this and brainwashed and turned into killers. And they\u2019ve used radio programs, radio broadcasts, word of mouth, newspapers, really any vehicle they can get hold of to send this message out: that if you will come back to your village, lay down your arms, meet with the elders, meet with the community, and work out a plan for demonstrating your desire to rejoin us, we\u2019ll let you rejoin us as a member of our community in good standing. That\u2019s pretty amazing, isn\u2019t it? And they\u2019ve been coming back in groups as large as 300, 400, 500, 900, laying down their guns, working out plans for reparation, right, trying to find some way to compensate victims for the harms they\u2019ve caused, at risk to themselves, mind you. I mean, these returnees now have to worry about these villagers\u2019 own desires for revenge against them. So they take a risk in coming back and yet many of them are doing it, and in part it really is because there just isn\u2019t another way. Here is a Welsh ethnomusicologist, Peter Cooke, describing how the very Ugandans Michael McCullough mentioned have integrated grief, outrage, and a longing for forgiveness in the music they sing. And their songs explicitly address warlord Joseph Kony. Now it\u2019s very interesting. They live in slums around Kampala. What do they sing about? First of all, they preserve some of the songs from their village competitions. \u201CWe are number one. We are the best group. We are going to win,\u201D this kind of thing. Secondly, they\u2019ll sing about this war in the north, how awful it is. But in the same song, when they\u2019re complaining that their women are raped, that their sisters give birth in the bush, and so on, they will say, \u201CKony, come talk with us. Come talk with us. Let\u2019s get it settled.\u201D \u201COtti\u201D \u2014 who\u2019s now dead, by the way, killed by Kony \u2014 \u201Ccome talk with us. It\u2019s time for peace.\u201D And this \u2014 these songs are being sung at the same time as bureaucracy overseas will say the international criminal court wants to arrest Kony and try him. There\u2019s a lot of forgiveness for the sake of a lasting peace and building one as soon as possible. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, \u201CGetting Revenge and Forgiveness,\u201D with research psychologist Michael McCullough. We replaced one of the truly awful dictators \u2026 Right. \u2026 of the late 20th century when we removed Saddam Hussein. You know the story there. And yet, it is also true that when we did that, and particularly when we disbanded the army, we did away with the only structure that was capable of holding a lot of very old tribal and ethnic and sectarian grudges in check. Right. This is a really interesting point you make, that strong governments \u2014 and it cuts both directions. Even repressive governments squelch or kind of take on all that revenge function, right? That\u2019s right. Yep. And so that helps me understand why sometimes when you have terrible regimes fall apart, Soviet Union or Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime and even in South Africa, some of these rivalries, these kind of primitive rivalries, if you want to call it that, come to the surface. That\u2019s right. I like to ask people to look out their windows in their office or their homes and imagine what your life would look like if the police and the National Guard and the fire department and the paramedics stopped working tomorrow, because of a natural disaster. People are hungry. People are \u2014 they have needs. And how would you put security into place yourself? What you would do is you would probably find your friends and find your family and you\u2019d circle the wagons. So in terms of what average people can do in the course of more ordinary lives, let me ask you the question this way. I mean, how do you think you live differently? How do you conduct yourself differently with, um, people you fundamentally disagree with on important social issues, with irritating people at work? How do you conduct yourself differently because of what you know scientifically in this research you do? The thing that I have realized is that many times if you\u2019ve been harmed by somebody, you don\u2019t have any choice but to try to forgive it on your own, because the person\u2019s gone, the person\u2019s dead, the person will have nothing to do with you. Right. There\u2019s just no bridge there. But in lots and lots of cases, forgiveness is just a conversation away. I mean, there are so many people if you ask them about the hurt that they remember from junior high or high school, what you often find is there was never any conversation back with that person who harmed them. Right. And so the conclusion I\u2019ve come to is in many, many cases if you want forgiveness, if you want to forgive or if you want to be forgiven, you need to go out there and get it for yourself. And the way you go out and get it for yourself is by trying to have the kind of conversation with the person you hurt that you want to have. In my family we apologize about a lot \u2026 Yeah, apology is an important concept for you. You say that it really, even biologically, it\u2019s important for us. Apology is really important, because when I apologize to you for something I\u2019ve done, you see me squirming. You see me uncomfortable. You see me trying to reassure you that I\u2019m not going to harm you in the same way again. You see me giving you respect as a human being with feelings. And all of a sudden, I\u2019ve turned on a lot of the slider switches that make forgiveness happen in your head. You say also that you\u2019ve made it the next best thing to revenge. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s fulfilled some of those needs we have. Oh, there are so many people who, once they see someone who\u2019s harmed them cry and experience shame and experience humiliation for the way they\u2019ve behaved, suddenly it\u2019s the forgiver who\u2019s doing the healing, right, who\u2019s reaching out to the perpetrator. This happens so many times. All people often need is this kind of vigorous conversation about the past. Now, if this were so easy, people would be doing it all day. Right. Right. So I don\u2019t pretend that. But at the same time, I really think we can\u2019t lose sight of the value of kind of getting in each other\u2019s business a little bit and getting in each other\u2019s lives a little bit and being willing to try to make things a little bit uncomfortable and a little bit messy in the service of making them better. And, I mean, again, when, if you just read the headlines, you read about what\u2019s going wrong in the world today, what are the worst most entrenched crises. I do sense from your research where you kind of try to take a global view and look at civil wars that have happened in recent years that have been resolved, I mean, that you kind of feel that there is progress, that on balance there\u2019s more reconciliation happening; is that right? Yeah. I\u2019m so optimistic about our future, because, again, if you look at that long arc of history, as you suggest, what you see is \u2014 for example, the homicide rate. We worry about the homicide rate, as we should. It goes up some years, it goes down other years, and \u2014 and we worry. But over the long arc of history \u2014 you take Western Europe \u2014 homicide rates are a twentieth and in some countries a fiftieth of what they were 600, 800 years ago, right? So if we take this long perspective, what seems to be happening is actually we\u2019re getting better and better control over human beings\u2019 potential for aggressiveness. And a lot of that homicide 600-800 years ago was in fact vengeance motivated. But when we get control of those instincts and we give people other tools to deal with their grievances, they will restrain themselves. So Iraq may look dismal to some. It\u2019s, you know, been terrible for our country and the world in so many ways, and yet I see coming out of it, whenever that is, a society that\u2019s going to rebuild itself into a peaceful society. I don\u2019t know how long it will take \u2014 it\u2019s above my pay grade, as they say, but this is what societies tend to do. They tend to find the best way to rebuild in the aftermath of these kinds of collapses in ways that will promote cooperation. And you\u2019re really saying that on the basis of lots of research, aren\u2019t you? I mean, this is not just wishful thinking. If you, I mean, if you put societal structures in place where people feel their rights are protected, and they feel that they see a way forward for making a living in a peaceful way, and you put incentives in place like that where there\u2019s security, they prefer peace over war, every time. Ms. Tippett: So from everything you know, I mean, what feels really important for you to pass on to your children practically? I have a four-year-old daughter who\u2019s a little bit too young for this still, but with our seven-year-old, I really have tried to encourage him to be vigorous about acknowledging his mistakes and the harms that he causes his friends, whether that\u2019s just a careless word or excluding somebody from a game or whatever, because so much of forgiveness comes down to interaction. It comes down to knowing that an offender is not the person you thought he was when he hurt you or she was when she hurt you. It\u2019s changing that perception. It\u2019s simple things, but we try to teach him that \u2014 what someone needs after they\u2019ve had their feelings hurt. We think if we can explain to him what the mind needs after someone\u2019s been offended, then we can teach him how to be vigorous and not worry about having to look like he\u2019s right all the time or having to look like he\u2019s perfect or denying his mistakes. If he can own up to them, that\u2019s a vigorous healthy way to keep his friendships intact. So, you know, I think a simplistic view, and you kind of touch on this in your book, of what religion can do in terms of forgiveness. When I look at all your research and have this conversation with you, it seems to me that in terms of where religion can play a constructive role in this, and religion is often implicated in places where there\u2019s terrible violence going on, but perhaps not in the first instance, teaching forgiveness, but some of the teachings that come out of religious traditions about caring for the other, about caring for the stranger. Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the best things we can do with religious faith is give people an appetite for difference. And the major world religions all have the resources for doing this, for getting people excited about people who are different from them. Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s not every brand, right, that exercises that prerogative, but in the scriptures and traditions of every world religion that has been successful on a grand scale, there is a story there about the love of difference. Compassion towards difference. Right. Compassion toward difference, caring for the strangers in your midst, being able to see beyond superficial differences toward the essential commonalities. Right. Religion is also good at appealing to people\u2019s meaner sides and the more brutish side, and the resources are there for both. So it\u2019s really up to those people who have a passion for reconciliation in their own faiths to make sure that the right tones are struck and the others are a little bit more muted. Something that I\u2019ve been aware of also is that this word \u201Cforgiveness\u201D I think has a really Christian ring in many ears. But I\u2019ve been very intrigued at, uh, you know, I remember speaking with a Holocaust survivor who said that, you know, for him the word \u201Cforgiveness\u201D just didn\u2019t do it and it has this cultural connotation of forgive and forget, but the Jewish phrase \u201Crepair the world,\u201D you know, compels him in the same way he feels the word \u201Cforgiveness\u201D compels Christians. I like that. I like that. I wish we could come up with a completely new word for what this human trait is. Other than forgiveness? Yeah. Or maybe find some new way to talk about it so that we could unload a little bit of the baggage from the past, because some of the baggage is that it\u2019s sort of a namby-pamby thing that doormats do or wimps do. Right. You know, only sort of milquetoast types of people are interested in. But from everything I\u2019ve managed to read and see and understand in my own work it\u2019s that forgiveness is a brawny muscular exercise that I kind of imagine someone with a great passion for life and a great hardy sort of disposition being able to take on. Wow. And you really feel that it\u2019s essential to our geopolitical future, right, as well our \u2014 the health of our individual lives. It\u2019s just too important. Yeah. It\u2019s just too important. And the doors are open now. The doors are open for the use of this kind of language in the public sphere.
