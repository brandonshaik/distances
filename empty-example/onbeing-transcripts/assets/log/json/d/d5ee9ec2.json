  "fullText": "Right up there with George Orwell\u2019s 1984, Hannah Arendt\u2019s books are new bestsellers. She wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism and coined the phrase, the \u201Cbanality of evil.\u201D The British historian Lyndsey Stonebridge muses that \u201Cif there is a bar in the underworld where the lost angels of history now hang out,\u201D Arendt is likely \u201Cdrawing on her eternal cigarette and issuing us a word of caution about the contemporary relevance of her work.\u201D But Stonebridge has written an evocative essay on the unexpected moral clarity Arendt holds for us now, with the title \u201CThinking and Friendship in Dark Times.\u201D There is familiarity in Arendt\u2019s statement a century ago that modern totalitarianism is \u201Corganized loneliness,\u201D that the historian knows how vulnerable facts always are, and her abiding belief, as a person who nearly perished in the 20th century\u2019s waves of terror and exile, that thinking is not something for elites; it is the human power to keep possibility alive. Thinking, she says, is not the same as judgment, but it creates the right conditions for judgment. But also, she says, if you can\u2019t have that inner dialogue, then you can\u2019t speak and act with others. What she called \u201Cthe banality of evil\u201D was the inability to hear another voice, the inability to have a dialogue either with oneself or the world, the moral world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Hannah Arendt, a German-Jewish philosopher, journalist, and political theorist, was born in in 1906 and died in 1975. She fled Germany with the rise of Adolf Hitler and ultimately became a US citizen. Lyndsey Stonebridge teaches modern literature and history at the University of East Anglia, but she was in southern France when we spoke. Are you on sabbatical? No. We have a slightly longer Easter vac \u2014 vacation \u2014 in Europe. And I spend as much time as I can down here because I have family here, and we have a house here. And it\u2019s where I get to write and think. I\u2019m also about an hour away from where Hannah Arendt was in a detention camp in Gurs. Oh, really? So every time I\u2019m around here, I always have a moment where I think about that and think about the people who came through Montauban, which is about an hour from here, which is a big refugee town, and Toulouse. So this area has got lots of Arendt in it, in some ways, for me. I wanted to ask you what, in the background of your life, inclined you to be captured by her passions and ideas? Are there points of resonance that go back for you as well? Yeah, I think it took me a long time to come to Arendt, because when I first read her as an undergraduate, and we all read The Origins of Totalitarianism, and it seemed like history. And it wasn\u2019t until the end of the Cold War when I started working on a book called The Judicial Imagination. And in that book, I wanted to understand how people judged the Holocaust, how people judged what had happened in World War II. And it was a sense of moral and historical clarity that she had. I was thinking about this this morning with the other figure who\u2019s very important to me, who\u2019s also a very strong Jewish woman was Melanie Klein, the psychoanalyst. And Klein had a question, which was, \u201CWhere does evil come from?\u201D And Hannah Arendt asked another question, which I think it\u2019s uniquely important, which is, \u201CHow, in modern times, is evil organized?\u201D Because we can\u2019t stop where evil comes from, but we can talk about how it\u2019s organized. We can try and understand that. So there\u2019s that. There\u2019s also \u2014 she was very committed to the idea that people who felt like they were outsiders and spectators in their worlds could have a contribution to make to that world, could understand that world from a certain perspective, and could engage with it. And actually \u2014 or being a pariah, being that you know you\u2019re coming from the outside, you know you\u2019re not quite right, and seizing that and running with it and working with it. And she also had that angle for me. I think, just for me, rereading The Origins of Totalitarianism, dipping back into her after quite a few years, that she wasn\u2019t just \u2014 this is not historical. It\u2019s not history-telling. It\u2019s really delving into the human essence of what we experience and analyze as political historical events. But something that struck me so much that I\u2019d forgotten is this idea about the isolation of \u2014 that she wrote, \u201CWhat prepares men for a totalitarian domination\u201D \u2014 and here, again, is what happens in the human heart and psyche and society that makes these things possible \u2014 \u201Cis the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience, usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses of our century.\u201D And if I think about the Brexit experience in the UK, and I think about this last presidential election in the US, so much of the dynamic were human beings who had felt unseen and feel disconnected. It\u2019s that language, she says, \u201Catomized, isolated individuals.\u201D Yeah. And she makes a further distinction in the last chapter of Origins of Totalitarianism, which she wrote later, between uprootedness, which is what people \u2014 since the Industrial Revolution, this has happened, but obviously, it\u2019s got worse \u2014 and in periods of economic crisis, it gets far worse \u2014 is not feeling recognized, not feeling at home. So it\u2019s a kind of malaise about rootedness. And then she contrasts and compares with superfluousness, which is not being not being treated like you\u2019re in the world at all. And that was the camps, and that is the refugee camps. So there\u2019s this awful relationship between the uprooted of the world, in Europe, in the States, and the new superfluous of the world, which she understood very well because she was one of the superfluous of the world in the 1940s. So I think she was very interested in that relationship. And I think you\u2019re absolutely right; the loneliness is absolutely crucial, but it\u2019s the question of how we imagine a response to that. I think it\u2019s very interesting \u2014 I discovered recently that Hannah Arendt taught George Orwell\u2019s 1984 to Berkeley undergraduates in 1955. Another new bestseller. Exactly. Another new \u2014 and what would one give to have been in that classroom? Right. Maybe your listeners were in Berkeley in 1955 being taught 1984 by Hannah Arendt. I would love to hear. And she had \u2014 I think she read the novel earlier because she started rewriting the last chapter of Origins of Totalitarianism. So she\u2019s getting that kind of analysis off Orwell. She\u2019s in dialogue with Orwell, who\u2019s, of course, dead by then. And he\u2019s saying, \u201CActually, this is what happens.\u201D The visional title of 1984 was The Last Man in Europe. I mean, if you can hear the Brexit resonance. [laughs] Yeah. The Last Man in Europe. And the loneliness. And the reason why Winston Smith is so drawn to Big Brother in the end is he cannot bear being alone. And I think you\u2019re absolutely right. Listening to that cri de c\u0153ur, that cry of the heart around not having a place to go. But I, on the other hand \u2014 she would have been, I think, very cautious of having too ready answers to what you do with that dilemma. I mean, she\u2019d been very, very suspicious of throwing up another worldview or ideology to end the loneliness or very \u2014 I think she\u2019d be very impatient with the way that those of us who are trying to react to our current scenarios, both in the UK and the US, are either turning on each other, or blaming the liberal elite, or blaming high capitalism, or blaming whatever. Making people un-lonely is a good project, but how that\u2019s going to happen, what politics you need for that to happen is going to be a very, very hard question. Right. Or even if politics is the place where that would start, if it would be a political project, which is a different kind of question to raise in the 21st century than it was in the 20th century\u2026 Absolutely. And that is something I wanted to ask you also because she had this insistence that people should be more political, which meant one thing for her, and maybe this is a way in which the foundation on which that idea was based in her century is so different. I mean, because politics itself is called into question in a different way as part of our crisis. Yeah. I was very interested about your question about imagination because I think we talk a lot today about empathy and suffering. And I\u2019m like Arendt. I\u2019m always a bit wary. It sounds like a terrible thing to say. I\u2019m really a bit wary about empathy. I really don\u2019t know about this. I wanted to ask you about that because when we talk \u2014 talking about loneliness, as we\u2019re discussing it in the context of her work, it\u2019s clearly the human condition, and it can be a personal experience. But it\u2019s not talking about loneliness as something that, if we can be compassionate towards each other\u2019s loneliness, things will get better. Well, I think for her \u2014 I mean, she was critical of pity, and she wrote very famously in her On Revolution book that what she didn\u2019t like about pity is it kept the power relationship. Other people\u2019s suffering for the one who\u2019s doing the pitying or the empathizing keeps the power. And also, she didn\u2019t like it because once you have suffering as your ground zero, you can allow for anything in the name to end that suffering. And that was the tragedy for her of the French Revolution. We have to be piteous in order to save the suffering people. And she\u2019s thinking about what it\u2019s like to imagine not being in the place you\u2019re in, to be imagine to be in the place of another. And that\u2019s slightly different from pity, and it\u2019s a slightly different take from empathy, because it involves something a bit harder, actually. So when she\u2019s teaching to Berkeley students in 1955, she says, \u201CImagine what it was like to have the political experience of a European, which is an experience totally unlike yours.\u201D And then she puts in brackets, \u201CA bit like mine, but totally unlike yours.\u201D [laughs] Right. Which I thought was very sweet given what she\u2019d just been through. And I think it\u2019s that kind of \u2014 what she says to do is not just to empathize, but which is to actually build blueprints, or worlds, or frames for understanding experience that is not ours, that cannot be incorporated into ours. So why I think it\u2019s different from empathy or pity is, when you are imagining \u2014 because you\u2019re imagining to be empathetic or to share suffering \u2014 you\u2019re immediately incorporating that experience into a view of yourself and your own worldview. What Arendt wanted was actually something a bit more radical than that, is to imagine something that\u2019s not your world, that makes you feel uncomfortable. And that\u2019s where the work has to start. And that\u2019s why she was also very committed to thinking. Right. To the activity of thinking. Yes. And\u2026 Which is how you do that. Which is how you do that. Right. And honestly, Americans have a very conflicted kind of relationship, historically and philosophically, with thought and ideas. It\u2019s a different thing than it was, for example, in the Germany that Hannah Arendt was raised in. The power of ideas. But it feels to me like there might be a receptivity now precisely because we see that it\u2019s not getting us anywhere to be meeting my emotion with your emotion. Her \u2014 as you say, you can only have moral imagination if you also think, if you are thinking. You talked in this podcast I heard you in that brought me to you, In Our Time, about how she always talked about the dialogue we have in our heads, that we are constantly working out what it means to be human, to be a person, whether we realize it or not. Yeah. I mean, she took this from Socrates and then from Heidegger, but her sense of what it meant to be a thinking person was always to be having the two-in-one dialogue in your head, that thinking wasn\u2019t about mastery. It wasn\u2019t about thinking about stuff in order to control it or to rationalize it. Thinking was a way of being. It was a way \u2014 the passion of being was in thinking. And that comes from that two-in-one dialogue in one\u2019s head. And for her, that was \u2014 the beginning of moral life comes in that dialogue. There also follows \u2014 there is a notion of judgment that comes through thinking and dialogue. And the ability, I mean\u2026 Discernment. Reflection. Well, she\u2019ll say \u2014 I mean, thinking, she says, is not the same as judgment, but it creates the right conditions for judgment. But also, she says, if you can\u2019t have that inner dialogue, then you can\u2019t speak and act with others either because it\u2019s part of \u2014 if you\u2019re already divided in yourself because you\u2019re having this conversation with yourself, and that\u2019s the passion of your being, people who can do that can actually then move on to having conversations with other people and then judging with other people. And what she called \u201Cthe banality of evil\u201D was the inability to hear another voice, the inability to have a dialogue either with oneself or the imagination to have a dialogue with the world, the moral world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with historian Lyndsey Stonebridge, exploring the present-day resonance of the 20th-century thinker Hannah Arendt. Arendt coined the phrase \u201Cthe banality of evil\u201D in her 1963 book about the Jerusalem trial of Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann. So one of her famous phrases is the \u201Cbanality of evil,\u201D which was an observation she made about Eichmann, and that was controversial. But you said something about the bureaucratization, which was part of that banality, a refuge for \u2014 instead of thinking, you are part of the system, and you follow the rules, and you enact the rules. And again, not to \u2014 I really would not compare Eichmann to anyone alive right now in full, but the revulsion and the sense of alienation people all over the place have from bureaucracy, which in our age is globalized, right? The way the phrase \u201Cthe government\u201D will be received in many places in the US, the way the phrase \u201Cthe EU\u201D is received in England, there are echoes of something that goes wrong \u2014 something that goes wrong in human societies that were still with us or we\u2019re feeling again. I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I think it\u2019s \u2014 one of the first things Arendt did when she finally got to New York, one of her first jobs was to help edit Kafka\u2019s diaries. You remember the story of The Castle near the stranger is kind of a \u2014 it\u2019s certainly a migrant story. You know, stranger arrives in a new place, he comes for work, and then he can\u2019t work out what\u2019s going on, and he can\u2019t settle, and he\u2019s blocked by this bureaucracy that no one understands. It sounds like any kind of \u2014 anyone who\u2019s worked with refugees or migrants in the last 10 years will know all too well K\u2019s experience as he tries to make good on the offer of work for the castle. I think it\u2019s very interesting that she actually chose that. I mean, she chose it because it resonated with her experience. But it goes back to the earlier conversation. I suppose the more we become fearful for what we call life, what we try bureaucratize to keep other people out, the worse it gets. And also with the kind of \u2014 with the logic that is no logic. I mean, that\u2019s the other thing. It\u2019s the capricious nature of bureaucracy. I mean, if I think about the EU\u2026 Even well-meaning bureaucracy takes on these dehumanizing characteristics. Well, this is the very interesting. Exactly. I mean, this is where humanitarianism is a very good example of \u2014 how do we administer for human life? And once you start to administer human life, you have very difficult decisions to make. And before you know it, you are in a situation where you\u2019re running very close to not committing atrocities but getting very, very close to causing harm rather than doing good. If you talk to people who work for big aid agencies, you talk to people who worked and then left big aid, this is the bureaucratization of human life brings with it this penalty, even when you think you are doing good. Which is why our home secretary, Amber Rudd, who was trying to explain why Britain would not be taking any more child refugees across from France, said it was a bad policy because it encouraged child refugees. And I felt like one of those judges or someone sitting there in Jerusalem in 1961 thinking, \u201CI\u2019m sorry?\u201D \u201CYou\u2019re not helping child refugees because it might encourage more child refugees to come? Really? Is this a moral position?\u201D No, it\u2019s an administrative position. And it\u2019s one that \u2014 I don\u2019t think these people are evil, but I think they run very, very close to the wind. [laughs] And that kind of \u2014 at best, I\u2019m thinking; at worst, it\u2019s cynical. Right. I mean, let\u2019s talk about refugees. It\u2019s an important topic for you. With our news cycle, we kind of lurch from one drama to the next of what happened today that\u2019s really important, right? What happened today that mattered? I often just kind of step back and think somebody looking back 100 years from now, looking at this day \u2014 what will they see was happening in the world that, in fact, was important? And I feel like this refugee crisis that is so huge, and ongoing, and unresolved, and no vision for resolving, or even a sense of what that would mean, might be that thing. And I know that\u2019s more present in Europe. And I mean, I wonder if you think if Hannah Arendt could come back with her cigarette in hand today, how she might ask us to be looking at this thing that is also happening kind of between and above and below and behind all the politics that we are paying attention to. Yeah. I think she might say very politely, \u201CI did tell you.\u201D And I think, for me, the so-called \u201Crefugee crisis\u201D is actually part of a continuous history that Arendt gives us the tools to understand, partly because of her thinking, and partly because she lived it, so it\u2019s a really clear example of her living through thinking. She was an \u201Cenemy alien,\u201D as we said. She was an enemy alien. Stateless person. She was a refugee. She was stateless for 18 years of her life. And I think if you look \u2014 one of my favorite essays from Arendt is an essay she published in 1943 for the Menorah Journal called \u201CWe Refugees,\u201D and it\u2019s very, very biting. And she understood very well. She said before, the word \u201Cexile\u201D used to be \u2014 exiles used to be treated as sort of sacred figures or \u2014 hospitality in a war. I read that. That\u2019s so interesting to think about. \u201CEverywhere the word \u2018exile,\u2019 which once had an undertone of almost sacred awe, now provokes the idea something simultaneously suspicious and unfortunate.\u201D That\u2019s right. Yeah. And that, I mean, she said that \u2014 I think she said that in \u201843 as well. And what she\u2019s very, very good on is saying, \u201CActually, this isn\u2019t a problem for refugees. This isn\u2019t a refugee crisis. This is a crisis for the European nation states, a crisis for what we think we\u2019re doing. OK?\u201D And I think that really needs to be put firmly \u2014 the refugee problem isn\u2019t just a problem for people who happen to be refugees. It\u2019s a problem for everybody because it\u2019s a problem about how we\u2019re deciding to run our countries and our politics. Why I think she\u2019s very, very good today is she understood that humanitarianism or human rights would not be the answer to the question that was posed by people who, for whatever reason, found themselves outside the nation state. And she \u2014 one of the first things she pointed out is that what was exposed by the refugee crisis of the last century was how so-called human rights were actually political and national rights. So you were only \u2014 you only had as many rights as were guarded by the country in which you happened to be born. Once that country decided to decitizenize you, once it decided that you were no longer a citizen, once it decided that it had no more responsibilities towards you, you were rightless. She said the world \u2014 she said very famously, \u201CThe world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.\u201D \u201CThe world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.\u201D So then the question is, well, OK, so how are we going to have a political community that is hospitable, that is going to work in terms of protecting rights? And one thing is, she said, after the war, refugees themselves didn\u2019t tend to call for human rights. They tend to call for their own nation. They called for what? Their own nation. Their own nation. Yes, yes. Because people know that they will be protected. And that\u2019s going to be such a different set of questions, again, in the 21st century. Yes, it is. It is. It\u2019s just not the proposal anyone would make. Exactly. Exactly. But she did. And I think she was very \u2014 she would have predicted \u2014 she had this expression \u2014 and you\u2019ll remember because you\u2019ve read it recently in The Origins of Totalitarianism \u2014 called the \u201Cdark background of difference,\u201D where you no longer have entitlements or presence. You no longer have rights as you disappear into the dark background of difference, where, she said, the more interconnected the world gets, the more global it gets, the bigger the dark background of difference is going to get. Right. And therefore, the more threatened \u2014 the more threatened people \u2014 consider themselves to be in political nation states, the more threatened they\u2019re going to be. So you\u2019re in this kind of \u2014 in a scenario that is like a zero-sum game, so to speak. And that is where we are, and it\u2019s interesting, I mean, it\u2019s terribly interesting \u2014 interesting in a terrible way \u2014 I think that with globalization, which is not necessarily a word she would have used or predicted \u2014 but with globalization, there was this assumption, which actually didn\u2019t rest on a very sophisticated examination of the human condition \u2014 but there was this assumption that we would just grow out of that, right? Yeah. But what she understood, because she was looking at the human condition, and taking that seriously, is that, as you say, that \u201Cdark background\u201D, that this would become a crisis again. Yeah, yeah. And she was also \u2014 I mean, she did \u2014 if you read The Human Condition, which is \u2014 I recommend to cheer you up, actually in these dark, dark times. Thank you. I have not read that one. Yeah. What is it? It\u2019s a model of \u2014 she\u2019ll talk about the importance of new beginnings, the importance of natality, the importance of action, the importance of speaking. And she\u2019ll talk about the world \u2014 she\u2019ll talk about \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s a book that\u2019s concerned with worldliness. And she\u2019ll talk about the storybook of mankind, like we\u2019re all connected, and we\u2019re all part of the world. But she says the more \u2014 globalization is about the accumulation of capital. It\u2019s expansion for expansion\u2019s sake. It will not produce more equality. It will produce more inequality, hence the background of difference. So trying to work for a worldliness that\u2019s genuinely worldly, as against a worldliness, which is actually about accumulation expansion for expansion\u2019s sake, which will increase the divides between people. She would have understood that. I mean, she would\u2019ve been so impolite to say, \u201CI told you so.\u201D I don\u2019t think she would have done. She would\u2019ve been thinking it. You can listen again and share this conversation with Lyndsey Stonebridge through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with historian Lyndsey Stonebridge, exploring how the 20th-century philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt might speak to us now. Arendt famously coined the phrase \u201Cthe banality of evil\u201D and wrote towering works like The Human Condition and The Origins of Totalitarianism. She was concerned with the human essence of events that we analyze as historical and political. She wrote, for example, that totalitarianism is \u201Corganized loneliness,\u201D that loneliness is the \u201Ccommon ground for terror.\u201D Arendt was a German Jew who fled the Holocaust and spent 18 years as a refugee, a \u201Cstateless person,\u201D before eventually becoming a US citizen. Before we kind of leave the refugee crisis behind, I \u2014 obviously, we\u2019re not going to come up with a game plan right here and \u2014 could we say what Hannah Arendt \u2014 maybe you can \u2014 what she would direct us to do right now. I just want to underscore a point you make in your writing, that we need to be pondering this, and we need to be having a kind of conversation including that inner conversation. I mean, you say \u2014 and you\u2019re channeling Arendt \u2014 \u201CWhen you have a refugee crisis, what you also have is a political, existential, and moral crisis about what a country is and who its citizens are.\u201D And you also point out that possibly the reason this makes us panic is because what it puts before our eyes is, as you say, that if human rights are contingent that we in fact are all vulnerable. And of course, that is a terrifying thing. It\u2019s a terrifying specter. But then we retreat. We respond to that vulnerability in a way that is punitive. Yeah. And if you stop to \u2014 I mean, I do think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that vulnerability. So if you stop to think about it with refugees \u2014 when you\u2019re a refugee, you become a refugee just by where you happen to be born and when you happen to be born. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s the accident of birth. It\u2019s the accident of birth that makes you either American or European or British or English, as well. So it is purely contingent. And I think there\u2019s something about that that people really do find threatening. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ll get people sort of somehow imagining where they happen to be born entitles them to more than someone else who happens to have been born somewhere else. [laughs] When will you stop me? In The Human Condition, Arendt borrows a phrase that she takes from Herodotus called isonomia, which is the principle of equal liberty. And she says you need to have a political community which is capable of responding to isonomia, or this principle of equal liberty. And it\u2019s \u2014 basically, the principle of equal liberty says, \u201CWell, how come I\u2019ve got total freedom of movement and you haven\u2019t? How come my child gets a really good education and yours doesn\u2019t? How come my mom can grow vegetables in her garden, and your mother\u2019s garden\u2019s just been blown to bits? That\u2019s not good enough.\u201D And she says we need to have \u2014 there needs to be enough in the way we think about political democratic life to allow citizens and people to act on the principle of equal liberty. And on the one hand, the situation we have now is a kind of phobic repudiation of vulnerability, everyone\u2019s vulnerability, which is very, very bad. But on the other hand\u2026 It\u2019s a rejection of vulnerability as though it is something we could reject\u2026 It\u2019s a rejection. Exactly. \u2026or say, \u201CWe will not be vulnerable.\u201D Exactly. \u201CWe will not be vulnerable. And we can prove this.\u201D Right. But on the other hand, I mean, remember the biggest refugee populations now are not actually in Europe, they\u2019re in Jordan, they\u2019re in Lebanon, they\u2019re in Turkey. They\u2019re in communities which quite often are refugee communities themselves. I mean, some of the biggest people have hosted refugees are existing either Palestinian or Kurdish or the Christian communities in the Middle East, who are literally making space for a new generation of refugees. That\u2019s not always an easy relationship. I don\u2019t want to idealize the local. I don\u2019t want to idealize the idea of refugee to refugee humanitarianism because it comes with all those difficulties. But it does seem to me that the principle of equal liberty or isonomia, is working effectively elsewhere in the world. So it should not be beyond the wit and wisdom of the rest of us to use a bit more moral imagination because it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s not happening. It is. And it also is happening both in Europe and in the States with the people who Arendt would have called the new people with a new generation of activists. Yeah. You said something so important just a minute ago, and I want to dwell with that a little bit, that \u2014 so there\u2019s a danger in invoking somebody like Hannah Arendt that here we\u2019re bringing in this great intellectual, and that somehow that implies abstraction or that this is not thinking, or even the way she thought about thinking is not for ordinary people. But what you just said about her validation of the the actual power and freedom of a human being to keep idea and possibility alive. But her insisting that our power to say I don\u2019t want to live this way, I don\u2019t want my children to have opportunities that are simply unthinkable for children in that neighborhood over there. And the power of putting those questions and those longings, and that kind of insistence out in the world. Yeah, and I think also \u2014 I do my thinking on the ground, which I think is what you\u2019re saying there is the issue. Thinking is not abstraction, it\u2019s not just something that happens in the universities or for the liberal elite, between the covers of The New Yorker. We\u2019re all thinking, all doing it all the time. And I think \u2014 but in a concrete way. One thing that you \u2014 I\u2019ve heard you say about her thinking that felt very resonant for me is \u2014 and also in terms of this equal liberty idea, that \u201Cwhat we need are vibrant communities that can change without risk, a community that is OK with promising and a culture of forgiveness.\u201D Can you talk about those ideas? Yeah. She says that in The Human Condition. OK. It\u2019s just the \u2014 modern life, the human condition, is unpredictable. Since the advent of modernity, we\u2019ve had rapid change. The world has become unpredictable in new ways. So I think she says for the first time ever, she\u2019s writing this in the late \u201850s the pace of technological change has outstripped man\u2019s ability to adapt to change. So there\u2019s a whole set of things that\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s more true now than it was then. Yeah. Oh, exactly. It\u2019s just \u2014 we thought Star Trek looked scary. That\u2019s far truer. Post-reformation, we\u2019ve got the turn to the self, we\u2019ve got new technology that\u2019s just outpacing our ability to be, we\u2019ve got a kind of sense of the world slipped off its axis. So how does the human condition function in a world like that? How would anything like a political community help? And she says the two things you need is on the one hand the ability to make and honor promises. Anyone who\u2019s a parent knows how this works. You have to say this will happen, and it will happen. I will make sure it happens. Right. And every once in awhile it won\u2019t, but you\u2019re saying that there needs to be a foundation of that, that we trust each other. There needs to be the faith. Someone, who is \u2014 \u201CI promise you that this will happen.\u201D Mm-hmm. But in order to keep good on that, you also \u2014 and it took me ages to understand this \u2014 you need a culture of forgiveness. And it took me quite a long time to understand this, because I\u2019m not a very naturally forgiving person, if I\u2019m totally honest with myself. And also, my image of Arendt was always, oh she\u2019s kind of really tough and she talks truth to lots of things. What\u2019s this stuff about forgiveness? It sounds a bit meh. And what she means is if you\u2019re going to have a culture that takes risks, if you\u2019re going to embody risks, and if we\u2019re going to get to anything like equal liberty or better \u2014 a better political cultural, or at least a culture of ideas, you\u2019re going to have to take risks. And if you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019re going to get things wrong. And you\u2019re going to make errors. And so, a mature political community needs the capacity for forgiveness to accept that things go wrong. People make mistakes. And I think that again if you turn back to your earlier point about the culture in Great Britain and the US at the moment, one of the responses to that loneliness is people to want an alternative, which is a fantasy, where everything will be looked after. \u201CWe\u2019re going to we\u2019re going to do this, and it will be fine.\u201D And so the capacity to have a kind of political community based on, well, it\u2019s going to be imperfect. The way both our recent elections were fought were on absolutes. Right. There are promises been made that can\u2019t be kept. Promises that can\u2019t be kept, and watch and wait. But also a kind of infantilization of electorates which goes \u2014 \u201CWe will make the world safe.\u201D And you think, \u201CAre you kidding? I\u2019m 52 years old. I know you\u2019re not going to make the world safe. Feed me another line.\u201D Yeah. But also, the \u201Cculture of forgiveness\u201D to me feels very important to put out there. It feels also very countercultural right now. I mean, there\u2019s also this hardening of lines, you know? You were for that, or you voted for that candidate, or against that, or against that candidate. And then there\u2019s this whole world of assumptions made about you. And even at the same time that we\u2019re very frustrated with people on the other side, whatever the other side is, we will not let them change, right? I mean, the minute anything shifts or there\u2019s some kind of conciliatory move made authentic or not, it\u2019s immediately swatted down. I mean, this idea of \u2014 what did you say \u2014 a mature culture of forgiveness that means the \u2014 kind of a pact in the middle of our life together that says we want to change, we will extend some modicum of openness. Yeah. I think it\u2019s also a question of where that happens, though, because my \u2014 I think in big politics, the cynicism \u2014 and it\u2019s a cynicism that\u2019s utterly deserved \u2014 is, \u201CI\u2019m not going to play that game because I know you\u2019re just playing a game. I know this is a game.\u201D And when Arendt talks about \u2014 when she \u2014 I think it\u2019s one of the moving passages of Origins of Totalitarianism \u2014 she invokes Augustine, who she wrote her dissertation on. And she wrote her dissertation on Augustine\u2019s notion of love. And he would talk about worldly love, appetite, desire, which is love of the future, transcendent love, which is the love of God, which is the past. And the love that she was really interested in was neighborly love, which is neither wanting transcendence nor wanting something or someone. It\u2019s just the love that says, \u201CI want you to be.\u201D And she returns to that saying of Augustine, the idea of neighborly love in The Origins of Totalitarianism, but she says that\u2019s the kind of love that\u2019s available in the dark background of difference. It\u2019s not the love that you\u2019re going to find on the political stage. It is \u2014 because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got in the dark background of difference is neighborly love, in her phrasing. And it\u2019s very interesting to me that she doesn\u2019t try and find it in the political, which was the sine qua non for her. The political theater was everything to her. But she said, no, actually, love, that kind of neighborly love, is in the dark background of difference. And it is there. She\u2019ll also say love is something, as soon as you bring it into the light of day, it kind of crumbles in the sunlight. It disappears. So I think if you were going to say something, if I had said to her now, \u201CLet\u2019s have a culture of political forgiveness,\u201D and she\u2019d look at me, and she\u2019d say, \u201COh grow up.\u201D \u201CNo. Look at these guys. Are you kidding me?\u201D Right. So, politics is where it\u2019s become a caricature, where we have a caricature of the opposite of that in fact. Right, so I would never say a political culture of forgiveness, because that would not be reasonable or realistic but a culture of forgiveness, we don\u2019t need our politicians, do we? Yeah. Exactly, yeah. To start having a culture? No, I think\u2026 To shifting our culture? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I think that will come back to what she says about creating a space where you can think, because once you start having these conversations with yourself and with others, and once you start imagining yourself in another place, then forgiveness does follow. Why she was very passionate about education, I think she did \u2014 she kind of idolized education in the sense that she would have liked the kind of great German idea of the Bildung to be available to everybody\u2026 It\u2019s formation. It\u2019s not just education. That word is \u201Cformation.\u201D Exactly. It\u2019s formation. And I think she was romantic about that, but she was also \u2014 we need spaces where we can think and try these ideas out. And you\u2019re not going to have anything like even a local community or political culture of anything like that can keep its promises or forgive unless people are allowed to think. And that\u2019s the thing about \u2014 going back to your earlier point about loneliness. In order to think, you actually \u2014 in a way you need to be in a \u2014 in a culture which allows you, which endorses that process of thinking. Yeah. Yes, and creates space for it, even. And you need to make it a culture \u2014 that kind of makes sense when she says the final, late chapter of Origins of Totalitarianism and actually she\u2019s responding to George Orwell here. She says two plus two will never make five. That\u2019s not the problem. And George Orwell at the end, Winston\u2019s being tortured, and he\u2019s made to say two plus two equals five, and this is like totalitarianism makes us all lie. She said that\u2019s not the power. It\u2019s the fact that in a world where people are going to say it is even when they know it isn\u2019t. That is deeply estranging. That\u2019s what creates those conditions of loneliness and despair. That, for her, is the wickedness of the political lie. People don\u2019t believe that two plus two makes five. They don\u2019t believe half of what\u2019s said. But that we can get ourselves and others to the point where we might say something like that, some equivalent of that. Yeah. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with historian Lyndsey Stonebridge, exploring the present-day resonance of the 20th-century thinker Hannah Arendt. We\u2019re going to have to wind down here, but I\u2019ve got so much else I want to talk about. But I want to talk briefly and this flows on that I think of the idea of lying. Yeah. Which was a \u2014 one of those elements of totalitarianism, very much a subject alive in American politics now that \u2014 but something I\u2019m very intrigued getting a little bit deeper into this in reading her \u2014 and I\u2019ve thought a lot about \u2014 we had already had a \u2014 like a lot of things right now, it\u2019s just out on the surface, what was already kind of fermenting. We already had a crisis of truth, or not being able to speak about truth in a complex way. And we\u2019ve been relying on facts, and facts were never enough. A nd she makes these \u2014 like, here\u2019s her essay \u201CLying in Politics.\u201D She says that \u201Cfactual truths,\u201D here\u2019s that. \u201CFactual truths are never compellingly true. The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life. It is always in danger of being perforated by single lies, or torn to shreds. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy domain of human affairs. From this it follows that no factual statement can ever be beyond doubt.\u201D Take us inside that and what that means for us now. I think, yeah, I think she\u2019s \u2014 she \u2014 for Arendt, I think why the idea of thinking and speaking as a form of action are important to her is that what she\u2019s saying there is \u2014 you can throw enough facts, you can throw all the facts you like at people, and they will not stick. We had this, in the UK, and I know you have, too, that it\u2019s \u2014 \u201COK, against the false news we\u2019ll have fact-finding, and we\u2019ll tell you. And we\u2019ll have a team of researchers, and you just have to look on our website, and we\u2019ll tell you which of those are lies.\u201D And you can scream facts at people until you\u2019re blue in the face, and a lot of colleagues and universities and journalists have been doing exactly that very hard, working tirelessly. And it\u2019s not making any difference. And I think what she\u2019s talking about there is the ability through thinking and communal discourse, to make truth meaningful in the world, it has to happen between people. Right. Which is not saying we just make up our own reality. She\u2019s not saying that. It means that this is why\u2026 When she says testimony, it needs\u2026 Testimony. It needs experience. It needs human experience around it. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think she \u2014 that was why testimony was important to her. It\u2019s why history and the sense of a myth were all important to her because it\u2019s what makes truth meaningful to people together in a community. If you want a culture that\u2019s going to take on fake news, and the political lie, I say as someone who teaches literature and history, what you need is a culture of the arts and humanity. What you need is more storytelling. What you need is more discourse. What you need is more imagination. What you need is more creation in that way, and more of a sense of what it is that ties us to those words and ties us to those stories. Yeah. We need three dimensional \u2014 we need stories and facts and conversations between people and all of that working together. Right? Yeah. I mean, it reminds me very much of when Arendt went back to Germany to collect the Lessing prize, which she was given. She gave a speech. And Lessing was this great humanist and great believer in dialogue. And one thing she said to her audience, \u201CI\u2019m talking to you as a Jewish person. You need to take that on board.\u201D And what she said \u2014 what would not have been helpful during the Third Reich is to say, \u201CJews and Germans are part of the same humanity. We all love each other.\u201D She said, because that would have been to totally disregard the reality that you\u2019re living in a political system that says one of you is not. Far better, she says, to say a German, and a Jew, and friends. So you acknowledge the reality of the racial politics, that is making an idea of a shared humanism impossible. But you\u2019re maintaining its possibility by acknowledging that reality and doing your stuff in spite of that. And I think that there\u2019s something in your story and in Arendt\u2019s story there which does resonate. It\u2019s your \u2014 she would have been very suspicious of a false type of humanitarianism that tried to pretend that the politics of race weren\u2019t violent and horrible and real, and real in a lot of ways that are unimaginable for a lot of people, but, you acknowledge that, and then you say, and still, and still we\u2019re going to sit in this studio together and still we\u2019re going to read this text together and still we\u2019re going to do this together. And I think \u2014 so I think it\u2019s something, I mean, the kind of toughie in me wants to say you stick with that reality. Yeah. Right. It was both/and, right? it\u2019s \u2014 again, it\u2019s thinking. It is allowing the complexity of reality in. And it\u2019s never \u2014 it\u2019s always messy. Yeah. The Origins of Totalitarianism ends with these words. It says, \u201CBut there remains also the truth that every end in history necessarily contains a new beginning. This beginning is the promise, the only \u2018message\u2019 which the end can never produce. Beginning before it becomes a historical event is the supreme capacity of man. Politically it is identical with man\u2019s freedom.\u201D And then she writes, \u201CThis beginning is guaranteed by each new birth. It is indeed every man.\u201D I mean, those are very lofty words, and really kind of surprising at the end of this book, which is about the darkest depths of humanity. But I want to just \u2014 you reflecting on all of this are talking about \u2014 you just used the word \u201Cfriendship\u201D like very concrete on the ground ways to realize what she said. You know, you \u2014 when you had this scenario that I read earlier. You know, \u201Cshe might conclude saying to us you\u2019d be best advised and make some new friends so that together you can learn to think without bannisters.\u201D Is that a phrase of hers, \u201Cthink without bannisters?\u201D \u201CThink without bannisters\u201D is her phrase, yeah. How would you \u2014 I mean, which is in response to the Holocaust in particular. It means, once the impossible has been made possible, how do we judge? How do we think? And that was her motivating question. But her concern with beginnings or what she called natality, I mean, Heidegger was always being towards death. She was always being towards the possibility of life. And I think it came through in two ways in her life. One is through friendship, because each new encounter, especially when you\u2019re actually out of your bubble. I mean, she\u2019s talking about \u2014 when I talk about people working refugee-to-refugee humanitarianism, but that\u2019s a difficult kind of friendship. It\u2019s a friendship that has to work. But also, when I was looking in her teaching file, which really brought home to me is the importance of her students, the importance of the people she called \u201Cthe new people.\u201D And I think \u2014 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to have the education, the political free education that Arendt dreamed of, that formation. But I think that kind of affirmation of teaching, of listening to students, of empowering students, of making it possible for students to create their kind of \u2014 their new ideas of citizenship. Those are the things she believed in very strongly. And the older I get, and the darker the times get, for me, and I know a lot of other people who work in universities and schools feel this, the place where I see new birth are in my students. And I think they are that is the beginning. Out of the darkest times there can be a new beginning. And we need to step back and shut up, sometimes, and do the most we can to make sure that happens. Lyndsey Stonebridge is a professor of Modern Literature & History at the University of East Anglia in Norfolk, England. She\u2019s the author of The Judicial Imagination: Writing after Nuremberg as well as a wonderful essay, \u201CThinking Without Banisters\u201D for the UK\u2019s Jewish Quarterly magazine. I\u2019d also recommend the trenchant archive of Arendt-related reflection at the brilliant Brainpickings curated by Maria Popova \u2014 find that at Brainpickings.org."
