  "fullText": "\u201CSometimes it takes darkness and the sweet confinement of your aloneness to learn anything or anyone that does not bring you alive is too small for you.\u201D All of David Whyte\u2019s writing points at what he calls \u201Cthe conversational nature of reality.\u201D He\u2019s a poet and philosopher who believes in the power of a \u201Cbeautiful question\u201D amidst the drama of work as well as the drama of life \u2014 amidst the ways the two overlap, whether we want them to or not. He shared a deep friendship with the late Irish philosopher John O\u2019Donohue, an all-time favorite conversation partner of mine. They were, David Whyte says, like \u201Ctwo bookends.\u201D More recently, he\u2019s written about the consolation, nourishment, and underlying meaning of everyday words. One of the things the Irish say is that \u201Cthe thing about the past is it\u2019s not the past.\u201D It\u2019s right here in this room, in this conversation. That\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. David Whyte is perhaps best known for his book The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America. Of both English and Irish descent, he\u2019s lived in the U.S. at least part of the time for many years. David, I \u2014 for some reason, I had either heard you referred to as an Irish poet or I had referred to you as an Irish poet, but \u2014 I lived in the U.K. for a little while, and I thought maybe your accent had gotten a little bit muddled up by living in the States too much. And then when I read that you grew up in Yorkshire and that you\u2019re not all Irish, that made perfect sense to me. But \u2026 Yes. It\u2019s \u2014 my accent is a movable frontier, I think. And I grew up with an Irish accent in the house, through my mother. And all the usual Irish sayings and imaginings \u2014 and then spent quite a bit of time in Ireland, and then came to the States in my adulthood. So I think my accent\u2019s about 40 miles off the coast of County Clare. Somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. Yes. Would you explain for people who don\u2019t know \u2014 you talk about growing up \u2014 it was your mother who was Irish, right? And your father was\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026from Yorkshire, and that there was this interplay in you between imaginative Irish and the grounded Yorkshire. Yes. Ireland has its own kind of grounding, but it\u2019s grounded in the imagination and in subverting the foundations of everyday life. And Yorkshire is very much here in the world \u2014 very workaday. But sometimes Yorkshire is so grounded, it\u2019s surreal. And it comes out \u2014 it turns into its opposite. So Yorkshire\u2019s a place where the Industrial Revolution started in the world, but it\u2019s also the place of Emily Bront\u00EB\u2019s moors, the wildness of the dales \u2014 quite remote places. I remember, when I was seven or eight years old, realizing that I wasn\u2019t supposed to choose between the two places even though they were so different. I was supposed to live out my life, nowadays, I would say \u2014 I would put words into my mouth as a seven-year-old and say I was supposed to live out the conversation between them both. But it was \u2014 something felt physically very close. And, of course, my work as a poet and philosopher has matured into working with what I call \u201Cthe conversational nature of reality,\u201D which is the fact that we don\u2019t get to choose so often between things we hope we can choose between. Well, I want to talk about that very shortly. And before we do \u2014 was there a spiritual background to that childhood of yours? Or religious background? I would say it was spiritual by osmosis rather than anything. My mother and her family had undergone the traumas which have now become well known within the Catholic Church. So my \u2014 I\u2019d say the spirituality for me was in the land and the land of Yorkshire and the moors. It was very powerful, indeed. And you can feel that spirituality if you read Emily Bront\u00EB and that sense of horizon and distance and invitation that\u2019s there. And then I was very intrigued to learn that you actually got your degree in marine zoology and that you actually began your working life as a naturalist and were in the Galapagos and the Amazon, Himalayas. Were you also writing poetry then? Well, I\u2019ve written poetry since I was very small. I had very powerful experiences with poetry where I felt literally abducted, taken away by poetry, and \u2014 just like a hawk had come down and taken me in its claws and carried me off. And I remember reading Ted Hughes when I was young \u2014 and he must\u2019ve been young then, too \u2014 and having that feeling, a very powerful feeling, that this was language that adults had written who had not forgotten the primary visions and insights of childhood. But when I was 14 years old, I saw Jacque Cousteau, the famous French marine zoologist and inventor of the aqualung, sail across our little television set in the north of England. And I really couldn\u2019t believe that you could have work like this in the world. You could actually follow the life of the dolphin aboard the good ship Calypso. And I was so astonished by it that I gave up all my art subjects and put myself into the salt mines of biology, chemistry, and physics. Then I emerged with a degree in marine zoology many years later. And then, through sheer luck and fortune, I found myself on the shores of the Galapagos Islands as a naturalist guide. And that was really astonishing. And that \u2014 experiencing those islands led me back into poetry and philosophy, really. That makes sense. So it was a long, long circuit. But it does illustrate some of the conversations that are \u2014 this phrase that you mentioned a moment ago that\u2019s so pivotal for you, \u201Cthe conversational nature of reality.\u201D Some of the conversations you have worked with between things that might not seem to naturally belong together, but that have been your life, and the stuff of your philosophy and your poetry. Yes. I went back into poetry because I felt like scientific language wasn\u2019t precise enough to describe the experiences that I had in Galapagos. Science, rightly, is always trying to remove the \u201CI.\u201D But I was really interested in the way that the \u201CI\u201D deepened the more you paid attention. And in Galapagos, I began to realize that, because I was in deeply attentive states, hour after hour watching animals and birds and landscapes \u2014 and that\u2019s all I did for almost two years \u2014 I began to realize that my identity depended not upon any beliefs I had, inherited beliefs or manufactured beliefs, but my identity actually depended on how much attention I was paying to things that were other than myself. And that as you deepen this intentionality and this attention, you started to broaden and deepen your own sense of presence. And I began to realize that the only place where things were actually real was at this frontier between what you think is you and what you think is not you. That whatever you desire of the world will not come to pass exactly as you will like it. But the other mercy is that whatever the world desires of you will also not come to pass. And what actually occurs is this meeting, this frontier. But it\u2019s astonishing how much time human beings spend away from that frontier, abstracting themselves out of their bodies, out of their direct experience, and out of a deeper, broader, and wider possible future that\u2019s waiting for them if they hold the conversation at that frontier level. Half of what\u2019s about to occur is unknown, both inside you and outside you. John O\u2019Donohue, a mutual friend of both of us, used to say that one of the necessary tasks is this radical letting alone of yourself in the world. Letting the world speak in its own voice and letting this deeper sense of yourself speak out. I love the Consolations book. The subtitle of that is \u201CThe Solace, Nourishment, and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words.\u201D And the word that comes first is \u201Calone.\u201D And I think it\u2019s one of the important observations you make there is that \u2014 and a thing that\u2019s really basic, but hard for us to take in \u2014 is that \u201Cone of the elemental dynamics of self-compassion is to understand our deep reluctance to be left to ourselves.\u201D Yes. That\u2019s right. I\u2019ve often felt the deeper discipline of poetry is overhearing yourself say things you didn\u2019t want to know about the world. And something that actually emancipates you from this smaller self out into this larger dispensation that you actually didn\u2019t think you deserved. And so one of the things we\u2019re most afraid of in silence is this death of the periphery, the outside concerns, the place where you\u2019ve been building your personality, and where you think you\u2019ve been building who you are starts to atomize and fall apart. And it\u2019s one of the basic reasons we find it difficult even just to turn the radio off, or the television, or not look at our gadget \u2014 is that giving over to something that\u2019s going to actually seem as if it\u2019s undermining you to begin with, and lead to your demise. And the intuition, unfortunately, is correct. You are heading toward your demise, but it\u2019s leading towards this richer, deeper place that doesn\u2019t get corroborated very much in our everyday outer world. Would you read the poem \u201CEverything is Waiting for You\u201D? I\u2019ll not only read it, I\u2019ll recite it, actually. I have it in my memory. All right. Excellent. I was just in a room full of many hundred people this morning reciting this very poem. And this piece is written almost like a conversation in the mirror, trying to remind myself what\u2019s first-order. And we have so many allies in this world, including just the color blue in the sky, which we\u2019re not paying attention to, or the breeze, or the ground beneath our feet. And so this is an invitation to come out of abstraction and back into the world again. It\u2019s called \u201CEverything is Waiting for You.\u201D Your great mistake \u2014 Your great mistake is to act the drama as if you were alone. Your great mistake is to act the drama as if you were alone. As if life were a progressive and cunning crime with no witness to the tiny hidden transgressions. To feel abandoned is to deny the intimacy of your surroundings. Surely, even you, at times, have felt the grand array; the swelling presence, and the chorus, crowding out your solo voice You must note the way the soap dish enables you, or the window latch grants you courage. Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity. Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity. The stairs are your mentor of things to come, the doors have always been there to frighten you and invite you, and the tiny speaker in the phone is your dream-ladder to divinity. The tiny speaker in the phone is your dream-ladder to divinity. Put down the weight of your aloneness and ease into the conversation. The kettle is singing even as it pours you a drink, the cooking pots have left their arrogant aloofness and seen the good in you at last. All the birds and creatures of the world are unutterably themselves. Everything, everything, everything is waiting for you. I love that line, \u201CAlertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.\u201D Exactly. Yes. You could take that into a relationship or marriage with good results. \u201CAlertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.\u201D And you make the point, also, that that everything that is waiting includes things that will surprise us in both directions, right? Oh, yes. That that everything also includes your own demise. Exactly. Yeah. Yes, half of every \u2014 of all human experience is mediated through loss and disappearance. And this is one of the reasons why we won\u2019t have the conversation. And we\u2019re \u2026 Because we don\u2019t want to go there. We don\u2019t want to open that\u2026 No, and if you \u2026 \u2026acknowledge that possibility. No. And if you have a really fierce loss, the loss of someone who\u2019s close to you, the loss of a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a friend, God forbid a child \u2014 then human beings have every right to say, \u201CListen, God. If this is how you play the game, I\u2019m not playing the game. I\u2019m not playing by your rules. I\u2019m going to manufacture my own little game, and I\u2019m not going to come out of it. I\u2019m going to make my own little bubble. And I\u2019m going to draw up the rules. And I\u2019m not coming out to this frontier again. I don\u2019t want to. I want to create insulation. I want to create distance.\u201D And many human beings do that for the rest of their lives. Many do it for just a short period and then reemerge again. But all of us are struggling to be here. One of the great theological questions is around incarnation, which simply means being here in your body. Not anywhere else, just here with life\u2019s fierce need to change you. And the fact that the more you\u2019re here and the more you\u2019re alive, the more you realize you\u2019re a mortal human being. And that you\u2019ll pass from this place. And will you actually turn up? Will you actually have the conversation given that it\u2019s so \u2014 will you become a full citizen of vulnerability, loss, and disappearance, which you have no choice about? I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the poet-philosopher David Whyte. I sense all the way through your writing \u2014 in your poetry, in your other writing, you \u2014 I\u2019ll say it this way \u2014 there\u2019s this sadness in you, which is in all \u2014 it\u2019s in all of us, but it\u2019s \u2014 you walk with it as a companion, I think, more openly than we\u2019re taught to do. And perhaps that\u2019s also something that poetry allows. You and I both loved John O\u2019Donohue, and I think\u2026 Yes. \u2026we also both love Rilke. Mm-hmm. And Rilke talks about loving the \u201Cdark hours of his being.\u201D Yes, yes. I just wanted to note that. I appreciate it. And it\u2019s also one of these things about what you bring into the world that is \u2014 I know people recognize it, but it\u2019s also a little bit frightening. Yes. And I describe it more from my own experience as wistfulness and poignancy. A kind of elegiac approach to life. An elegy \u2014 a good elegy, looking at it from the poetic point of view, is always a conversation between grief and celebration. The grief of the loss of the person and the celebration that you were here at all to share the planet with them. And we have that initial shock \u2014 I had that shock, was such a close friend to John O\u2019Donohue, who we\u2019ve mentioned. And he was \u2014 I\u2019m a poet-philosopher, he would\u2019ve been a philosopher-poet. And we were like two bookends. And there was always someone in the world I knew who was travelling and speaking from the same place, although using slightly different language and a slightly different accent, I would say. But when he went, it was like the other half of me disappeared. And we have this physical experience in loss of falling toward something. It\u2019s like falling in love except it\u2019s falling into grief. And you\u2019re falling towards the foundation that they held for you in your life that you didn\u2019t realize they were holding. And you fall and fall and fall and you don\u2019t find it for the longest time. And so the shock of the loss to begin with, and the hermetic sealing off, is necessary in grief. But then there comes a time when you finally actually start to touch the ground that they were holding for you. And it\u2019s from that ground that you step off into your new life. And it\u2019s been a very strange phenomenon in that instance, for instance, of losing John, whereby I\u2019ll start a sentence and feel like John has finished it. Or I\u2019ll hear John speaking, and I\u2019ll start in his voice and finish in my own. And sometimes we\u2019re both talking together, which happened a lot when we were actually together. And so there\u2019s this really astonishing melding that occurs, which is a kind of dreamtime, which human beings start to move into in their maturity, actually, where what is past, what is present, and what\u2019s about to occur are not so clearly marked out. One of the things the Irish say is that \u201Cthe thing about the past is it\u2019s not the past.\u201D It\u2019s right here in this room, in this conversation. That\u2019s absolutely right. And there\u2019s so many different kinds of loss, and across our lifespan. I\u2019m right now just about \u2014 my second child, my son, is about to leave home. Yes. And I love thinking about that \u2014 it\u2019s just kind of sinking in on me. And I love think about that \u2014 what will that mean, for this particular loss, to fall into that foundation of how becoming a mother absolutely transformed me and will still be part of me, but my child will not be at home in that way. This is another delusion we have that we can get \u2014 take a sincere path in life without having our heart broken. And you think about the path of parenting, there\u2019s never been a mother or father since the beginning of time who hasn\u2019t had their heart broken by their children. And nothing traumatic has to happen. All they have to do is grow up. Right. But, usually, there are dramatic things that happen as well anyway. Exactly. Yeah, just in case we were getting bored. I first started hearing about you in the \u201890s, I think, when \u2014 especially this book, The Heart Aroused: Poetry and Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America. Yes. A book I was bullied into writing. What? Oh, you were? Bullied into writing? Well \u2026 Yes, in a good way. Yes. I think, on the surface, most people would say that corporations would be the least poetic spaces in our midst. What you, I think, bring into the open, or help people bring into the open, is the difficult fact that all of this complexity of being human, and all these things we carry, we don\u2019t actually check at the door of our workplaces. I mean, you talk about the drama of work. Yes. Exactly. How did you get into that? And what did you learn there? Well, I\u2019m still in the heart of it. I work with companies and their leadership teams all around the world. But to begin with, all I knew was my bitterly earned experience within non-profit organizations. But I do say, if really want to kill yourself \u2026 Which can also have drama and perhaps more. Yeah. Exactly. Oh my god, no, it\u2019s \u2014 if you really want to kill yourself, the non-profit is the place to go. And if you want machiavellian politics, then a good non-profit, or the English department at the university is exactly the place to go. Yeah. Touch\u00E9. Yeah. And I went full-time as a poet never imagining that I would work in the belly of the beast in the corporate world. I grew up from long lines of rebels in the dispossessed on both my Scots-Yorkshire and on my Irish side. And then I grew up in an area of West Yorkshire which was raving socialist and where the Luddites used to march across the fields to break up the machinery, so my blood inheritance was around disbelief and around skepticism around any large abstract organizations, whether they were government or private. And so when I went full-time as a poet, I was only a year into it and I spoke here in Washington, D.C. at a large psychological conference. And at the end of the conference was this line of people, and at the end of the line was a man who, in best American fashion, said, \u201CWe have to hire you.\u201D And I said in best Anglo-Irish fashion, \u201CFor what?\u201D enthusiastically. And he said, \u201CTo come into corporate America.\u201D And I said, \u201CFor what?\u201D And he said a marvelous thing, actually. He said, \u201CThe language we have in that world is not large enough for the territory that we\u2019ve already entered.\u201D \u201CThe language we have in \u2014 and in your work, I\u2019ve just heard the language that\u2019s large enough for it.\u201D And of course, he was talking about the territory of human relationship that the workplace was entering, and the movable human relationship, and the movability that the organizations had to have. And the only place that came from was from the individuals who actually worked within the structures. So it was the breaking apart of many of those structures. And I don\u2019t think we quite realize how over-structured our organizations were just 25 years ago or 30 years ago. There are still plenty of dinosaur ones left for us to still go and live in if we want them, but \u2026 I think we\u2019ve realized that every once in a while when we engage with an organization that\u2019s still structured that way, that hasn\u2019t managed to change\u2026 Yes. \u2026and you realize how unwieldy and inefficient and ridiculous it is\u2026 Yes. \u2026and bad for us. Yes. And of course, we\u2019ve still got a long way to go. All of our difficulties have now become more subtle and more invisible between us. And so that\u2019s what I work with, around \u2014 whether it\u2019s inside yourself or with the people you\u2019re trying to actually bring together to do things that a single person cannot do alone. And, really, that\u2019s the definition of a corporation. It\u2019s from corpus, Latin, meaning \u201Ca body.\u201D It\u2019s a group of people trying to do something you cannot do if you try to do it by yourself. That\u2019s the only definition. That\u2019s the simplest, core, radical simplicity at the center of every organization. Yeah. You also \u2014 you extend this idea that there\u2019s no self that will survive a real conversation. You say there\u2019s no organization that will keep its original identity if it\u2019s in a conversation. I suppose you also mean a conversation within and without, with the world as well? Yeah. All of us have this inherited conversation inside us which we know is untouchable. It comes from our parents, from our \u2014 the way we\u2019re made, and all the rest of it. But that\u2019s an invisible quality inside you. All the visible qualities that take form and structure will have to change in order to keep the conversation real. Just as we go through the different decades of our life, we have to change the structures of our life in order to keep things new, in order to keep our youthfulness. And I do think there is a quality of youthfulness which is appropriate to every decade of our life. It just looks different. We have this fixed idea of youthfulness from our teens or our 20s. But, actually, there\u2019s a form of youthfulness you\u2019re supposed to inhabit when you\u2019re in your 70s or your 80s or your 90s. It\u2019s this sense of imminent surprise, of imminent revelation, except the revelation and the discovery is more magnified. Fiercer, more to do with your mortality and what you\u2019re going to pass on and leave behind you, the shape of your own absence. There are these lines from \u201CTen Years Later,\u201D your poem: \u201CInnocence is what we allow to be gifted back to us once we\u2019ve given ourselves away.\u201D Yes. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s true that one of the gifts of getting older that is a surprise is that \u2014 is a quality of youthfulness that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with your physical body, but it\u2019s like a recovery of something so lovely. Yes. Exactly. It\u2019s like a deep memory at the same time, and a giving away. Innocence is, in a way, the ability to be found by the world. It\u2019s not a state of naivety. It\u2019s the ability to be found by the world you\u2019re now inhabiting. And part of what we find is we\u2019re just supposed to give ourselves away, actually. I often feel that one of the real signs of maturity is not only understanding that you\u2019re a mortal human being and you are going to die, which usually happens in your mid 40s or 50s \u2014 \u201COh, I am actually going to die. It\u2019s not someone else I\u2019m going to become.\u201D But another step of maturity is actually realizing that the rest of creation might be a little relieved to let you go. That you can stop repeating yourself, stop taking all this oxygen up, and make way for something else which you\u2019ve actually beaten a trail for. And it could be your son, your daughter, could be people you\u2019ve taught or mentored, it could be \u2014 the more generous you are, the more that circle extends into our society and those who go after us. You can listen again and share this conversation with David Whyte through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with David Whyte, the English poet and philosopher, who brings both of those disciplines into the drama of leadership at work as well as deepening in life. All of his work gets at what he calls the \u201Cconversational nature of reality.\u201D I want to talk a little bit more about the corporate sphere just before we move on. So, one thing I\u2019m just really interested in in general \u2014 I\u2019m just interviewing more and more poets. I\u2019m so interested in this question of what poetry works in us. And so I wonder what you have learned about \u2014 how does poetry land in the middle of a workplace and working life? What does it do in us and for us in that context? Well, I always say that poetry is language against which you have no defenses. Otherwise, it\u2019s not poetry. It\u2019s prose. Which is about something. And so poetry is that moment\u2026 I love that. \u2026that moment in a conversation where you have to have the other person understand what you\u2019re saying. And sometimes, it\u2019s when you\u2019re delivering terrible news, news of a death or an accident. And you have to tell the other person, and they have to hear it. And you have to say it in such a way that it\u2019s heard fully. But you have to say it, also, with the intimacy of care and of understanding at the same time. You can also hear it in a marital argument. And you get beautiful echoes and chords and repetitions in marital arguments. Beautiful and terrible. Yes, exactly. That\u2019s right. Yes. But in a good marital argument, when one person has said the truth, both people are emancipated into the next stage of the relationship. Unfortunately, if you are not the person who said it, you have to have a little rear guard action where you deny it. But eventually you have to say, \u201CI wish I\u2019d have said that.\u201D And you\u2019re both actually in this new place. You can turn your face away from what was said, but when you turn your face back, it will still be waiting for you. So that\u2019s the litmus test of poetry. Yeah. So what I\u2019m working with \u2014 I work in three different worlds. One is just as a poet, with the intimacy of my readers and my listeners and audiences. Then I work in the theological and psychological worlds. And at the moment I\u2019ve just come out of a big psychological conference in Washington, D.C. to do this interview. But, really, I work with exactly the same dynamics that we\u2019re all afraid of. First of all, one of the powerful dynamics of leadership is being visible. One of the vulnerabilities of being visible is that when you\u2019re visible, you can be seen. And when you can be seen, you can be touched. And when you can be touched, you can be hurt. So all of us have these elaborate ways of looking as if we\u2019re showing up and not showing up. Except in an organizational setting, it has tremendous consequences on other people\u2019s lives. We\u2019ve all worked in organizations where someone is sitting there at a crossroads or nexus in the organization. They\u2019re there, but they\u2019re not there. And because of that, they\u2019re blocking everything that\u2019s trying to come through their particular portal. So one of the dynamics you have to get over with is this idea that you can occupy a position of responsibility, that you can have a courageous conversation without being vulnerable. So I wrote this little piece in my Consolations book on vulnerability because it\u2019s one of the great primary delusions we have. So, shall I read\u2026 Yes, please. \u2026read a little piece of it? These are supposed to be consolations, but sometimes they\u2019re like blows to the soul. Right. I noticed that. \u201CVulnerability\u201D: \u201CVulnerability is not a weakness, a passing indisposition, or something we can arrange to do without; vulnerability is not a choice, vulnerability is the underlying, ever present, and abiding under-current of our natural state. To run from vulnerability is to run from the essence of our nature; the attempt to be invulnerable is the vain attempt to become something we are not and most especially to close off our understanding of the grief of others. More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability, we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential, tidal and conversational foundations of our identity. \u201CTo have a temporary, isolated sense of power over all events and circumstances is a lovely, illusionary privilege and perhaps the prime and most beautifully constructed conceit of being human and especially of being youthfully human, but it is a privilege that must be surrendered with that same youth, with ill health, with accident, with the loss of loved ones who do not share our untouchable powers, powers eventually and most emphatically given up as we approach our last breath. The only choice we have as we mature is how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we become larger and more courageous and more compassionate through our intimacy with disappearance. Our choice is to inhabit vulnerability as generous citizens of loss, robustly and fully, or conversely, as misers and complainers, reluctant, and fearful, always at the gates of existence, but never bravely and completely attempting to enter, never wanting to risk ourselves, never walking fully through the door.\u201D \u201CVulnerability.\u201D A couple of other words in the Consolations book that I loved. \u201CRest \u2014 \u201D I loved this \u2014 \u201Cis the conversation between what we love to do and how we love to be.\u201D Yes. Sounds like the definition of the perfect Sunday morning. I\u2019m also intrigued by aloneness. We talked about how \u201Calone\u201D is the first word in that book, and there\u2019s a dance that you name and kind of tease out between aloneness and belonging. Yes. Well, there are two different forms of belonging, I suppose. And to have a sense of belonging in the outer world where you feel a sense of freedom comes from this ability to touch this deep foundation of aloneness. And I do feel if you can touch that sense of aloneness, you can live with anyone. There\u2019s a lovely poem \u2014 it\u2019s rather long, \u201CThe House of Belonging.\u201D But these last lines I wrote down. \u201CThis is the bright home in which I live, this is where I ask my friends to come, this is where I want to love all the things it has taken me so long to learn to love. This is the temple of my adult aloneness and I belong to that aloneness as I belong to my life. There is no house like the house of belonging.\u201D Lovely. It\u2019s nice to hear it read back. It\u2019s really wonderful. And again, that juxtaposition of aloneness and belonging, that inextricability. Yes, yes. And I have this poem, actually, which I wrote out of \u2014 when I was in the very intense period out of which that poem \u201CThe House of Belonging\u201D came when I wrote the book called The House of Belonging. And I was writing night and day. But I noticed when I was sat at this lovely little desk, which I still have on a landing at the top of the stairs, I noticed that I had this very different relationship to the world when I wrote at night. There was this other horizon outside the window that was drawing me and that was contextualizing what I was writing. So I wrote this piece. It\u2019s called \u201CSweet Darkness,\u201D and it\u2019s about that same place. Right. Where were you? Where did you write this? On the west coast of the \u2026 I did. I wrote it on Whidbey Island in Langley. In the Puget Sound, north of Seattle. \u201CWhen your eyes are tired the world is tired also. When your vision has gone no part of the world can find you. It\u2019s time to go into the night where the dark has eyes to recognize its own. It\u2019s time to go into the dark where the night has eyes to recognize its own. There you can be sure you are not beyond love. The dark will make a home for you tonight. The night will give you a horizon further than you can see. You must learn one thing. You must learn one thing. The world was made to be free in. You must learn one thing. The world was made to be free in. Give up all the other worlds except the one to which you belong. Sometimes it takes darkness and the sweet confinement of your aloneness to learn anything or anyone that does not bring you alive is too small for you.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the poet-philosopher David Whyte. There\u2019s some lines from this poem \u201CWhat to Remember When Waking.\u201D \u201CTo be human is to become visible while carrying what is hidden as a gift to others.\u201D Yes. What does that mean? Well, it\u2019s really working with that earlier dynamic we worked of of incarnation, of becoming visible in the world. And yet the gift that you\u2019re going to give and keep on giving is an invisible gift that will take many different forms and that you learn more of each time you allow it to take a different form. And you move from your 20s into your 30s, and you suddenly find another, larger form for it, or a different shape that makes a different connection. And then you deepen it in your 40s. And you get overwhelmed by it in your 50s. And then it returns to you again in more mature forms, settled forms, in your 60s. So this is the gift that keeps giving. And it\u2019s that internal deeper source. It\u2019s you becoming more and more real and more and more visible in the world. One other word from Consolations, the book, is \u201Cgenius,\u201D which you describe as something which we already possess. So you\u2019re proposing it as something that\u2019s not just for Albert Einstein, but is accessible to the rest of us. Yeah. And you say, \u201CHuman genius lies in the geography of the body and its conversation with the world.\u201D There\u2019s your \u201Cconversation\u201D again. Yes. \u201CThe meeting between inheritance and horizon.\u201D So help me understand that. Yes. Well, in the ancient world, the word \u201Cgenius\u201D was not so much used about individual people, it was used about places, and almost always with the world loci. Genius loci meant \u201Cthe spirit of a place.\u201D And we all know what that intuitively means. We all have favorite places in the world, and it may be a seashore where you\u2019ve got this ancient conversation between the ocean and the land and a particular geography of the way the cliffs or the beaches are formed. But it could\u2019ve been the same in the ancient world. A little bridge crossing a stream with a pool at the back of it and a willow hanging over the pool \u2014 that place would be said to have a genius loci. But a more sophisticated understanding would understand it\u2019s this weatherfront of all of these qualities that meet in that place. So I think it\u2019s a very merciful thing to think of human beings in the same way as \u2014 that is, your genius is just the way everything has met in you. And it\u2019s your job just \u2026 Physically as well as \u2026 Exactly. Literally, all the struggles of your grandparents and your parents in arriving together and giving birth to your parents and giving birth to you, the landscape in which you were nurtured, the dialect or language in which you were educated into the world, the smells of the local environment. When I go back to Yorkshire, just the taste of the water off the moors is completely different. When I go to County Clare, the water there, again, has a spirit, because it comes off limestone there. So it\u2019s really merciful, actually, not to think of genius as something that I\u2019m going to get to by hard work \u2014 if I practice the violin 15 hours a day. It\u2019s the innate gift that makes me want to practice the violin, actually. It\u2019s the way everything meets inside me. Will I have that conversation? And this is the experience of consummation, of a full incarnation in the world. You know, I had the same conversation with John O\u2019Donohue that I\u2019m going to have with you now, which is the beauty of that thought. And the reality that geography, for many people, at any given time, is so harsh, and living with that reality of our global body as well, the puzzle of it. Yes. Yes, that\u2019s right. And there are many people in Syria now just trying to preserve their lives and the lives of their loved ones. So this has always been there and always been true. And who knows? Any of us could be precipitated into awful circumstances at any time. And many of us go through those dark years where you just feel as if it\u2019s just the movement of your own \u2014 your own movement that\u2019s just creating body heat to actually keep you alive. We go through those very, very narrow places. And John used to talk about how you shaped a more beautiful mind, and that it\u2019s an actual discipline, no matter what circumstances you\u2019re in. The way I interpreted it was the discipline of asking beautiful questions, and that a beautiful question shapes a beautiful mind. And so the ability to ask beautiful questions, often in very unbeautiful moments, is one of the great disciplines of a human life. And a beautiful question starts to shape your identity as much by asking it as it does by having it answered. And you don\u2019t have to do anything about it. You just have to keep asking. And before you know it, you will find yourself actually shaping a different life, meeting different people, finding conversations that are leading you in those directions that you wouldn\u2019t even have seen before. That\u2019s what Rilke called \u201Cliving the question.\u201D Exactly. Yeah. He\u2019s always there before you. Yes. He is. Also, one way I\u2019ve come to think about the power of questions is that questions elicit answers in their likeness. Mm. Yes. So you call forth something beautiful by asking a beautiful question. Yes, you do. Yeah, you do. And then the other part of it, too, is that there\u2019s this weighted silence behind each question. And to live with that sense of trepidation \u2014 what I call beautiful trepidation \u2014 the sense of something about to happen that you\u2019ve wanted, but that you\u2019re scared to death of actually happening. None of us really feel we deserve our happiness. I want to ask you, before we hear some more poetry, this ancient, animating question. What does it mean to be human? That\u2019s something that you have reflected on with language and in thought all across your life. But how you would begin to answer that question now, and what do you keep on learning? What are you learning anew at this moment in your life about what it means to be human? Well, one of the interesting qualities of being human is, by the look of it, we\u2019re the only part of creation that can actually refuse be to be ourselves. And as far as I can see, there\u2019s no other part of the world that can do that. The cloud is the cloud, the mountain is the mountain, the tree is the tree, the hawk is the hawk. The kingfisher doesn\u2019t wake up one day and say, \u201CYou know, God, I\u2019m absolutely fed up to the back teeth of this whole kingfisher trip. Can I have a day as a crow? You know, hang out with my mates, glide down for a bit of carrion now and again? That\u2019s the life for \u2014 \u201D No. The kingfisher is just the kingfisher. And one of the healing things about the natural world to human beings is that it\u2019s just itself. But we, as human beings, are really quite extraordinary in that we can actually refuse to be ourselves. We can get afraid of the way we are. And we can temporarily put a mask over our face and pretend to be somebody else or something else. And the interesting thing is then we can take it another step of virtuosity and forget that we were pretending to be someone else and become the person we were, on the surface, at least, who we were just pretending to be in the first place. So one of the astonishing qualities of being human is the measure of our reluctance to be here, actually. And I think one of the great necessities of self knowledge is understanding and even tasting the single-malt essence of your own reluctance to be here. All the ways you don\u2019t want to have the conversation, all the ways you don\u2019t want to be in the marriage, you don\u2019t want to be a parent, you don\u2019t want to be visible in a leadership position, you don\u2019t want to be doing this work. And this is not to give it away. This is just to understand what lies between you and a sense of freedom in it. And I think self-compassion has to do with this ability to understand, and even to cultivate a sense of humor about all the ways you just don\u2019t want to be here. That is the Woody Allen comic routine in the world. It\u2019s all the hypochondriac ways he\u2019s afraid of the world. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s so entertaining, because we all recognize that part of us. So to embody your reluctance, and therefore, once it\u2019s embodied, to allow it to actually start to change into something else, to \u2014 things only solidify when they\u2019re kept at a distance. As soon as they\u2019re embodied, they actually start to take on a kind of seasonality. And you\u2019re actually, by embodying it, by feeling it fully, allowing it to start to change into something else. Would you maybe also just read one more? Read \u201CWorking Together\u201D? \u201CWorking Together.\u201D Yeah. Yes. Do you have that there? I have that in my memory, actually. Oh, you do. OK. \u201CWe shape our selves to fit this world \u2014 \u201D \u201CWorking Together\u201D: \u201CWe shape ourselves to fit this world and by the world are shaped again. The visible and the invisible working together in common cause, to produce the miraculous. I am thinking of the way the invisible air traveled at speed round a shaped wing easily holds our weight. I am thinking of the way the invisible air traveled at speed round a shaped wing easily holds our weight. So may we, in this life trust to those elements we have yet to see or imagine, and find the true shape of our own self, by forming it well to the great intangibles about us. and find the true shape the true shape of our own self, by forming it well to the great intangibles about us.\u201D David Whyte is an Associate Fellow at Sa\u00EFd Business School at the University of Oxford.
