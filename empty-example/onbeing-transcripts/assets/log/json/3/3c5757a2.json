  "fullText": "Sherry Turkle founded and directs the intriguingly titled MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. She made waves with her book Alone Together; it was widely reviewed as a call to \u201Cunplug\u201D our digital gadgets. But as I\u2019ve read her and listened to her speak, I hear Sherry Turkle saying something more thought-provoking: that we can lead examined lives with our technology. That each of us, in our everyday interactions, can choose between letting technology shape us and shaping it towards human purposes, even towards honoring what we hold dear. Engaging Sherry Turkle on this is full of usable ideas \u2014 from how to declare email bankruptcy to teaching our children the rewards of solitude \u2014 a core human experience more elusive for their generation. And in technology as in life, it seems, discontent can be the beginning of wisdom. : I\u2019m optimistic because the people who I interviewed sense that there\u2019s something amiss. There are a lot of people out there who \u2014 they love their phones, they love their music, they love listening to their books on their MP3 players, as do I. But there\u2019s something about this that has just tipped out of balance and they want to get it right. Reflecting on our technology. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Beingfrom APM, American Public Media. Sherry Turkle is Abby Rockefeller Mauz\u00E9 Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT. Her interest, as she puts it, is in the subjective side of technology \u2014 how it affects our attention and relationships, our sense of reality and even of aliveness. I interviewed Sherry Turkle in 2011. One of her early books, published in the Orwellian year of 1984, celebrated the potential synergy of computers, selfhood, and the human spirit. That was followed by other writing on \u201Cidentity\u201D in the age of the Internet and \u201CSimulation and Its Discontents.\u201D Sherry Turkle has studied human interaction with new generations of sociable robots that she says could redefine sentience and companionship. But she\u2019s also done extensive, qualitative research with children and adults on the inner effects of the laptops and tablets, the phones and players that have already transformed the substance of our days. I\u2019m utterly intrigued just by the way you describe your passion, your interest and concern, that you study the subjective side of our encounters with technologies, that I\u2019m concerned with the human meaning of the objects of our lives. And just as we start, I wanted to ask you a kind of question I ask everyone, which is, you know, was there a spiritual background to your childhood? And what I wonder as I read those kinds of statements that you make about what interests you, you know, was there a spiritual background to your childhood that seeded this kind of concern about human meaning? Well, I think in my case the question didn\u2019t come from a spiritual quest; it came from a deeply personal psychological quest. My father \u2014 my biological father disappeared from my life when I was around two. My mother, my grandparents, my mother\u2019s sister, my aunt, didn\u2019t want me to know anything about him. And so, of course, I only wanted to know things about him and would search through, you know, every family \u2014 we lived in very close quarters in an apartment in Brooklyn, you know, where five adults were squeezed into a one-bedroom apartment. But there were these places: there was a closet that had old books and trinkets and there was a junk drawer. There were just these places where the memories were kept. I would scour them for traces of him and finally I found one. I found a photograph of him in which someone in anger had rubbed out his face, but I found all kinds of information from that photograph, you know, that he wore tweed pants, where he was standing, what his shoes \u2014 you know, his lace-up shoes looked like. And I just think that some place in that quest of a child, the notion of looking for objects to fill in human meaning became very close to my heart in a very personal way. You know, obviously, as I became a sociologist, you know, there\u2019s a fancy word for studying this; it\u2019s called bricolage. It\u2019s the science of studying meanings and the interplay of objects, and I realized that that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019d been doing all the time. A little bit like Moli\u00E8re\u2019s, you know, Monsieur Jourdain who\u2019d been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, I\u2019d been a bricoleur all my life without knowing it. So is this kind of a lifelong question of yours about where memories are kept and how we make sense of the objects and how objects, I think you\u2019ve said this, lead us to ourselves and lead our way through a world? Is part of what you\u2019re doing trying to figure out, you know, our technological devices, new objects? I mean, what do they take away? How do they lend themselves to this kind of bricolage? Oh, absolutely. They are objects. It remains to be seen the degree to which we will let them take away because they also give. I mean, technological objects have become almost phantom limbs. They are so much part of us. Right. Right. I mean, seriously, there\u2019s a phenomenon where people feel their phones ringing and they\u2019re not. It\u2019s called the phantom ring. Teenagers report that even when they put their cell phones in their lockers, you know, as schools require them to do, they know when their phones are ringing. Oh, my gosh. So I came up with the notion of the phantom limb . We\u2019re very close to our phones. So, you know, it\u2019s absolutely fascinating to read that when you started at MIT, you say you met the idea that part of your job would be to think of ways to keep technology busy. Yes. That alone tells us how little we understood in the beginning and how radically, not just our lives, but our imaginations about this stuff have changed. Yeah, I mean, there was a meeting that was held for the computer science faculty and I was already studying people and computers, so I was invited. Was this the early \u201980s when we\u2019re talking? This was the late \u201970s, \u201978. I think the meeting might have been \u201978 or perhaps the beginning of \u201979. The greatest computer scientists in the world were invited to \u2014 the great names: Licklider, Fano, Pappert, Dertouzos \u2014 legendary figures to try to come up with things regular people \u2014 they called them regular people \u2014 might want to do, and they called them home computers. The term personal computers really hadn\u2019t yet entered the lexicon. Right. What I remember when I looked at my notes for that meeting was somebody said a calendar; people put their calendars on computers and people said that\u2019s crazy because really a little flip book is fabulous for that. You see it all; you flip back and forth; you erase. Why do you want that on a computer? Somebody said, well, names and addresses. I remember there was a similar reaction \u2014 and these were very sophisticated people that really, unless you had a database, really paper was good. Right. It raises the question of was he right. But you know, I love this story because \u2014 and then everybody agreed that people would want to play games. OK. So there would be games. But I love this story because I like to say that it turned out that, when we were connected to each other on the network, you know, it wasn\u2019t that we would need to worry about how we would keep the computers busy. They keep us busy because we\u2019re their killer app, we\u2019re their killer app. We want to be tweeting and texting and Facebooking and being connected to each other all the time. We can\u2019t get enough of using them to be with each other. But it also shows how recently we really didn\u2019t know what this technology was for and it\u2019s humbling because, um, you know, really my favorite line in Alone Together, if an author is allowed to have a favorite line is \u2026 You are here. I\u2019m allowed. Really, my favorite line is, \u201CJust because we grew up with the Internet, we think that the Internet is all grown up.\u201D That is that we think, that we have a mature Internet in front of us and we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t have a mature Internet in front of us. We\u2019re in the baby stages, and that\u2019s good because that means we can make it right. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today I\u2019m with Sherry Turkle, an author and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. We\u2019re reflecting on the inner effects of the digital objects of our lives. We are at the beginning of a kind of revolution, something that is changing us in ways that are unfolding in real time. I mean, we often feel like it\u2019s just hard to keep up, and it is hard to keep up. I wonder if we in the 21st century are better equipped to be at a moment like this where we can actually \u2014 where we also somehow have the capacity and the intelligence \u2014 we have this capacity, whether we use it or not \u2014 to stop and say, \u201CAll right, let\u2019s make this work for human beings.\u201D I mean, that\u2019s what you\u2019re proposing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m proposing, and I get very discouraged whenever I see any signs \u2014 and I\u2019ve got to say I see many signs \u2014 that we don\u2019t seem to have a taste for stopping and asking, well, how can we make this work for us? So I\u2019ll give you an example of, you know, kind of my most recent moment of when I get nervous. Mark Zuckerberg makes a statement that \u201Cprivacy is no longer relevant as an element in social discourse.\u201D He says that. It gets widely reported, not commented on, as though this is like a serious pronouncement. I mean, it\u2019s very serious when Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, says that. An announcement that one doesn\u2019t have to question, I guess. Right. Doesn\u2019t question. You know, I tweet very little , but this caused me to tweet. I said very simply, you know, maybe privacy isn\u2019t convenient for the social network, but maybe we should be asking \u2014 and I did get in under 140 characters \u2014 you know, what is intimacy without privacy, what is democracy without privacy? Right. Democracy and privacy are very linked together in the modern world. So I get concerned when we don\u2019t seem to be stepping up to it. Mm-hmm. And another one of these examples that\u2019s even more existential is your sense of how technology is changing our sense of aliveness. I mean, you\u2019ve often told this story, and I wonder if you\u2019d tell it again, of taking your daughter to the Darwin exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. I remember that exhibit. It seems to be a pivotal story for you. Well, it is a pivotal story. It\u2019s a pivotal story because this is an example of the prepared mind finds it a pivotal story. I\u2019ve been studying children and how they see the computer as alive since the late 1970s so \u2026 And you also have worked with robotic pets and \u2026 Yes. I mean, I have \u2014 I have exposed children \u2014 so I\u2019m very interested in the question of \u2014 you know, when Piaget \u2014 the great \u2014 the great psychologist Piaget was interested in the question of how do children decide what\u2019s alive and not alive. And he \u2014 in the world of traditional objects where you had bicycles and stones and dolls, he interviewed children about what was alive and not alive. Ultimately, they decided that things that could move, physically move without an outside push or pull, were alive. So that meant that, for example, they would incorrectly classify clouds as alive until they could figure out that the wind pushed the clouds. When the computer came, I studied a radical shift in how children went about solving that problem because they no longer cared \u2014 and this was dramatic \u2014 they no longer cared about whether or not something was pushed in terms of its movement. They cared about how this thing thought, what its psychology was, whether its psychology came from the inside, and that was stunning. That was stunning to watch. By the time of the Darwin exhibit in 2006, I think, my daughter saw a Gal\u00E1pagos turtle, which had been brought up from the islands. This was the life that Darwin saw. She looks at this turtle \u2014 and she\u2019s been exposed to robots, you know, ever since she\u2019s been a baby, the Tamagotchis, the Furbies, the AIBOs. She looks at me and she says, because this turtle is sleeping, she says, \u201CFor what this turtle is doing, they could have just had a robot.\u201D It struck me that, from her point of view, the fact that it was alive mattered not at all. And I begin to interview \u2014 and actually went back to the museum several times and begin to interview kids and parents about the question of the turtles because the kids began to use a locution phrase to talk about the turtles, and the phrase they used was \u201Ca robot would have been alive enough,\u201D which was a phrase that by that time I\u2019d been at this study over 20 years and I\u2019d never heard that. That\u2019s when I started talking about a new pragmatism among this generation of young people. This is no longer philosophical. Life becomes a pragmatic quality. Is this alive enough for this purpose? And this is important because we\u2019re now talking about robots that will serve as companions to the elderly, robots that will serve as companions to children as kind of nanny-bots. This is the question being asked of them. Are they alive enough for this purpose? And I, of course, think this is the wrong question in many cases and that moment at the museum helped me frame, you know, helped me frame my thinking. So, you know, I was struck when I was reading one of your accounts of this, of what a parent said, so the kids would say, \u201CDid it have to be alive for this?\u201D and a father I remember you saying, \u201CIt\u2019s real. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201D And that point was lost on the child. What question do you wish the children were asking or how do you wish they were framing that observation? Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of a wish. I think it\u2019s really not for us to be wishing, but to be noting. My way of approaching this is to begin to say, \u201CWhat are the things these children start to miss if they don\u2019t think it\u2019s important that things be alive?\u201D And so what do you think of? What do they start to miss? Well, for example \u2014 for example when people just plug their earphones in. I live on the Cape during the summer, and there are these magnificent dunes that I walk on the Cape. When you walk these dunes \u2014 and I\u2019ve been walking them for years, I mean, decades of going to the Cape. And recently, people have their earphones in and are listening to their music. And more recently, people have their earphones in and are walking them with their handheld devices and are texting as they walk them. Right. So you\u2019re still getting your exercise. And I\u2019m not saying that they\u2019re not looking up to, you know, notice anything. I mean, it\u2019s not for me to judge that nobody\u2019s noticing anything. But there\u2019s something about being attentive with the life you meet along those walks and with solitude. Right. So you\u2019re losing the experience of the dunes as a medium for self-realization, for example. I mean, I think that image of the dunes \u2014 I think that this idea of solitude is so central and so powerful in your writing, and we don\u2019t think about this very often. You know, this basic quality of human health and wholeness that comes with being able to feel at peace in your own company, right, as somebody said? Yeah. There\u2019s a wonderful phrase. In psychology, it says, \u201CIf you don\u2019t teach your children to be alone, they\u2019ll only always know how to be lonely.\u201D It\u2019s not just your children. I mean, if you don\u2019t know \u2026 Right. \u2026 how to be alone, you\u2019ll only always know how to be lonely. If you\u2019re always reaching for the device, the cell, the Facebook, the sharing, um, you lose that. I\u2019m very concerned about this. Mm-hmm. The other thing that I\u2019m aware of with my children \u2014 so I\u2019ll say I have a 12-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, so I\u2019m in the middle of this. You know, if you think about kind of basic spiritual principles, I mean, technology is the ultimate anti \u201Cbeing in the present moment\u201D temptation. I mean, I have this experience with my kids, and they\u2019re not overly \u2014 they\u2019re not wildly involved with their technology, I think, compared to some other kids. But I\u2019ll say to my daughter when we\u2019re driving in the car \u2014 we used to be just be driving in the car and talking, right, even just a couple of years ago before everybody had phones \u2014 I\u2019ll just say, \u201CI want you to be with me.\u201D And she thinks she is, but she doesn\u2019t even realize that she\u2019s not. And it\u2019s true of a lot of experiences, that they\u2019re not \u2014 as you say, they\u2019re not \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing, walking in the dunes. Oh, I have a 19-year-old daughter. A very wise, wonderful friend, Jill Ker Conway, who is a friend and mentor of mine \u2026 And the former president of Smith. Former president of Smith, a great writer, a great memoirist, said to me once, apropos of raising a daughter, she said, \u201CA child has to live in her generation.\u201D Yeah. And I\u2019ve tried to use these wise words from Jill Ker Conway to get me through, you know, moments of doubt. So I kind of know that really it\u2019s not my place, you know, to be reminding Rebecca about my needs because, you know, it\u2019s natural for her to text her friends that she\u2019s on her way home, right? Mm-hmm. I mean \u2014 but there is a loss, there is a loss, because I remember the conversations that we used to have. In the car? In the car. Yeah, so I\u2019m with you on that and yet I also think it\u2019s like solitude. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t \u2014 it would be crazy for me to impose some \u201Cno cell phones in the car\u201D rule, right? Absolutely. I mean, I think I\u2019m trying to ban them from the dinner table. That\u2019s the Jill Ker Conway dilemma, although I do think the dinner table is different. I do too, I do too. I do believe in this notion of sacred spaces. But it\u2019s a struggle. It is a struggle, but I believe that there are some places that, in the car, you know, it\u2019s reasonable to say, \u201CHey, I\u2019m going back to my friends. I want to tell them I\u2019m coming.\u201D You know, every place you are with your children, you can\u2019t say is a sacred space . That doesn\u2019t fly. But I think that, for families as they grow up, I do feel strongly about this because really this dinner table thing has been such a theme in my research, such a theme as teenagers look back on their lives and what they miss. It\u2019s teenagers who say, \u201CMy parents text at the dinner table.\u201D Right . Right. There\u2019s a story in my book: This young man has a mother who is a gourmet cook. So her pleasure is in making these long, long, many-course meals and that\u2019s how she shows her love for her family. And she\u2019s married to a kind of master of the universe, kind of Wall Street-type guy, and he\u2019s on his BlackBerry all through dinner. And their son starts to try to negotiate with the mother: Could she prepare shorter meals so that then maybe the father would put away the BlackBerry? But he\u2019s not going to do it if it\u2019s a four-course meal. But maybe he would do it if it was basically just soup and salad, or maybe he would do it if it was just salad and a grilled steak. You know, you see a teenager trying to negotiate some way to get this BlackBerry out of the dinner table, and it\u2019s touching. Are you finding ways to live more deliberately with technology \u2014 to shape it to honor what really matters? Share that with us and other listeners at onbeing.org. There you can also, as always, listen again or find links to download this program as well as my unedited interview with Sherry Turkle. For example, she told me much more about her work with sociable robots \u2014 which she says are on the cusp of reframing our sense of responsibility to other human beings. Again, that\u2019s all at onbeing.org. Coming up, more on how creating boundaries with technology can teach and nourish our children; also, strategies for growing up in our relationship with email. I\u2019ve known a lot of people who declare email bankruptcy. You basically say: There are 10,000 messages in my inbox; yours is one of them. If you have continuing business with me, please send me another email. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, reflecting on our technology with Sherry Turkle. She\u2019s a sociologist, psychologist, and director of the Initiative on Technology and Self at MIT. She studies and writes about the \u201Csubjective side\u201D of technology \u2014 the inner effects of the digital objects of our lives. You do use this phrase \u201Csacred spaces.\u201D One moment of insight that I had about technology was when I was talking to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Do you know him? No. He\u2019s a scientist, but he\u2019s worked on bringing meditation into medicine. He made this really simple observation that technology goes 24/7, but we don\u2019t. I mean, biologically, physiologically, we can\u2019t. It\u2019s this boundarylessness. I mean, this gets back to your point that it\u2019s not just a matter of choices. At some point, it\u2019s a matter of survival; we have to set boundaries. When you talk about sacred spaces, what are you talking about there? To make our life livable, we have to have spaces where we are fully present to each other or to ourselves, where we\u2019re not competing with the roar of the Internet and, quite frankly, where the people around us are not competing with the latest news off the Facebook status update. They may not have anything new. They may just be there being in a way that needs attention. I mean, people like to put things on Facebook and certainly Twitter that are happy. I\u2019ve interviewed people who say things to me as simple as, you know, I don\u2019t even like to put that my dog died. Really? Yeah, because it doesn\u2019t seem the place. It doesn\u2019t seem the place for a lot of people to share negative things. Anyway, I guess I\u2019m saying that sacred space is for me the places in your daily life where you want to keep them for yourself and the people who you need to give full attention to. I have very simple rules. I mean, so far as I have rules for how to know you\u2019re close to one or in one or should be having one: It\u2019s dinner, it\u2019s sharing meals with your family, it\u2019s that moment at school pickup when your kid looks up and is trying to meet your eye. You know, you\u2019re looking down at your smartphone and your child is trying to meet your eye. I have enough data from children who\u2019re going through this experience to know that it\u2019s a terrible moment for them. It\u2019s on the playground. Very bad when your child\u2019s on the jungle gym and is desperately trying to have you look at them, for them to be taking hands off the jungle gym to try to get your attention \u2014 accident time. I mean, be in the park. Be in the park with them. Spend less time there, but make it a space. Make it a moment. These are important moments. It\u2019s so interesting that you\u2019re talking as much as or more about adults not setting boundaries with this, right? I mean \u2026 Oh, absolutely. Well, this is data-driven. I mean, this is data-driven in the sense that this is one of the surprises to me in doing the research. Is that I thought when I started this research that I was going to be telling a story of children driving their parents crazy. Yeah. And I\u2019m not. It ended up that it was a story of parents \u2014 as much a story of parents leaving their children feeling lonely and alone and modeling the very behavior that then they came to find irritating in their children. Yes, right. I mean, how can we \u2014 we talked a minute ago about somehow carving out in your child\u2019s life an experience of solitude so that they know how to be alone, and this idea of being present, but if we ourselves are not modeling those possibilities. Absolutely. I mean, I think the greatest gift you can give your child is to walk out of the house without your phone. I mean, to pick up the newspaper, to pick up the bagel, to go out for coffee. Don\u2019t take your phone. Show your child what that looks like, that you\u2019re willing to step out of the house not open for communication. In the place on the Cape I live in Provincetown, there\u2019re these beautiful mudflats that, again, are one of nature\u2019s wonders. And people now walk them with their kids and their phones, and that\u2019s a very powerful message to a child that we\u2019re walking them with our phones. You know, I\u2019m not like a romantic or I don\u2019t have like a crazy nostalgia for, you know, an unplugged life, you know, in cabins in the woods, not at all. I\u2019m just saying that we have to ask ourselves really what is served by having an always-on, always-on you, open-to-anyone-who-wants-to-reach-us way of life? Because in my research, I\u2019ve found that it actually cuts off conversations as much as it opens out conversations. So, for example, you can be too busy communicating to think, well, to think. Mm-hmm. You know, there\u2019s this wonderful line from Barbara Tuchman. Somebody said to this great \u2014 you know great writer and very prolific writer. Somebody said, \u201CWell, how do you write a book?\u201D She said, \u201CWell, first you have to have an idea.\u201D You know it was like \u2014 like sort of step one, have an idea. I mean, you have to be able to think. Right, and that, again, comes back to solitude and attentiveness. Absolutely. You know, there\u2019s something \u2014 when I wake up in the morning \u2014 I mean, the way I\u2019ve handled it is I do set aside three times a day when I\u2019m doing my email. It\u2019s a lot of email; it\u2019s a lot of time. But I prefer it because, in the other times of my day, I\u2019m thinking. You\u2019re not checking all the time. I\u2019m not reactive because there are two ways of being. I mean, when you\u2019re emailing, you\u2019re reactive. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s not your independent thoughts. It\u2019s your reactive to other peoples\u2019 possibilities, other peoples\u2019 plans, other peoples\u2019 input, other peoples\u2019 ideas. And there\u2019s just something about being completely in your own head with your own thoughts that\u2019s very valuable. One of the things that was actually helpful for me as I started hearing you out there talking about your book was you talked about research and the stress that comes with technology. This is something else I don\u2019t think we\u2019re self-aware about. I also think it probably varies very much from person to person, right? I have a level of anxiety with \u2014 I mean, I am actually obsessive about keeping on top of my email. I cannot bear it for my inbox to get too big and I haven\u2019t solved it. But at the same time, I am physically aware of how my stress level rises with technology. I can\u2019t do Facebook. It makes me nervous. Are there other people like me out there? Oh, absolutely. And, actually, your email is making you nervous and you\u2019re going to probably extreme lengths to deal with that anxiety by spending a great deal of time attending to it so that it won\u2019t make you too anxious to function, to managing it. I mean, I say I do my email three times a day. That\u2019s a lot of hours because I think we\u2019re probably quite similar. You know, I can get 600 or 700 a day. Those people \u2014 you know, I will confess to your listeners \u2014 those 700 messages, those people really don\u2019t need to write me. You know, they want to. These are just people who have access to me because I have a public email and who have something to say to me and this is how the system works now. They don\u2019t all need to write to you and you don\u2019t need to feel beholden. Guilty. Right, but that\u2019s a hard thing. So this is making me think. I recently had a conversation with Anthony Appiah, who I think you\u2019ve quoted, a philosopher. He talked about one of the things that technology has done is it\u2019s taken away the role of the editor. I mean, he was talking about how we send our opinions out into the world now and that there used to be this editorial function which meant a pause and it meant thinking and it meant that there wasn\u2019t so much raw emotion that things got edited. Now, I\u2019m thinking about what you said at the beginning that we\u2019re in the baby, we\u2019re in the infancy stages of this technology. I\u2019m wondering if part of this move that you are advocating, of us becoming self-aware about using \u2014 shaping technology to serve human purposes, is that we hopefully gradually will become our own editors in terms of we won\u2019t necessarily write that nonessential email or answer that nonessential email. Is that part of the process we\u2019re in? Absolutely, absolutely. We\u2019re in between worlds now. I still treat email to me as though it were considered correspondence. And I feel as though I have a responsibility to answer my correspondence. But I think that as we become more sophisticated, we\u2019ll adopt a more humane set of rules, where we will adapt better to \u2014 well, first of all, one thing we\u2019ll do is that people won\u2019t expect instant answers. I don\u2019t know how it is for you, but if I don\u2019t respond to an email really within a few hours, people get angry at me. They\u2019ll say things like, \u201CDon\u2019t you read your email?\u201D I wonder if, as this happens, as we take a more proactive stance in shaping technology, being deliberate about it and, as you say, shaping technology to honor what we hold dear, you must see people taking different approaches to this. I\u2019m curious about whether adults and young people will do it in different ways and if there may be some tensions we have to hold even in our different solutions to this. Well, I think that younger people have more options because they\u2019re not yet in the work world. OK. So young people will talk about, \u201CI\u2019m taking a holiday from Facebook\u201D and go off for the summer and get out of the whole Facebook scene, where they feel a lot of pressure to maintain the profile. Because there is some very I think hilarious, I mean, I think my book is so funny, but I really know the author . I mean, I read sections of this book that crack me up. These teenagers describing how, you know, they try to keep up their profiles, they make themselves thinner. But then the stress of keeping up the profile just right, you know, you don\u2019t want to do this, you don\u2019t want to do that, you know, you don\u2019t want to show you care too much, but you don\u2019t want it to be too nonchalant because you don\u2019t want to be like some kind of slacker. Oh, it\u2019s just a lot of work. I\u2019m interviewing one guy and, at some point, he\u2019s talking about all the work this is. He looks up at me and says, \u201CI wonder how long I have to keep doing this?\u201D It\u2019s so clear to him that \u2026 There\u2019s a world-weariness. Yes. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t possibly imagine that is like how long, how long? So, I mean, they just get exhausted. You know, they have to do this and their homework? I mean, it\u2019s just like one more thing. And get into college? So they\u2019ll drop out of Facebook because that\u2019s just a whole other project. Adults really can\u2019t, if they have jobs, just say, \u201CI\u2019m unplugging,\u201D since so many of us have jobs where the plugging in is really the main way we\u2019re with each other. Well, you know, I did declare an email sabbatical for two months last summer. Really? How\u2019d that go? Well, my out-of-office bounce said, \u201CI\u2019m taking an email sabbatical. If it\u2019s urgent, you can call this number.\u201D It went fine, you know. It went fine. I came back and it all started all over again, but the world went on. Well, I\u2019ve known a lot of people who declare email bankruptcy where you basically say, \u201CThere are 5,000\u201D \u2014 make up a number \u2014 \u201CThere are 10,000 \u2026 In your inbox? Yes. \u201CThere are 10,000 messages in my inbox; yours is one of them\u201D \u2014 a little program goes through \u2014 \u201Cand I am not going to be going through these messages. If you have continuing business with me, please send me another email. If not, I\u2019m not going to be returning to your earlier request. I will just be considering that transaction, you know, archived.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, we\u2019re reflecting on our lives with technology with Sherry Turkle. I interviewed her in 2011. She created and directs the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, and she\u2019s the author of Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other. So I do want to talk to you about, though, again in this same infancy stage, I see interesting paradoxes emerging. We did a public forum on civil discourse after the Tucson shootings. Mm-hmm. We had this interesting experience that in the room, which we could have laid out differently, but it was about 100 people and they\u2019re all looking straight ahead and they\u2019re looking at me and it doesn\u2019t end up being a conversation. It ended up being a presentation and a back-and-forth between me and other people, and they didn\u2019t interact with each other. Online \u2014 in this online space, there was incredible interaction going on, people sprouting ideas right and left about action steps and what they would do next. You know, truly reacting to each other and learning. I love that. All kinds of cross channels and back channels. Right. That\u2019s great, you know, but knowing how to do that and getting good at doing that, this is the art and science of 21st-century communication arts and sciences. It needs to be nurtured and developed, and I think that\u2019s the problem that we\u2019ve had in education where, you know, you set up the ability for people to have WiFi in classrooms, you put them in big lecture halls, and they shop . You know, I mean, was it just because we put them on WiFi that we thought they were going to be setting up exciting fora in which they would be bringing things to a higher level? One university after another is rethinking this and, as I go around the country, you know, we talk about it, we laugh about it because everyone who\u2019s a professor today pretty much, you know, a senior faculty were there when this was set up and we remember what was on our minds and now we stand in the back of those classrooms and watch our students, you know, ordering from REI Sports and Amazon and on Facebook and on J. Crew. You know, we didn\u2019t give it enough thought, so that\u2019s what I mean. So that\u2019s part of the growing up. Just this is part of growing up. Just because we grew up with the Internet, we think the Internet is all grown up and it\u2019s not. You know, one of the things that your work and reading you made me think about is, in this growing-up process and this process of change, is a natural space for grieving also or what we\u2019re losing or maybe that\u2019s part of also wondering what\u2019s amiss and addressing it. You know, when you talked about growing up and your whole world opening up because of books that you found on a bookshelf and they took you someplace that your family wouldn\u2019t have taken you or those objects you stumbled upon, then I wonder will children in the future stumble on life-changing books on somebody else\u2019s Kindle? Is part of this process also saying what are we losing and some of it not being able to get back or even wanting to get back, but just noticing the loss? I don\u2019t know. Well, I think that one of the things that fascinates me now is the question of legacies. Well, what did you say? Where are memories kept? That\u2019s a big question with all this technology. Well, that\u2019s a big question in my book is where are memories kept. This is of great concern to me because now today\u2019s memory closet is locked in somebody\u2019s hard drive and it\u2019s also not tactile. It\u2019s also not \u2026 It can\u2019t be put in a box put in the basement. It can\u2019t be put in a box. Actually, this is very serious. I have my daughter\u2019s now going to be 20 and I would say I have 14 years of her life in boxes and in printed photographs, scrapbooks beautifully made, lovingly assembled. Then she started taking the pictures. They were digital. And then she got the iPhone. There was never a print again, and it just \u2014 we went into a different phase where we\u2019ve got it on the computers. I recently started \u2014 so my kids went to Scotland with their dad; their grandmother lives there. It was a big trip and they wrote me these really hilarious and insightful emails and, for the first time, I printed out those emails and put them in boxes. I mean, it doesn\u2019t come naturally. Good for you. I thought, look, I want them to read these emails about their trip to Scotland. But you\u2019re right. If it had been a letter, it just would automatically have been filed away someplace tactile. Good for you. I end Alone Together with a story of my daughter\u2019s \u2014 she spent her gap year in Ireland. No sooner had I dropped her off than I\u2019m already missing her . We have a conversation on Skype and, before our conversation, I looked at my mom\u2019s letters to me when I was a freshman in college. She was dying and she didn\u2019t want me to know. The letters were so moving because she\u2019s struggling to tell me who she is and she senses that she doesn\u2019t have much time. Then I would write my mother letters \u2014 and, of course, I have those letters too \u2014 in which I try to tell her who I am as I\u2019m taking this next step in my life. So here I have my daughter on Skype and we\u2019re sharing every intimate detail of her life. She\u2019s holding up her dress. We\u2019re deciding on her shoes. I mean, I could not be more involved, and I\u2019m like telling her, \u201CWell, wouldn\u2019t you want to maybe, you know, write me a letter?\u201D So she says, \u201CWell, why don\u2019t you write me a letter?\u201D Then I sort of say, well, you know, in some ways, this book is my letter to her because in this book I talk about my concerns about what kind of legacy this generation will leave to the next, and what are the things we want to leave? You know, what are the things that, if we don\u2019t pass them on, even with this new technology, we\u2019re going to feel we didn\u2019t do our job? And I know the ones for me. I mean, I have the ones that are important to me. I feel very strongly about privacy, a very important conversation. You know, I can\u2019t necessarily make that conversation come out the way I want it, but I want to make sure that my voice is heard in the mix. That\u2019s very important to me. And then solitude, the importance of solitude. And this question of where leadership lies in starting these important questions about how we shape technology to be humane and sustainable, and the possibilities of that answer are more interesting because of the nature of this technology, right? There\u2019s a possibility for everyone to be a leader on their Facebook page or as they reshape their family lives. I don\u2019t know. Yes. You have special powers from sitting at MIT to really shape this big public discussion, but it\u2019s not limited to people like you. No. I think that\u2019s what really makes this technology so \u2014 so powerful. Mm-hmm. Is that, I mean, look at the way it empowers citizens politically. Yeah. You know, look at what\u2019s going on in the Middle East. You know, we need to take our inspiration from that, that people can make political revolution. You know, we can make revolutions in how we want to, you know, think about questions like privacy in our own country, civil liberties in our own country, the way we want to run our family lives. Right. So I\u2019m optimistic because the people who I interviewed were not happy about the place that we\u2019d come to. People sense that there\u2019s something amiss. There are a lot of people out there who \u2014 they love their phones, they love their music, they love listening to their books on their MP3 players, as do I. But there\u2019s something about this that is just tipped out of balance and they want to get it right. Sherry Turkle is Abby Rockefeller Mauz\u00E9 Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT. She\u2019s founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self. Her books include Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other. Near the end of that book, Sherry Turkle quotes Thoreau writing about his two years of retreat: \u201CI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately \u2026 I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear \u2026\u201D \u201CThoreau\u2019s quest,\u201D Sherry Turkle writes, \u201Cinspires us to ask of our life with technology: Do we live deliberately?\u201D What do you think? What are you doing to lead an examined digital life? Let us know at onbeing.org. We\u2019re learning more all the time about our digital spaces. Our website is a space for deep listening and learning. On Facebook, we find we can reflect, connect, and engage. Tumblr is one of those places where we learn as much as we give \u2014 discovering communities and people who are moved by beauty, both visually and in word. And on Instagram, there we share our favorite quotations paired with photographs. Finally, after years making fun of Twitter, I\u2019ve recently embraced it as a source of community, poetry, and wisdom. Follow me @kristatippett; follow our show @beingtweets. And find links to all of this at onbeing.org. Next time, millions of people have watched Bren\u00E9 Brown\u2019s TED talk. She\u2019s become a world-changing and life-changing voice with her research into how vulnerability makes everything possible. Please join us. This is APM, American Public Media."
