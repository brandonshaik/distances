  "fullText": "Natalie Batalha hunts for \u201Cexoplanets\u201D \u2014 Earth-sized planets beyond our own solar system \u2014 that might have liquid water and harbor life. She works with the Kepler Mission at NASA, searching among millions of stars that emit \u201Ccompelling signals\u201D in the range of Kepler\u2019s space telescope. For her, it\u2019s only a matter of time \u2014 a when, not an if \u2014 that we discover planets where we know life exists. And, I\u2019ve never met anyone who speaks more intriguingly than Natalie Batalha about the connection between science, love, and gratitude for life. She is a luminous voice for the way exploring the heavens \u2014 as we do that now \u2014 is bringing the beauty of the cosmos and the exuberance of scientific discovery closer home to us all. We are extending our senses out into the cosmos in a very real, tangible way, and that makes it so much easier to capture our imagination, to inspire us. You know, through the Curiosity Rover, we are standing there in our hiking boots on the surface of Mars. Man, I can practically hear the crunching of the dirt underneath my feet. You know, it feels like I could bend down and pick up a rock and toss it over that hill over there, you know? So in a very real way, these experiments are extending our senses out into the cosmos. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being, from APM, American Public Media. Natalie Batalha is a research astronomer at NASA Ames Research Center and a mission scientist with the Kepler space telescope. She helped discover the first approximately Earth-sized rocky planet outside our solar system. Here on earth, she also keeps a lyrical Facebook page \u2014 like this entry from March 2012, on the third anniversary of the Kepler telescope launch. She wrote: \u201CI am inspired by the way that science connects us to one another, transcending borders, transcending time. I am inspired by the way that science is reuniting us with the universe, with these distant places in the galaxy which are becoming destinations \u2014 real worlds in their own right with their own stories and \u2026 who knows what else.\u201D I\u2019ve really enjoyed just digging into things you\u2019ve written, interviews you\u2019ve given, watching the panel you were on at World Science Festival and also looking at your Facebook page, which is wonderfully profound. Oh, jeez . I mean, you\u2019ve described yourself now as a planet hunter, and I wonder if you\u2019d heard that phrase in your childhood. Was there anything in your earliest life that pointed at that? That this is being where your passion would go? No, not at all, not even remotely. You know, when I was a kid, gosh, what did I want to do? I wanted to be a gymnast. I wanted to be like Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci, and I wanted, you know \u2014 I was a cheerleader in high school and, you know, my parents didn\u2019t go to college, so I didn\u2019t really have examples in my life of what that was and I didn\u2019t know what it meant to be a scientist. I imagined it as a boring job. I imagined a, you know, Caucasian male, middle-aged, dressed in a white lab coat sitting by himself in a lab. You know, that wasn\u2019t me. Nevertheless, there were things along the way, you know. I\u2019m perhaps too young to remember the Apollo program. I was, I think, two or three years old when man landed on the moon, so I don\u2019t really have that as a guidepost. But certainly the shuttle program in the 1980s when I was in high school really, really, of course, it touched us all. We all got that bug of exploration and, you know, I saw that as just the most exciting job anybody could possibly have on planet Earth. So I think that that was the backdrop. I like the way you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen you talking about how you got into science. Didn\u2019t you start out studying business in college? Is that right? I did, yeah. Yeah, and that you took a physics class and that you weren\u2019t actually very good at it, which is comforting. I think that\u2019s good for people to hear. Physics is hard, yeah . Yeah. And, you know, you weren\u2019t immediately a genius, but that you had this epiphany around somebody explaining rainbows in oil puddles to you. Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. I remember the moment very clearly. I enrolled in that physics class and, oh, boy, I struggled. Man, it was just a completely new way of thinking. I had never had to do that before. Developing those analytical, you know, powers, mental capacities, was really new. But as you said, that key moment came sitting in a lecture hall at UC Berkeley, you know, with those old wooden desks in one of these big lecture halls, the dusty chalkboard at the front and, you know, the professor with the blazer and all of that. You can picture the scenario, you know. It\u2019s just stereotypical, right? And he\u2019s talking in just kind of monotone, in a monotone voice, about refraction, which is, you know, the behavior of light interacting with different media, bending the light waves and separating out the different colors of light in different directions and how we see a rainbow as a consequence. And he\u2019s describing this and he uses this analogy, the rainbow of color on an oil slick, you know, floating on top of water, which, of course, we\u2019ve all seen. It\u2019s something so common to us. And at the same time, he\u2019s writing down all these mathematical equations on the board and it just struck me at that moment, my gosh, you know, the universe is not a random collection of chaotic, you know, events. It can be explained with numbers. It can be explained with math. Even beauty can be explained with numbers and with math. Exactly. And at that moment, I think I all of a sudden had this idea that, you know, maybe all of the mysteries of the universe are there for us to discover. Maybe there\u2019s no limit to what we could know if the universe is so ordered. And that was very profound to me, so at that point, there was no going back . At that point, you know, despite the \u201CC\u201D I earned in that class, I was actually quite proud of that \u201CC.\u201D I was very, very proud of that \u201CC\u201D and took it from there and very quickly I did learn how to think that way and it changed my brain in exciting ways. So this sphere you\u2019ve ended up taking this passion into is this world of looking for planets, or this world of exoplanets. I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, you know, when I first heard it. It\u2019s planets outside our solar system. Is that right? That\u2019s right. We\u2019re looking for not planets in our own solar system. We\u2019re looking for \u2014 you know, exo means out, so outside the solar system, planets orbiting, gravitationally bound and orbiting other stars in our galaxy. And there was a great breakthrough in this in 1995. Could you explain what we learned then that\u2019s helped set this field off? Yeah, absolutely. I actually fortuitously happened to be there. Oh, I didn\u2019t know that. Yeah. I was a graduate student at the time, and my adviser was responsible for constructing an instrument on the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii. This was the world\u2019s largest telescope at the time. And I had the great fortune of being able to use some of the data that was taken, that very first light data from that telescope, in that particular instrument. So I think actually he got invited to go to this conference and talk about the data, but he couldn\u2019t go, so he sent me instead. And very naively, as a graduate student, there I am sitting in the audience and Michel Mayor, a Swiss astronomer, gets up to give a talk. And there are television cameras kind of over to the side. And Michel Mayor proceeded to tell us about the very first discovery of a planet orbiting another star in our galaxy. This was 51 Peg. 51 Peg is the name of the star; 51 Peg b is the name of the planet. You know, at the time, I mean, I listened and kind of took it all in, but it didn\u2019t really dawn on me at the time, I think, the implications and where this was going. And I\u2019ve only later begun to appreciate the historical significance of that event. That was humanity\u2019s first discovery of a planet orbiting another star like our sun. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with astronomer Natalie Batalha. She\u2019s with NASA\u2019s Kepler Mission, which is searching for habitable planets. It\u2019s named after the 17th-century astronomer who first described the laws of planetary motion. So one thing I\u2019ve come to, I think, understand through researching you is that orbit, that planetary motion, is one of the critical things we\u2019re looking for when we\u2019re looking for planets that could be \u2014 where life could be possible, right? That\u2019s exactly right. That could be habitable. Planets in what they say is this Goldilocks zone of not too hot, not too cold, just right . Exactly. We\u2019re looking for a planet for Goldilocks. That\u2019s right . Would you say a little bit more about Kepler? Because I just think he\u2019s in that league of Copernicus and Galileo and Newton, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s known quite as well by people. Johannes Kepler, yeah. He lived in the 1600s and was a mathematician, very, very brilliant mathematician. But he was also very \u2014 I don\u2019t know if spiritual is the right word, but he also had this really deep reverence for nature. There\u2019s a story. I don\u2019t know how much of it is myth and how much is fact, but there\u2019s a story that he was in a classroom giving a lecture on mathematics and geometry talking about the platonic solids, these solids that are comprised of equal-sided polygons on the sides and talking about how the geometry of them and how, if you nest them together, you get certain ratios between the radii of these shapes and, you know, just the geometry of it. And there\u2019s this great story that, in the middle of this lecture, he\u2019s talking about these ratios, this geometry and all of a sudden he stops. It\u2019s like stops him dead in his tracks and he realizes that the ratios he\u2019s describing are found in the solar system. And that seemed like an amazing coincidence to him, too amazing. All of a sudden, it seemed like that the numbers and the symmetries and geometries were intimately connected to the universe in a very fundamental, spiritual kind of way. And so he got fixated on that idea and he set about to prove it. The problem was that now we know it doesn\u2019t strictly hold true, but it seemed to him at the time through his human perspective that it was too big of a coincidence. It had to be true, you know. I mean, what ended up happening was he spent decades of his life trying to prove it and, in doing so, stumbled upon what is now known as the Laws of Planetary Motion. Oh, OK . That said, that\u2019s the way life works \u2026 He ended up discovering \u2014 well, it is, but also it\u2019s a testament to the scientific method. We have human biases. We have human perspectives and they bias the way we look at the universe. But if we stick to the facts, if we stick to the observations, it\u2019s a method of removing that human perspective and, when we do so, amazing things happen. We stumble upon something that\u2019s even more wonderful. But is it also that he was seeing something that was intriguing and following that hunch even though it didn\u2019t follow all the way through, took him in a direction that pointed at a real discovery. Is that also a way to see it? It\u2019s true, but, you know, it could have also just been that he wanted to find out what moves the planets and how they move, you know. I mean, it was a coincidence that that inspiring thought led him to the Laws of Planetary Motion because there\u2019s really no connection between these platonic solids and the laws of gravity, right? OK. They\u2019re completely distinct. They\u2019re completely different. Another aspect of this story that has really touched me deeply is his persistence and the fact that he just encountered roadblock after roadblock. He went down blind alleys, got to the end and had to turn around and walk his way back and he never gave up. And he had times in his life where he was just feeling despair, total utter despair and failure, and yet he never gave up. And it\u2019s that persistence, time and time again, I\u2019m seeing in the history of humanity, it\u2019s that persistence that always leads to greatness. And the Kepler Mission itself is kind of an example of that because, you know, it\u2019s a NASA mission, but it actually was rejected by NASA five times \u2026 I didn\u2019t know that . \u2026 before it was selected. Yeah, the guy whose brainchild this was has been working on the idea since the 1980s and it wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 that it was finally selected. But, again, he was an example of a man who just didn\u2019t \u2026 MS. TIPPETT: And what\u2019s his name? William Borucki, Bill Borucki at NASA Ames. He just, you know, doesn\u2019t see rejection or failure as \u2014 he doesn\u2019t take it personally, you know. You just keep on going because you love the science. He loved doing it. You love the process of discovery and learning. So that was another great lesson that I learned from Johannes. And when I listen and try to understand what the Kepler Mission is doing, how you\u2019re doing that science, I mean, just in the context of what you just said, it certainly is an exercise in just incredible patience, right? Almost superhuman patience, right? Right . You\u2019re looking at millions of stars. You know, you\u2019re looking for, you know, in lay terms, the needle in the haystack. It is the needle in the haystack, yeah. Right, that might be habitable. Yeah, that\u2019s right. You know, we\u2019re inferring the existence of these planets by looking for these dimmings of light that happen if a planet in its orbit about the stars passes directly in front of the star, kind of eclipsing it slightly. So what you\u2019re actually looking \u2014 what will be your signal in fact is not something you see, but the dimming of light. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re measuring the brightnesses of stars. We\u2019re not actually taking pictures of stars and planets. We\u2019re measuring their brightnesses. And in this one patch of sky that we\u2019re looking at, like you said, there are millions of stars, literally 4.5 million stars near the Milky Way, the plain of the Milky Way, a patch of sky that\u2019s about the size of my open hand, you know, stretched out in front of me. And we\u2019ve chosen about 150,000 that we\u2019re monitoring. So we collect the light through a space telescope and that light is sent down to a detector, which is just an array of CCDs. It\u2019s exactly what you have in your digital camera when you take a picture. And those detectors are measuring the amount of light that falls on them from these 150,000 stars. So we take a measurement of all these stars simultaneously once every 30 minutes, and we\u2019ve been doing that for three and half years . And the point is, you take these measurements and you want to do it without blinking because eventually some of those stars are going to have planetary systems that are orbiting and aligned in such a way that the planet will pass directly between our telescope and the star. And when it does that, that planet is going to cast its shadow out into space and that shadow is going to sweep across our telescope and our detectors are going to perceive that as a dimming of light. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re inferring the existence of the planets. Those signals are tiny and they last, you know, a couple of hours and they repeat once every year. So you really do need patience. You need to stare at these things consistently without blinking waiting for these signals to occur. I think it was on the third anniversary of the Kepler launch. When was that? 2009? Yeah. It launched in March of 2009. I wanted to read this back to you \u2014 it\u2019s very beautiful \u2014 of the Kepler saying, \u201CThe diversity of the phenomena of nature is so vast and the treasures hidden in the heavens so rich precisely in order that the human mind shall never be lacking in fresh nourishment.\u201D I thought that was an interesting way to describe at least some angle of, you know, what the scientific endeavor is. I mean, does that ring true for you? Oh, my gosh. One way to think about the meaning of science, this nourishment of the human mind? Absolutely. I mean, you read it and it makes my eyes all misty . It does. I mean, I\u2019ve lived it and I feel it and I have this intense, as I said, reverence for the mysteries of the cosmos and this drive of discovery, you know, this desire to know. Maybe it\u2019s because I want to find meaning for my own life. You know, there\u2019s something innate about us human beings that makes us want to seek the unknown, to push the boundaries, to find new horizons, to see new things. You know, I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re like that, but we are. You know, Carl Sagan has a quote that\u2019s akin to this. He said, \u201CUnderstanding is a form of ecstasy.\u201D It really is. I mean, when we have these aha moments, you know, when we really understand something or there\u2019s a spark of understanding, we feel that euphoria. I try to tell that to kids, you know. I talk to kids. In fact, I just got back from a two-week tour in India. I spoke to probably something like 3,000 to 5,000 children in India, high school-aged, and asked them why are we going out there and finding planets? Why are we doing this? And the answers are very diverse, but a lot of people raised their hand and said, \u201CBecause I want to know if there\u2019s life out there.\u201D I also think that this act of discovery, this act of exploration, it changes us. You know, we\u2019re evolving toward something. I often wonder or I think about the transition that life underwent here on planet Earth when it went from water or ocean to land. And then I extrapolate that and I wonder what will happen to us as a species as we transition from land to space. What potential will be released? You know, how will we change? How will we evolve? What implications does that have? And that thought excites me a lot. And the way you say that, it sounds like for you it\u2019s a given that we\u2019ll make that transition. I mean, I also hear it seems to me that a given or certainly a possibility that you and your colleagues are devoted to realizing is that maybe even in our lifetimes we might look out and know that there are habitable planets. Is that right? Well, that\u2019s a given. I mean, we\u2019re doing that now. That\u2019s a given? Absolutely. I mean, that\u2019s Kepler and it\u2019s only a matter of time before we will know of outposts that do harbor life. We\u2019re headed in that direction. How do you think about what is at stake in that discovery? What difference does it make in your imagination if that turns out to be true? When you look up at the sky, I\u2019m sure all humans have had this experience of looking up into the sky on a very dark night and looking at those stars or that crescent moon or whatever it is. What do you feel, you know? You feel wonder, of course. You feel humility. But I think you also feel lonely, small, insignificant, you know. There\u2019s a profound sense of loneliness, I think, or just the universe is so big and I\u2019m so small. But imagine in the near-term future, you know, your grandchild or your great-grandchild looks up in the sky and his mother can point to a star and say, you know, that star right there? That star has a planet just like Earth, and it harbors life. That\u2019s a different perspective. That\u2019s completely different, you know, when we can look up in the sky and know that. It\u2019s a game-changer. You know, I suppose where most of our minds go would be to science fiction, which is the place where we have imaginatively explored that. But then it\u2019s so interesting for me to read that in 2011 Kepler actually discovered a planet that had a double sunset like the one in Star Wars. Yes, yes, like the Tatooine . Right. That\u2019s what seems \u2026 Science fiction, yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, do you watch science fiction or read science fiction? How do you populate your imagination with \u2026 You know, interestingly, I\u2019m an exception to the rule. I did not grow up as an avid science fiction fan. Star Trek fan? I like it. You know, don\u2019t get me wrong. I do. I like it. It\u2019s funny with Star Trek, more than the alien encounters, you know, I really enjoyed the ethical questions that Star Trek raises, you know. I loved the character Data and what that meant for our humanity. And I didn\u2019t need any help with my imagination, I guess. I didn\u2019t need science fiction. But it is interesting how science informs science fiction, but the opposite is quite true as well: science fiction informs \u2014 not informs science, but inspires science as well, and it\u2019s an interesting interplay that speaks to our humanity.

On Twitter, follow our show @beingtweets. I share my thoughts, @kristatippett. Coming up, how a life in science has made Natalie Batalha think about love as akin to dark energy. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with astronomer Natalie Batalha of NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope Mission. We\u2019re talking about what she learns about life in the cosmos and on Earth through this work. So mystery is a term you\u2019ve used and it\u2019s a term I hear a lot of scientists using. You know, with Kepler I think it would have had religious connotations. But even if it doesn\u2019t, I mean, it\u2019s a word Einstein used a great deal. It\u2019s certainly there for you. I mean, I want to read a little bit back of yourself \u2026 From Facebook? Yes, yes. Now I know. That\u2019s where some people write poetry. \u201CReality is a poem on the tip of my tongue that I can\u2019t quite remember, familiar yet distant. It\u2019s a form seen through a veil.\u201D And later on, you write, you know, that \u201Cas a scientist you live life as if every mystery is there for us to discover and understand.\u201D Yeah, yeah, I feel that, yes. I think that\u2019s what inspires me. I read a lot of people with the opposite perspective, and it seems very sad to me to have that perspective that there is a limit to what we can know. You know, interestingly, Carl Sagan\u2019s book Broca\u2019s Brain, one of the very beginning chapters is, I think, called \u201CReflections on a Grain of Salt.\u201D And the idea is, you know, is there a limit to what we can know. I kind of have this feeling like we walk around in our human existence trying to create an image of the universe in our brain, trying to reproduce the universe by recording it in our brain and working towards making that image beautiful and accurate and, you know, learning and all of that. So Carl asked the question, well, what is the limitation of our brain? Can our brain record the universe? Then he goes through this really simple argument. He says, well, you know, let\u2019s look at how many atoms are in a grain of salt, just one tiny crystal of salt. You know, if we\u2019re going to know a crystal of salt, if we\u2019re going to make an image of that in our brain, we have to know at least something about the positions of all the atoms. And, of course, there\u2019s more to know, right? How are those atoms moving and interacting and all that? But let\u2019s just make it simple. Then he says, OK, if we\u2019re going to know the positions of these atoms, how many atoms are there? How many neurons are there in our brain? You know, what do we know about how we store information in our brain? And he quickly concludes that, no, we cannot know the universe in our mind. Then he goes on to say, unless there are unifying theories, unless there are patterns, unless the universe is not chaos, unless the universe is ordered \u2014 because if it is ordered and if there are patterns, if there are rules, then we can boil down that one grain of salt into a couple of facts that we can record in our brain and use to reconstruct the universe. So that idea is very exciting. You know, how much of the universe is ordered? How can we coalesce it down into the basics? I mean, here\u2019s a way you\u2019ve written about \u2014 just some language you\u2019ve used. \u201CWhat we observe out there is that nature is creative, prolific, robust.\u201D So I want to ask this question. How does that sense of the universe, of nature that you get, how does that inform the way you move through the world? The way you think about life and your life? Oh, goodness. There\u2019s a lot of suffering to human existence, right? So you made me think of that. You know, nature is prolific and robust and all of that and creative. We overcome adversity and we do things. We push the envelope. We do things that we once thought were impossible and all of that. I wrote those words thinking about the possibility of life. You know, there\u2019s kind of two schools of thought as to whether or not there\u2019s other life out there in the universe. On one side of the spectrum, you\u2019ve got the pluralists, the people who say, you know, there are 400 flippin\u2019 billion stars in our galaxy and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. How could there possibly not be life out there, right? So the idea is just that there are so many stars, so many worlds out there, there\u2019s got to be life. On the other hand, on the other side of the spectrum, you have maybe I\u2019ll call them the Rare Earthers. These are the people that say, you know, there are so many coincidences that had to converge, so many subtle properties that all had to hang together and converge here on planet Earth to make life possible, and that\u2019s probably not very common. You know, it\u2019s a confluence of many different things that had to happen. So you\u2019ve got these two extremes. And, for me, I look around here on planet Earth and I say, well, you know, no matter how extreme the environment here on Earth, no matter how dark, how cold, how hot, how arid, how acidic, no matter how extreme the environment, there seems to be life. And that\u2019s what inspired me to say that nature seems to be prolific and creative and robust and, you know, put itself in every nook and cranny. And if it does that here on planet Earth, my thought is that it\u2019s going to do it out there in the universe as well. I mean, you also bring words like love. You just mentioned suffering. I think something that\u2019s very intriguing about you as a scientist, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re confusing these things with your science or conflating them, but I sense that this life of discovery that you\u2019re involved in does bring you back to think about something like love differently. That it informs and somehow infuses your thinking about that. So talk to me about that. Yeah. This has been the surprise to me actually that my perspective on love has been so informed by science, but it has. It\u2019s been fundamentally shifted, you know. And then I read other scientists who\u2019ve had the same perspective and it all kind of makes sense. I mean, Carl Sagan\u2019s quote, you know: \u201CFor small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love.\u201D This love, this idea, is this moving force. I mean, it just permeates our history, our culture. I\u2019ve equated it to, you know, this analogy of dark matter. Right. Ninety-five percent of the mass of the universe being something we can\u2019t even see, and yet it moves us. It draws us. It creates galaxies. We\u2019re like moving on a current of this gravitational field created by mostly stuff that we can\u2019t see. And the analogy with love just struck me, you know, that it\u2019s like this thing that we can\u2019t see, that we don\u2019t understand yet. It\u2019s everywhere and it moves us. And science has given me that perspective, but also in very logistical, tangible, practical ways, you know. I mean, when you study science, you step out of planet Earth. You look back down at this blue sphere and you see a world with no borders. Right, right. You see a tiny mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. You see the expanse of the cosmos and you realize how small we are and how connected we are and that we are all the same and that what\u2019s good for you has to be good for me, you know. I mean, it just changes your perspective. Was there a moment or did something happen where you first realized you were thinking about love the way you were thinking about dark energy? Oh, my goodness. I mean, because it\u2019s a really interesting connection. Also thinking it changes what you think about love. It is an energy, right? It\u2019s not just a feeling inside you. I mean, with my own personal experiences, you know, being middle-aged and having raised four children \u2026 I know. You have four children. I have four children and, you know, just going through life and all of life\u2019s challenges and adversity and losing people that we love and all of those things make us think about love. You know, we need to be loved and to love to be happy. With science, I think about life out there in the universe. I think about our connectedness. I guess connectedness is a key word. Studying science, you realize the connectedness of all things. You know, we are stardust and here I am, this bag of stardust, and it took how many billions of years for the atoms that make up my body to come together and make this being that\u2019s able to take a conscious look at the universe. I mean, I am the universe and I\u2019m taking a look at myself through these senses that I have and that is an amazing thing. For you, that\u2019s such a concrete statement. Somebody else could say that and it might seem a little flaky, but you really know what you\u2019re talking about . I mean, you\u2019ve discovered the first rocky planet and things like that. You really know these things. Yeah, yeah. Well, no, that\u2019s a good point. I don\u2019t necessarily mean it in kind of a hippie flowers-in-my-hair kind of way. You know, it\u2019s easy to say all these fluffy philosophical words that make us all warm and fuzzy, but there are really practical, you know, connections. There are things that I do see that are real, that are part of what we\u2019re discovering. You know, I said to the kids in India actually just last week, I said, you know, we were talking about love at the end of my lecture. I said, OK \u2014 they were teenagers, right? So I said, how many of you are on Facebook? Of course, everybody raises their hand, right? I said, OK, why does it give you so much pleasure? Why? You know, think about the happiness that it gives you. You know, what is it exactly? You\u2019re connecting to other human beings and that gives you joy. You have this huge array of people that you resonate with and that gives you joy. So I\u2019m thinking about this as love and how we experience the connectedness between us as creatures here on planet Earth. And then I start to wonder what is the potential when we are able to connect not just with human beings on planet Earth, but with other species out in the universe? What will we feel? How can this idea of love be extended not just to my family, not just to my community, not just to my country, but to planet Earth and out into the universe once we find life out there? It seems to me there\u2019s an awful lot of potential there that we\u2019ve yet to tap into, right? This animating question that I\u2019m always following is, you know, what does it mean to be human and what do we learn about that in all these different lives we lead and this knowledge we have? You\u2019re taking that question of what it means to be human, right? You\u2019re taking it to this place where you\u2019re also thinking about us connecting with life which may or may not be like us, beyond our species. Right, yeah. I mean, there\u2019s a definition on your Facebook page, again \u2014 I hope you pointed those Indian students to your Facebook page. I do. You said this, again, this question in my mind, you know, how does this work you do shape the way you think about what it means to be human and you wrote that you were \u201Caware of the billions of years it took for the atoms to come together and make the portal to the universe that is my physical self.\u201D That is a fascinating definition of what it means to be human, that we are portals to the universe. Yeah. That\u2019s about as much as I can say about it. I mean, that\u2019s the reality, right? And why that exists, I don\u2019t know. You know, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any meaning. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m headed. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re here. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re observing the universe and making this record, this recording, this impression of the universe in our brain, this thing that is our brain. I don\u2019t know why, but I know that it\u2019s leading us someplace, that we do have this innate curiosity, this drive of using this portal to the universe to observe and to learn and it\u2019s taking us someplace. And along the way, it\u2019s changing us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being, today with astronomer Natalie Batalha of NASA\u2019s Kepler Mission. What is the planet hunters project that involves citizens that you\u2019ve been part of or you\u2019ve been a real champion of, right? Yeah, absolutely. This is part of the Zooniverse project, which provides an interface of \u2014 it gives the citizens an opportunity to experience this excitement of scientific discovery. So what it is for Kepler, you go to the website and a backend computer system is going to serve you Kepler data. It\u2019s going show you the actual data that we look at. It\u2019s these brightness measurements as a function of time. And you can loop through these and the computer will ask you a couple of very simple questions. It\u2019ll say, you know, what do you see? What does this look like to you? It\u2019ll give you some options and just very, very simple questions. And you tool through this data and, in doing so, you have the opportunity to find something interesting that our computer algorithms have missed. I mean, the human brain is an amazing pattern-recognition tool, right? We\u2019ve tried to simulate that with a very, very sophisticated powerful computer pipeline that analyzes our data and it does really, really well. Don\u2019t get me wrong. But we can\u2019t design one algorithm that can handle the diversity of nature, right? There are going to be surprises, right? So you put a million people, citizens, in front of a computer looking and they\u2019re going to find things that we missed and that is exactly what\u2019s happened.They have had two papers, actually a third paper just came out, with new planet candidates that they have identified, four new planet candidates from the Kepler data. And in addition, they just found one of these circumbinary planets like Tatooine in Star Wars with one of these two planets. Yeah, in fact, it\u2019s two planets orbiting a double-star system. So the reason I think that this is so tremendously important is because it shows \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t understand what science was until I started doing it and experienced that thrill of discovery. It\u2019s all about that thrill of discovery, and it\u2019s not about a Caucasian middle-aged male in a white lab coat mixing chemicals in a lab all by himself. That\u2019s not science, you know. It\u2019s the discovery. And if people could just realize that at a younger age, I think more people in our country, you know, a country where people aren\u2019t necessarily opting to do science, I think that more people would catch that bug and pursue science as a career. You actually did make a really important discovery or you helped discover the first rocky planet orbiting a star outside our solar system. Yes, that\u2019s correct. What was that like? Oh, my gosh, that was an amazing experience. So the Kepler Mission launched in March of 2009. You know, you\u2019d launch this thing. You put this very sensitive instrument on this tower of explosives and you send it out into space and it gets up there and, of course, you have to check out that everything\u2019s still OK. You know, it\u2019s like a one-month period where we\u2019re kind of on pins and needles checking out the spacecraft making sure everything\u2019s fine and doing all of our calibrations and all of that. Then there\u2019s this 10-day period where we open up the telescope to stars and we start taking our very first observations and it\u2019s kind of a trial run. And in that 10 days, in that trial run, we saw already the signal of a small planet, what could be a small planet, orbiting a star about 540 light years away, a star that we later called Kepler 10. And that was an exciting moment for you. Oh, it was tremendous. You know, to see the signal in the data so clearly in that first 10 days, of course, showed that everything was working right, so it was exciting from that perspective. But also, just to have that discovery, to know. I mean, that was our first indication that, oh, my God, we\u2019re going to find lots of these things. We\u2019re going find lots of Earth-sized planets, and that was tremendously exciting. I feel like something that\u2019s happening now and you just embody it is somehow these space telescopes are making a big difference. You know, Hubble is one that people see these images. It\u2019s kind of bringing all of that more into awareness, right? It feels more real and also getting a sense of the exuberance and beauty that\u2019s not just in the images that come back, but in this process of discovery. You know, in people like you who are working on this frontier. Right, yeah. You know, there\u2019s something new happening that doesn\u2019t all feel so abstract anymore. Interesting. What did Kepler call it? He called the work he was doing \u201Ccelestial physics.\u201D Because I guess they hadn\u2019t even \u2026 That is very abstract, isn\u2019t it ? Yes, right. Right, but astronomy and physics at that point, interestingly, were two separate disciplines. Yeah, do you know what I mean? That\u2019s why I think when people hear somebody like you talk, it\u2019s a revelation that this is what science is, that this is what it is to be a scientist and it\u2019s the spirit of it. It\u2019s the joy of it as much as anything else. It\u2019s the discovery. You know, I think what you\u2019re saying maybe is that now in very concrete ways we are, through our instruments, our telescopes, our robots on Mars, we\u2019re extending our senses out into the cosmos in a very real, tangible way. And that makes it so much easier, you know, to capture our imagination, to inspire us. You know, through the Curiosity rover, we are standing there in our hiking boots on the surface of Mars. Man, I can practically hear the crunching of the dirt underneath my feet. You know, it feels like I could bend down and pick up a rock and toss it over that hill over there, you know. I mean, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like. So in a very real way, these experiments are extending our senses out into the cosmos. When you take a walk or take a run and you look at the night sky, with all this work you do, with all this data and these images that you\u2019re working with all the time and everything you know about what we call space, what do you see? What do you take in? Goodness, I have so many examples it\u2019s hard to pick just one. I\u2019ve had some really key moments in my life, two in particular, maybe I can tell you about. One is very simple. I was out on a run actually. You mentioned running. I was out on a run and it was summertime, so I like to run at night when it\u2019s dark in the summertime because it\u2019s nice and cool. As I\u2019m running, I\u2019m thinking about lots of different things. But, of course, I also think about work and the discoveries that we\u2019re making and, you know, I talk to people a lot about it. So it\u2019s a lot on my mind. As I\u2019m running home, I look up at the sky and the moon was hanging on the horizon over in the west and I look up at the stars. And in that split second, just that fraction of a second when I first saw the starry sky, I saw not pinpoints of light, which are stars. I saw planetary systems. I saw solar systems. I saw other planets out there. And it\u2019s really hard to describe what I felt. It\u2019s really hard to articulate that kind of an experience. It\u2019s something very personal. You know, when you look up and you see something in a very different way, it\u2019s like I internalized deeply what I\u2019ve been discovering, what Kepler has been discovering as a scientist. So that\u2019s what I mean when I say that when we\u2019ll look up at the sky and we will look at it differently. I\u2019ve experienced that in a very real, tangible way. So that\u2019s one example. Another really important moment in my life was when I went to Chile to the European Southern Observatory when I was a young post-doc and working in Brazil. In the middle of the night, the sky, of course, is completely black. I mean, just starry sky \u2014 and you\u2019re in the Southern Hemisphere. I decided to climb up onto the roof of the telescope building that I was using that night. There was like a ladder and stairs that go up to the top and a platform where you can stand. Astronomers do that, you know. We go out and we look at the sky and see how it\u2019s doing, seeing if there\u2019s clouds and all that kind of stuff. So now I\u2019m on top of this gigantic mountain, not only on top of a mountain, but on top of a building on top of a mountain. So I lay down actually on the roof of this building and literally all around me there was nothing but stars, right? We don\u2019t get to experience that very often, having this complete dome over your head, which is the universe. But the experience that I had was that I saw the Milky Way arcing through the sky. I saw planets that were in the sky. I think there was a crescent moon that was in the sky. I could see the large and small Magellanic Clouds, which are satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way. I saw the Coalsack Nebula, which is this giant molecular cloud between us and the center of the galaxy. I saw all of these things and I knew something about them. I had knowledge of them and this knowledge of them gave me three-dimensionality to the universe. It transformed itself. It was not a dome over my head. It was a three-dimensional universe that I was suspended in and that was an amazing moment for me. It changed the way I saw the universe and my place in the universe. And it was afforded me through my knowledge and my studies of astronomy and I think that it\u2019s a gift, and I wish it for humanity. I really, really deeply do. Natalie Batalha is a research astronomer at NASA Ames Research Center and a mission scientist with the Kepler space telescope. NASA has extended the Kepler Mission to 2016. In its first four years, the mission confirmed over 100 new planets \u2014 but the search for one just right for life continues. Early interpretations of Kepler data point to as many as 17 billion Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone.
