  "fullText": "It\u2019s rare these days to hear straight talk about politics or the economy \u2014 voices of conscience over agenda. But we will, here, for the next hour. We get candor and wisdom from two Washington insiders who won\u2019t give partisan gridlock the last word: longtime Republican lawmaker Pete Domenici and veteran Democratic economist Alice Rivlin. Both sides are trying to scare people into thinking if you vote for this other guy, it\u2019s going to be a terrible time. And Medicare is a good example. Both sides are trying to scare seniors that their Medicare will be destroyed. That\u2019s not even remotely possible. What\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve let it go and fester, and the problem gets so complicated that we are the victims of its complexity in terms of trying to carry it out. There are all kinds of members that want to do something but they don\u2019t know where to go. They don\u2019t know \u2026 And I think citizens feel the same way. And I think citizens feel the same way. They say we\u2019ve learned about it, what can I do to save this country? \u201CPolitical Bridge People\u201D \u2014 a dialogue of the Civil Conversations Project. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. I interviewed Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin before a live audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Four years after the economic downturn, the economy remains a tumultuous territory that permeates the news and the way many of us think and worry on a very personal level about core human concerns from housing to aging to the education and future working lives of our children. Yet the budget debates that make the news are most often stalemates or outright political warfare \u2014 clashes followed by fragile compromise between seemingly irreconcilable values and concerns. The matter of deficit reduction is discussed in terms of numbers, of cuts in revenues, with little searching acknowledgement of the human and moral consequences that lie behind those numbers. And this breeds fatigue, confusion and \u2014 most destructively, perhaps, in a Democracy \u2014 a disconnect and cynicism among the very citizens who must hold their elected officials accountable and, indeed, be part of the reversal of the culture of debt if that is to happen. Alice Rivlin and Pete Domenici are political bridge people. This is why I wanted to speak with them today. It\u2019s been said of Alice Rivlin that her dedication to serious, unglamorous budget issues is unrivaled. That\u2019s a compliment. Thanks. And a Chicago newspaper once wrote of Pete Domenici: \u201CWhen you cut Pete Domenici, he bleeds black ink.\u201D And they have both been seen as forces of conscience on the roller coaster of the American budget process of the last several decades. So the idea behind this event is that it would be helpful, even and especially for people who are not familiar with the ins and outs of budgets, just to hear Alice Rivlin and Pete Domenici speak together, to hear what their bipartisan work together has taught them, and to draw out the wisdom that they have for this moment in American life. So I\u2019d like to begin with Alice Rivlin. Alice, your father was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project. Your mother was active with the League of Women Voters, among other things. I wonder if you could think about in your earliest life where you would trace the roots of the conscience and the moral imagination that has framed your life and public service. I think part of it comes from having been a teenager in World War II and in the college generation of the post-War years, which was very idealistic. We wanted to make sure that there wasn\u2019t another war. We were interested in things like world government, world federalism. I wasn\u2019t actually terribly active in that, but it pervaded a piece of my generation that really wanted to ensure world peace and prosperity and thought we could. I was really interested to read \u2014 this is beside the point, but it\u2019s so fascinating to me that when you applied to the School of Public Administration at Harvard when you were 22, they told you they didn\u2019t on principle not admit women, but they didn\u2019t admit women of marriageable age. Times have changed. Times have changed. That had to also be the beginnings of some tenacity, though. And Senator Domenici, your father ran a grocery store. Your mother was originally an undocumented Italian immigrant. And your sister Thelma once told an Albuquerque newspaper that \u201Cgrowing up surrounded by four sisters had prepared you well for prospering in a two-party system.\u201D So I wonder, aside from that character-building experience, where do you trace the roots in your earliest life of the conscience and moral imagination behind your public service? Well, you got it right. My mother and father were immigrants. I learned very early and believed very young that America was a wonderful, wonderful place. And that\u2019s why I worked so hard when I saw things going wrong, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so committed now and work with Alice on trying to get a balanced budget. Because I literally \u2014 others may not have, but I ended up not too long ago literally believing that we were on the brink of destroying America. Now, when you believe that, you\u2019ll work like hell to try to fix it and essentially I don\u2019t know how these people that are listening to me feel our future is, but I feel if we don\u2019t fix the budget our future is very gloomy and we are apt to have a very, very different America than we have. Now, if that isn\u2019t enough to make you do something, then obviously you ought to move to another country. You ought to get out of here, you know, I don\u2019t like this place, because if you like it that much, you\u2019ve got to try to fix it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do. You know, when I called you initially to talk about coming here today you said \u2014 I had spoken with Alice first and you said, \u201CAnything Alice Rivlin tells me to do, I\u2019ll do.\u201D But I can imagine that there have been times in the last 30 years since you\u2019ve worked together that you might be shocked that you would\u2019ve made that statement one day. You\u2019ve been on other sides of \u2026 Well, that\u2019s true. But if you don\u2019t know that person well enough to make that statement and believe it and say it will never hurt me \u2014 I think I know her so I don\u2019t have any problem making that statement. She would not ask me to do something that was against my conscience and my ideology. If she knew it, she would not make me do that. I mean, did you have a kind of working relationship and political relationship that this seemed like an obvious thing for you to start working together on the debt reduction taskforce? Or how did that happen? Yes. And you have to remember that when Pete and I first met, I was the director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. He was a freshman senator on the budget committee and I appeared frequently, testifying before the budget committee. And I quickly figured out, this man\u2019s really smart and he really cares about doing it right. So we had a mutual respect that goes back a long way. Now, we always knew that he was a Republican, I was a Democrat. And later, much later, actually, when I became the budget director in the first Clinton administration and Pete was the chairman of the budget committee in the Republican-dominated Senate, we were on opposite sides. Clearly. And we disagreed on substantive matters, but we never lost our respect for each other. And I think that\u2019s the key to this. People can disagree on all sorts of things, but if they listen to each other and have respect for each other, they can work things out. And we\u2019ve kind of lost that idea that you have to work things out and compromise and come to a conclusion. Because gridlock, which we have now in the budget, is the worst possible thing, especially with respect to a problem like the budget deficit, which gets worse if you do nothing. Gridlock is fatal for this problem. Right. Because the course we\u2019re on now is hurtling toward disaster over time, and we have to do something. Nothing is not the answer. So we don\u2019t want to, nor do we have the time to do ins and outs of the budget plan, so I want to just say let\u2019s lay out \u2014 establish \u2014 that there\u2019s a fundamental truth to your budget proposals. I love this phrase \u201Cthe simplicity on the other side of complexity.\u201D I\u2019ve heard it attributed to different people. I think I choose Oliver Wendell Holmes. But today when we talk about the budget, we\u2019re dealing with that, the simplicity on the other side of the complexity \u2014 that debt can and must be stabilized, that both political parties have brought about the situation we\u2019re in now. And when you wrote this together, this open letter to the American people, when you released the report on restoring America\u2019s future in 2010, you said, \u201CWe created this plan to show that it can be done.\u201D Right. Right. I guess the question that arises \u2014 and it\u2019s good to ask in a place like this \u2014 is given the political culture right now, could sitting politicians reach that kind of agreement? I mean, what have you learned that tells you that they could? Well, let me start on that. I also served on the Simpson-Bowles Commission, and it was mostly sitting politicians. And contrary to the public view of it, we actually had very civil conversations behind closed doors. They had to be behind closed doors because there was an election going on, the congressional election of 2010. But we came back every Wednesday to the Dirksen building and talked about the various aspects of the budget that needed to be solved and came together \u2014 now, not everybody voted for it but a majority of the group did \u2014 around a bipartisan solution. And at the end of the process, I thought Senator Tom Coburn said it best, a very conservative Republican senator from Oklahoma. He said: \u201CThere\u2019s a lot in this plan that I don\u2019t like but I\u2019ve figured something out. If we\u2019re going to solve this problem, Tom Coburn isn\u2019t going to get everything he wants.\u201D And that really summarized, to me, the idea of compromise. You\u2019ve got to give up something in order to solve the problem. And I\u2019m sure that Senator Dick Durbin, who\u2019s a liberal Democrat from Illinois, had the same thought, although he didn\u2019t express it exactly the same way. There was a lot in that he didn\u2019t like but he just, he signed it too. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CPolitical Bridge People.\u201D We\u2019re at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. I\u2019m with Pete Domenici, former six-term Republican Senator of New Mexico and veteran Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee; and economist Alice Rivlin. She was director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, and was the first director of the Congressional Budget Office. So where\u2019s the breakdown? What goes wrong between that possibility and then the reality that we see as it plays itself out? I think that what must happen to address an issue of this magnitude and this importance is that people in authority have to know the problem. Then the problem. They have to understand the problem. If they know and understand the problem, then they know and understand that this is really something important. It is the country\u2019s future. So if you know that, you are apt to sit down and address the issue as a person and say I\u2019m willing to sit with Alice, I\u2019m willing to talk with Joel, and I\u2019m willing to give because I know the problem. Now, what\u2019s happening to our country is more and more and more people know the problem. That\u2019s good. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019d have to have the whole population know the problem to get there. That\u2019s an exorbitant request of democracy. You\u2019re asking too much of it, of democracy, for that. But what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve let it go and fester, and the problem gets so complicated that we are the victims of its complexity in terms of trying to carry it out. There are all kinds of members that want to do something but they don\u2019t know where to go. And I think citizens feel the same way. And I think citizens feel the same way. They say, \u201CWe\u2019ve learned about it; what can I do to save this country? I want to be on Pete and Alice\u2019s side. I want to do something.\u201D So, I mean, what would your answer to someone be? I mean, just how would you help someone think about where to start? Well, at this point, it\u2019s pretty obvious to me that we\u2019ve got a little bit of time but it\u2019s also pretty obvious to me that we don\u2019t know how much time we have. And for those who think we have 20 years, they are truly willing to risk the future of a great country. For those who say it\u2019s got to be done next month, let\u2019s trot them off somewhere. They\u2019re kind of crazy too. Because the truth of the matter is it\u2019s too big and too complicated to get it done that way. But as a citizen, find out what is the real truth about this. And in my opinion, you should try to narrow it down to as few things as you can. Yeah. You\u2019re \u2014 and this being the economic \u2026 Plan. Any plan, any effort should be simple, put into as simple of terms as you. That\u2019s our problem and our job. Make it simple so that people can get it, can understand it. Once we have it and it\u2019s simple, then we\u2019ve got to work on the next step and that\u2019s how do we get it implemented. And of course that\u2019s as complicated an issue as we\u2019ve ever had. Alice? I think the essential thing for people to grasp is that we\u2019re on an unsustainable track. The debt is rising faster than our economy can grow. And almost anybody can figure out that\u2019s a bad thing. And then the second thing is that the things that you would have to do to make that not true are all unpleasant. You have only two choices: You have to raise revenues \u2014 not necessarily tax rates but the amount of money collected \u2014 and you have to reduce the rate of growth of the big spending programs, which are ones that everybody likes. They are Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those are the things that are driving the spending increase in the future. They aren\u2019t the only things we might adjust, but they are the basic cause of the problem going forward. So that bipartisan groups like ours and like Simpson-Bowles and actually like any other group that you pull together, have come to the conclusion you have to do two painful things over time: raise revenues and slow the growth of the entitlement programs. That\u2019s easy to demagogue. Mm-hmm. Right. It\u2019s easy to get out there if you\u2019re running for public office and say no cuts to Medicare, or I will cut your taxes, not raise them. And that\u2019s irresponsible talk for anybody who wants to solve the problem. I think you make the point again and again that because of the difficulty and unpopularity of what has to happen, bipartisan alliance is the only \u2014 because every side will lose by making these unpopular decisions and so essentially \u2014 what did you say once? You know, they have to join hands and jump together. Well, let me add one thing in there that I think is true. I don\u2019t think what the public has to undertake to help us get this done is as tough as it\u2019s being made. We\u2019re using words that scare people. \u201CCuts to Medicare\u201D \u2014 language by Democrats that says the Republicans are going to do away with Medicare as we know it. And they say that very cocky and what they believe and say that\u2019s it, it\u2019s over with. Well, the truth of the matter is we don\u2019t have to change Medicare an awful lot. It\u2019s just a little bit but it\u2019s a little bit over a long sustained period of time. You\u2019re not going to cancel the programs. In fact, within five, six, 10 years no one will know the difference, the programs will have been impacted that small amount. Raising of revenue. We\u2019re talking about, you know, we have hundreds of tax expenditures. That is, we give people things out of the tax code, hundreds of them worth billions of dollars. We have to pick and choose which ones we want to either take out or narrow down in application. People aren\u2019t even going to know that the first five years. That can be implemented over a 10-year period. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve got to sit down with pieces of paper and convince the people not to be frightened and not to let this talk by those who don\u2019t want to do anything, don\u2019t let them take hold. You know what? I think also that that language of numbers and revenues in itself, these feel like abstractions to people who don\u2019t write. So that language also, that way of talking about it, also creates anxiety, if not fear. Sure. That\u2019s right. But let me reinforce Pete\u2019s point. Because right now in this political campaign, both sides are trying to scare people into thinking if you vote for this other guy, it\u2019s going to be a terrible time. And Medicare is a good example. Both sides are trying to scare seniors that their Medicare will be destroyed. That\u2019s not even remotely possible. Politicians care about older people because they vote and Medicare is an extremely popular program. We need to adjust it at the margin, but nobody\u2019s going to destroy it. So one thing that \u2026 Let me say \u2026 Yeah, sure. \u2026 because they vote. That language is not bad language. The truth of the matter is this is a democracy, and the largest affected group by budget work are the senior citizens now and soon to be. By far, they are the biggest. Right. Right. The truth of the matter is we have to explain it better to seniors so they know this is fixing a program that\u2019s part of a budget so you\u2019ll have Medicare forever. If you\u2019d like to try America bankrupt and try to run Medicare, then go the other way. You\u2019ll have a bankrupt country trying to run a Medicare program. Would you like that? I don\u2019t think anyone would like that. In terms of diagnosing what\u2019s happening in the political culture that creates these dynamics, one idea that keeps coming up in this Civil Conversations I\u2019ve been having is that there\u2019s been a shift from opposing someone\u2019s position to opposing \u2014 casting aspersions on their motives. And that might not sound huge, but it\u2019s precisely this: It\u2019s going from \u201CI hold this position on Medicare, they hold that one,\u201D to \u201Cthey want to destroy Medicare.\u201D Right? And I wonder if when I heard the two of you talking earlier on about the importance of personal respect, how even when the two of you for all these years were on different sides of the issues, you had that respect for each other. Which is nice language but, you know, I\u2019m not sure how compelling it is or how you can see that as politically powerful. But if you see that what happens if you don\u2019t have that respect \u2014 I mean, what\u2019s behind that is that you might question each other\u2019s positions, but you would never question the character or the motivation of the person on the other side. One example of what\u2019s happened in Washington, and Pete knows this better than I do, back a few years ago, members of Congress lived here, socialized with each other. You bet. Their kids played on the same soccer team. Their wives knew each other, or their husbands. And it\u2019s a lot harder to go out and say, \u201CThis person is a bad person\u201D as opposed to \u201CI disagree with their position\u201D if you actually know each other and socialize together. And that has diminished greatly in the Congress. You\u2019re absolutely right. Let me cite for everybody here an example in my own life. I had an opportunity to meet once a week with five U.S. senators \u2014 three from the Democratic Party, two from the Republican Party \u2014 and two non-members. We would meet once a week for lunch. Our purpose was religious. We were talking about something that was personal to us about the Bible. And we would meet, eat, and did we ever get to know each other in terms of friendship. We became fast friends through this. So much so, that everything that I did in the Senate, I looked for a bipartisan helper and I would always look for a bipartisan helper that was a friend. And if we could get together, and it was instant contact, we could make beautiful music. I tell you, it was important that we know each other and whatever can be done to tell the institutions of this country make your institutions more habitable for the elected officials and their families so they get to be a little bit intimate. So you\u2019re talking about Senator Nunn to your wife and you talk about Sam and she knows who Sam is. You wouldn\u2019t dare go to the floor of the Senate and say anything about him other than I don\u2019t agree with him. And he could be right but I\u2019m just not on the same side and I\u2019m going to try to convince you he\u2019s wrong. But he\u2019s a terrific guy. Watch, listen, and download this conversation with Alice Rivlin and Pete Domenici at onbeing.org/ccp. This is the fourth and final in this season of our Civil Conversations Project. We\u2019ve been subverting deep divides in American life, which only become more polarizing in an election season. A great group of policy centers are joining us: the Humphrey School of Public Affairs and the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics, along with the Brookings Institution. Learn more, and add your voice, your questions, and your ideas. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org/ccp. On Twitter, find hashtag CCP2012. And I\u2019m on Twitter: @KristaTippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a rare public dialogue of candor and wisdom for this economic and political moment. I\u2019m at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., with two esteemed \u201CPolitical Bridge People\u201D \u2014 veteran Democratic economist Alice Rivlin and longtime Republican Senator Pete Domenici. They\u2019ve been talking about how the demise of human relationship \u2014 good, old-fashioned friendship \u2014 has altered the American political process. So I guess the question is, I mean, I always get a little bit nervous, because we\u2019re hearing this a lot. To me, the question is how can those human relationships be recreated? Probably not by everyone becoming Facebook friends but some 21st-century version. One thing I find encouraging is that I\u2019ve gone out around the country with various groups that were polling representative groups of citizens together in the same room. These are not people that are lifelong friends; they\u2019ve been chosen at random from lists and invited to come and spend a few hours working on a problem. In my case, it was the budget problem if I was involved with it. And actually, if people sit around a table and talk and they get to know each other and they say where are you from and where are you from and what do you do, the respect grows rather quickly. And the encouraging thing is when you sit quite average citizens down from different walks of life and give them the facts, as Pete was saying earlier \u2014 help them understand here\u2019s the problem and here are some options and things you might do \u2014 they come up with very sensible centrist solutions. It\u2019s not that hard. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s really pretty simple arithmetic. And people can do this. It isn\u2019t beyond human capacity. Hmm. Now, let me just add to what I said. Go ahead. Point number one: It would be good if members of the United States Senate could become friends. Now, that\u2019s on its own separate \u2026 And you don\u2019t mean Facebook friends. Right. No, I mean real friends. Right. I don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re good too. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to chastise anybody. But what I\u2019m talking about, there\u2019s one kind. But there\u2019s also friends that are born in the threshold of this problem. Right. And what\u2019s necessary there is an agreement as to what the facts are. We\u2019ve got to go from the citizen who is jibbering and jabbering about how bad these Congress people are to a chair to that person with somebody she would \u2014 she or he would trust and try to get them to believe something, some part of this problem. Maybe that we\u2019ve got a problem. That would be a step for some. Right. And then it\u2019s got to be solved. That might be some and that there are people trying to solve it who are not cheats and thieves and dumb bums. I think more and more people are beginning to get this, that the serious problem in the future is the debt of our country. What does it feel like \u2014 I think it\u2019s happened to the two of you, that because of these bipartisan activities, you\u2019ve been deemed to be traitors by people in your own parties. What\u2019s that experience like? And what has that taught you also about the hardness of this? I can certainly attest to that, traitorous me. No, traitor is not too strong a word. I have Democratic colleagues and friends, some of them right here at the Brookings Institution, who think that I am betraying the cause by working with Republicans and working in a bipartisan combination. And of course, on the Simpson-Bowles Commission, I got a lot of mail because that was a public thing. And most of my hate mail \u2014 and there was hate mail \u2014 was from the radical left. I am sure that the Republicans got the same kind of mail from the radical right. But the radical right wasn\u2019t interested in me; it was the radical left that thought I was betraying the cause. Mm-hmm. I want to zero in on the language of civility, which is a word that we\u2019re using for this project but it\u2019s a word that also makes me uncomfortable. You know, it\u2019s a little overused and it has connotations of mildness and niceness. You know, can it be a powerful enough force to really make a difference in this kind of really historic difficulty we\u2019re in. The two of you, through your experiences working together on this plan, but also in all of your decades, you know, when civility is a real, robust, effective thing even in hard political moments, what are the qualities it has? What does it do? How does it work? I think one quality is you have to listen to the other person and try to figure out what they\u2019re really saying. And we seem to be losing that ability to listen. And you have to get them to explain why they think what they think. I teach at Georgetown University and I taught a course this year that I invented last spring called Decision Making in a Polarized Environment. And I decided, after talking to my students, that they were mostly Democrats \u2014 not all \u2014 and mostly liberals and that it would be good if I got one of my really conservative friends, my friend Alison Fraser from the Heritage Foundation, to come. And I started by asking questions in your manner about how she got to the positions that she holds and then let the class in on it. I think they came away with a very different idea of how a real conservative thinks. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Actually, I think one of the most powerful and revealing questions you can ask is, \u201CWhat do you mean when you say that?\u201D You know, even when somebody uses a piece of vocabulary, to ask, \u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D Senator Domenici, when you think about civility as a robust and powerful thing, what is it? What are its components? Well, it seems to me it\u2019s really an interesting phenomenon, democracy, and it requires certain things. And if you can\u2019t listen to those who disagree without becoming yourself bombastic and irrational, then this system has a hard time succeeding. And we\u2019ve succeeded for a couple hundred years, but, you know, we want to succeed for a long time so we can be in the textbooks with the real longtime societies that lasted a couple thousand years. That won\u2019t happen if you end up hating \u2014 which I have to talk about if I\u2019m asking to talk about civility. If you end up being a hater and hating, you end up either taking a big chunk out of democracy or a small little piece out. And either way, you are really hurting this thing called democracy when you act the way some are now. I would urge that citizens who are frustrated about their government not retain the position that the politicians are the bad guys and the crooks, but rather, try to see what the problems are, see what the facts are. And to do that, you\u2019re going to have to open your ears a little bit and decide that you\u2019ve got to listen. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CPolitical Bridge People.\u201D We\u2019re at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. I\u2019m with Pete Domenici, former Republican Senator of New Mexico, and Alice Rivlin, a veteran economist who served in numerous Democratic administrations. Together they co-chaired the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Debt Reduction Task Force. So you two have been through many different chapters of American economic history. I wonder if you think that there is something in the nature of this moment, this crisis, that is making the politics of resolving it harder. And what I think of when I hear you talk about hatred, right, or not listening, there\u2019s just \u2014 there\u2019s so much fear out there. How do you think about that? How the particular nature of this economic downturn and the mess we\u2019re in now is shaping that political crisis. Which I think is how people feel, that there is a political crisis as well as an economic crisis. Well, I think they\u2019re right. There is a political crisis in that we have not been able to make progress solving some major problems like the budget, like climate change, like a bunch of others because we are so gridlocked and so polarized. But I think you\u2019re absolutely right that fear and playing upon that fear in order to get elected is a big part of the problem. And do you see it as more of a dynamic than in previous times? Well, it depends what previous times you mean. Yeah. I mean, we\u2019ve had \u2014 this is the worst downturn, the economy, the financial crisis of \u201908 and the recession that followed it the worst we\u2019ve had since the Great Depression but nothing like as bad as the Great Depression. Mm-hmm. That was a time of terrible fear and terrible hardship, and we\u2019re much better off now than we were then. So it\u2019s a little hard to understand why people are so susceptible to the fearmongering, but they are. Yeah. I don\u2019t know how to explain it excepting I would very much like to urge that people do everything they can to not make this an insolvable problem. You mean just not even in our imaginations decide that it\u2019s insolvable. Yeah. The people should have confidence and hope and faith that we\u2019re going to get something solved and work towards that, rather than the negative side. A democracy needs participation so it needs some hatemongers, I guess. We wouldn\u2019t survive without them. But what we end up needing is confidence in the system and looking for the good part. And that\u2019s a hard thing for a politician to ask of the public. I\u2019m not running for anything so I can say it. Mm-hmm. I do think I myself have ended up from time to time thinking that this is such a terrible economic time that we won\u2019t solve it, and then I turn myself around and go to work on it and say, well, it\u2019s just tough and that\u2019s because we\u2019re complicated and we\u2019re powerful. And so it\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s solvable. I\u2019m getting more confident because more people are joining the cause of trying to solve it. I agree with that. I think one thing that we seem to have forgotten is the nature of our Constitution. It requires compromise because we built into the Constitution, our forefathers 200-some years ago, a lot of protections against majorities running amok. So we have all of these checks and balances, and you can\u2019t get to a solution on anything really important under our Constitution unless you\u2019re willing to compromise. And compromise has become sort of a dirty word. Right. A reviled word, yeah. Like it was a bad thing, to compromise. Yeah. I think we have to understand compromise is a good thing, and it requires people giving up things that they would otherwise support. And we have to learn to live with the institutions that we have because they were set up for good reasons. I wrote down this Alan Simpson\u2019s definition of politics. And of course, he\u2019s another one of these bridge people now and your budget plan is part of that other constellation. He wrote: \u201CIn politics there are no right answers, only a continuing flow of compromises among groups resulting in a changing, cloudy, and ambiguous series of public decisions where appetites and ambition compete openly with knowledge and wisdom.\u201D That\u2019s a good quote from Alan. That was a quote from Alan Simpson. But, you know, I think what citizens are longing for more is more of that knowledge and wisdom piece hanging out with the ambiguity and the compromise and the ambition. So as we draw to a close, I want to just ask you a couple more questions along a little more personal lines \u2014 personal and political. So one of the people I\u2019ve been talking to for this Civil Conversations project is Frances Kissling, who\u2019s a longtime abortion rights activist. But she\u2019s dedicated the last few years of her life to being in a real relationship with her political opposites. And she\u2019s named a couple of questions that she feels must be asked at some point in real dialogue: Have there been moments where you could consider what you have found attractive in the position of the other and where you could also bring to the table what troubled you in your own position? And that being a fruitful, fruitful reflection. Yes, I think so. The problem I struggle with most as a Democrat \u2014 I think it\u2019s a very general problem \u2014 most of us believe in personal responsibility. We believe it for ourselves. We believe it for our kids. We believe people should take charge of their lives. And yet we also believe, in both personal and political space, in community responsibility for people who aren\u2019t making it. And the really difficult thing is the trade-off at that margin. And I like to think of it in personal terms. When you\u2019re bringing up teenagers, you have to think all the time, do we let them get out there and make their own mistakes so they\u2019ll learn? Or do we try to help them do the right thing? Mm-hmm. And there\u2019s never any very clear answer to that. You do some of both and hope for the best. Right. But the idea that help for low-income people or help to go to college or that sort of thing is going to make people dependent seems to me a wrong idea. On the other hand, the idea that there are no limits to the amount that we should help people is also a wrong idea. And you have to get the compromise that\u2019s workable. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m going to tell you fits the question. Something that Republicans do that bothers you. Oh. Well, in my party, we have an awful lot of good people that run for office and they get elected and I\u2019m proud of that. Lots of good governors \u2014 great ones, in fact. I do get bothered by their position on taxes when they, say, sign up with the gentleman that says he\u2019ll never have another new tax. I think that position is irresponsible and it also doesn\u2019t permit us to get things done because it polarizes instead of centralizing. And that\u2019s one of the worst that we\u2019ve got. So finally, Alice Rivlin, you\u2019ve called economics the science of hard choices. I wasn\u2019t the first to say that. You weren\u2019t the first. OK. It\u2019s a good definition. There\u2019s a sense in which, you know, the language of budgets is like dropping bombs from 50,000 feet. It feels like that. But you are people who are making those budgets, working on them, and you\u2019re doing that as policymakers and as people. So right now one of the most controversial areas of all of these plans is what happens with Medicare and Medicaid. Long-term care is a huge issue. Both of you are 80 years old. Is that right? Are you 80 also? I\u2019m 81. You\u2019re 81. Magnificently. I\u2019m 80. You\u2019re 80. He\u2019s just a kid. So I wonder how the human side of this for you comes into this and do you reckon with this on a human level even as you\u2019re working with these numbers. No? You mean on a personal level. No. No. Because neither of us are in danger of being in desperate need. Yeah. Or our families. And we also understand the problem well enough to know that nothing on the table at the moment is going to endanger seniors in a serious way, especially not in Medicare. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really relevant. But let me say the personal skills make a difference and I want to tell a story about Pete. Mm-hmm. We got into a controversy in our commission at one point. And we were co-chairing and I was sitting there at the table thinking this is in danger of falling apart. But then the politician with whom I was working said, \u201CLet\u2019s call a recess and have some coffee.\u201D I don\u2019t know actually what he did. He got some of the members over in a corner. I suspect what he said is, we\u2019ve got to get back to making this work and what would it take to get you onboard or something like that. But in any case, so they came back and the atmosphere was entirely different. That was the experience of the old chairman coming into play. And you have to have some skills of bringing people together to make these kinds of things work. And I think you\u2019re saying taking them out of the policy discussion, having the coffee, talking together as human beings and coming back \u2026 Yeah. It worked. Well, it worked because these were amicable people. They really wanted to do something for their country and they just had to be told that it was fix it right now or we ain\u2019t going to get anything. And they had to be told that. Is that what you want, all of you? It\u2019s going to fall apart. If you want to give a little and want me to take back something but you can\u2019t be what he and he and he is or we\u2019re gone. So let\u2019s sit down here and have a cup of coffee and let\u2019s talk about do we want to do something or not. And we got an answer, yes, we want to do something. So you\u2019ve got to do it that way. That\u2019s the first premise, that we want to do something. Now that means you\u2019ve got to change something because the way you are saying you want to go won\u2019t fit the definitions we require. I mean, we go outside the circle. So we\u2019ve got to get it back in. And we talked long enough to come back in. And we weren\u2019t on tune but we were close enough to argue amicably with the full group. Maybe that\u2019s how we got it done. So between you, you raised 13 children and I don\u2019t know how many grandchildren. Most were his. Yeah. Like eight are his. How do you talk to your grandchildren, great-grandchildren about this? What questions do they ask and what do you have to say to them as they think about their economic future? Oh, I\u2019m very pleased that I have grandchildren \u2014 young adults now \u2014 who are very interested in these issues and are able to talk about them sensibly and constructively. But do they ask questions that surprise you? Do they bring a new perspective that \u2026 Yes. \u2026 makes you think differently? What? How? Yes, I think so. I think young people today, a lot of young adults, are very turned off about politics. They\u2019re much more tuned into community action of various sorts. They volunteer. Although that\u2019s not true of one of my grandsons. He\u2019s quite interested in the political system. Mm-hmm. What do you say to your children? What wisdom do you have to impart to them about their economic future? I don\u2019t know why \u2014 we\u2019re not doing the job too well, I guess. They don\u2019t seem to talk to me about that. I mean, they\u2019re way too busy. If you\u2019d see what they\u2019re doing, you\u2019d say, well, you\u2019ve got to keep it going so they can keep doing what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s what your answer would be. Right. And that\u2019s the way I feel. I\u2019ve got to keep this country going because these kids and grandkids are doing such incredible things. I wouldn\u2019t want that to disappear and there be nothing for them to do. Right? So that\u2019s how I feel about it. And I don\u2019t want you to think there\u2019s not personal relationship but they are busy in their own lives and doing their own things and getting educated. Some of them just seem to never finish school, Alice. There\u2019s still another one working on doctor\u2019s degree. I thought it was over with, but she\u2019s still there. Oh, I would echo that. I mean, I think that the point of everything that Peter and I are working on is a better country for everybody\u2019s children and grandchildren, and I\u2019m actually very heartened, not just by my own descendants, but by the students that I teach and come in contact with as I go around to universities. There are an awful lot of bright, dedicated young people in this country and that, I think, is very encouraging. OK. Well, thank you, Alice Rivlin, Pete Domenici. Thank you all for coming.
