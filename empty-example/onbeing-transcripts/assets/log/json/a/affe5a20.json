  "fullText": "I love finding extraordinary people, well-known in their fields but hidden from many of the rest of us. Learning about such people, hearing from them, can shift our own world a little bit on its axis. Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya is a world-renowned painter who trained as a physicist. A philosopher\u2019s questioning and a physicist\u2019s eye shape his original approach to art and to life. One critic has described his art as an effort \u201Cto discern a deeper order that underlies what is obscured by the appearances of disorder.\u201D\u00A0Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya poetically speaks of the \u201Cwhisper\u201D of the order of things. He says that works of art that speak to humanity across time possess their own form of consciousness and that a quiet life of purpose is a particular form of prophecy. There\u2019s a tendency for us to think that to be a prophet or to do anything grand, you have to have a special gift, be someone called for. And I think ultimately what really matters is the resolve \u2014 to want to do it, to give your life to that which you consider important. And if you have no skills to offer or nothing special to offer, it\u2019s all the more amazing that you do it, the more remarkable. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya\u2019s art has been exhibited around the world, from the Hermitage in Moscow to a collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic. He grew up in Cuba, Spain, and Puerto Rico. He studied engineering, physics, and quantum electronics at Cornell and Berkeley before leaving science for art. I spoke with him at a live event at Biola University in La Mirada, California. I met with some faculty today and talked about how I run into really interesting people from Biola all over the place. I very much value this place and its tradition of faith and intellect, hand-in-hand. And so I\u2019m thrilled to be here tonight and thrilled to have Enrique with me as my conversation partner. So let\u2019s just plunge right in. You were born in a small town in Cuba into the socialism there of the 1960s. That\u2019s a really interesting time and place to be born. Also, that socialism was officially atheist. I wonder how you would describe the religious and spiritual background of your childhood there. : Cuba was probably the least religious country in Latin America, even before the revolution. And by 1964, when I was born, there were no churches. Our churches were not really part of the community. My parents, though, held onto their Catholic God, even though it played very little role into our lives. Most of the Cubans I knew were into Santer\u00EDa or Espiritismo, which were other traditions. And sort of the magic of that made the challenges of communism, the migration, and all of that, more \u2014 in some ways, more manageable for people. But then after that, I went to Spain, which is a little different, and Puerto Rico. Right. And how old were you when you left Cuba? I was seven. OK, so you were quite young, but it also is interesting for me to think about living in a time and place when revolution was a living idea. I mean do you think that imprinted you, even at that young age? Oh, yeah. I mean definitely. I mean this was a time that the revolution was \u2014 there were so many problems that we were facing because of the shortage of many things. But it\u2019s still the idea that this big change has happened around us. There was a certain utopian feeling floating in the society, still. And it was hard not to get touched by that, as a kid, even though my parents themselves were against the revolution. But I\u2019m \u2014 I was intrigued by it. Yeah, it was hugely aspirational. It was. It was, even for the little town we lived in. I think many people still felt that things were possible. Right. You then grew up and seemed to be becoming a physicist. And what I\u2019ve read is that you went on a five-day retreat in the winter of 1990 at Pigeon Point Lighthouse, and it was after that that you left physics for art. So tell us what happened there. Yeah. It was a crisis. Did you know you were in crisis when you went there? Yeah. That\u2019s why. So physics had been my life, in many ways. I was interested in literature and painting since I was very young, but physics and mathematics were the most exciting things for me. And when I was a teenager, I had this sense that they were going to give me the answer to these questions. I always felt that I didn\u2019t understand enough about the world and physics. Did you invent a laser in Puerto Rico in high school? I did. I did. And I worked in a research lab, and then I built this laser. And it was very exciting. And I worked on a nuclear accelerator later at Cornell; then I worked at a place called Brookhaven. And I was really destined to do that for my life. But as I got older, when I got to Berkeley, I was painting all the time, and what I wanted to do was paint. And it got to the point that I really had that crisis. I felt like I had to make a choice.\u00A0And I went to this lighthouse. I drove down from Berkeley to this lighthouse and ensconced myself in the little house there for five days. And when I came out, I drove back to San Francisco knowing I would be an artist, although I didn\u2019t know what that meant. So I worked as a scientist. I dropped out of the doctorate program \u2014 I was doing the doctorate and MFA at Berkeley at the same time. I dropped out of both and worked as a scientist, trying to build enough money to be able to do things, designing lasers.\u00A0And then I moved to Oakland and sold my works in the parks in San Francisco, trying to figure out what was next. And that was a terrible time. A terrible time? Yeah, yeah. My parents were distraught. I was the oldest in the family. We had been immigrants, quite poor in Spain, and so on. And I have always done well in school, and the promise was that I was going to be a successful person, and here I was having a crazy dream. Although supporting your art habit by building lasers is still more impressive than supporting your art habit by being a waiter or something. Yeah, it was odd to say to people what I did with my day job. But it also took some credibility out of me being an artist. When I would say, \u201CWell I\u2019m an artist, but I\u2019m also a physicist,\u201D it seemed always like it was a hobby. It seems to me, though, that the scientist in you is very much alive in you, in your approach and philosophy of art, in the way you \u2014 and in your art. Yeah, you\u2019re right. It is. It is alive, even though sometimes people don\u2019t realize it. I think that one of the most important ways in which it\u2019s alive is the treatment I have towards my studio. I approach it not as a factory, which has become very much the way of artists looking at the studios in the last 40 or 50 years, but rather as a laboratory, as a cross between laboratories and a monastery, that kind of hybrid place. Also, the process of inquiry that I use for my work owes a lot to my training as a scientist. How\u2019s that? When I take on a new project, rather than building upon the successes of the past or what I have done before, I go back to the holes of my process, the things that I didn\u2019t understand well. And I go into those. And I find that that\u2019s a very typical thing of scientists to do. I also try to be rigorous and unfriendly towards my own biases and assumptions. And I think I also owe that to physics. My interest in philosophy, I think, comes from physics. And finally, and this is maybe the most important of all the reasons, I think the arts have become extremely apologetic to the sciences, partly because science has been so successful over the last 200 years. So I think in many \u2014 many of my experiences with academic art and art theory has been the tendency to want to be scientific \u2014 or pseudoscientific. And when I came to art, I came to art without apologies. And that gave me a great deal of freedom. There\u2019s even a way that you\u2019ve described painting that evokes that for me, the craft of it, or even the way you understand what\u2019s going on. You talked about \u2014 though, as an observer, we\u2019d see painting as something that is happening on a surface with materials \u2014 you said, \u201Cin an interesting painting, images fight back, and their meanings play hide-and-go-seek with materials.\u201D That is such an interesting \u2014 I mean that image is going to change the way I look at any painting from here on out. Well, I mean I think paintings are odd, in the sense that it seems to us that everything that is important is on the surface and visible. Unlike, say, science: we expect that we have to go in deep to understand what\u2019s really at play in an equation or something. But that\u2019s very deceiving. I think paintings have a complexity, a relationship to presence and reference in the work of art, the tension between what seems to be and what is. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with philosopher and artist Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya. What are you working on right now? Just to tie these ideas to a specific project. So I\u2019m working on a body of work that opens next month in New York; or I just finished it. And pointing to \u2014 just before, I did a show called \u201CEmpires\u201D that looked at ambitions and illusions, in some manner. And now I\u2019m looking at the aftermath of that, what happens after those ambitions have been played out. So I want to talk about some passions and themes that run through your work and through your thinking and writing, the idea of empires. You have this phrase \u2014 \u201Cthe dialectical friction between the domestic and the epic.\u201D I don\u2019t know if you said that in the context of \u201CEmpires.\u201D But I mean here\u2019s something you wrote. You wrote that despite \u2014 you had an early interest in classic empires like Rome \u2014 \u201CThe empires that matter most to me now are the smaller empires of day-to-day living constructed by promises and shaped by our drive, our accomplishments, and our failures. These are big and small empires built around our hopes and around our scorns, empires of place as well as of memory, of today in the land and of tomorrow in the sea.\u201D Yeah. I was going through a big transformation in my life when I took on this project of \u201CEmpires.\u201D And I got into this big argument with a Dartmouth professor, what empires are. But my empires with this \u2014 these empires that I saw growing up, through my mother\u2019s dressers or the dust on top of some book, these kinds of empires that \u2014 one of the qualities they have is a sort of failure built in, certain futility in the adventure of those ambitions. And that dialectic that you spoke about, between the epic and the domestic \u2014 I think artists are usually artists of the epic or artists of the domestic. But what I am interested in is the friction between these two spheres: the domestic spheres of our everyday lives \u2014 children, families \u2014 are sort of a small goal, so to speak; and these larger movements of time and history and God, these kinds of larger ideas. And the two of them rub against each other; and that friction between the domestic and the epic is a source of a lot of my work. So what I\u2019m interested in is always sort of the small \u2014 the small breakings, the small fractures. At risk of stretching this too far, I feel like that friction is so much with us now. And I think national, political level, but also globally. It feels epic, and it feels connected to our lives, and yet it\u2019s hard to get a handle on that or to know how to be working with it. Yeah, I mean there\u2019s sometimes a tendency to speak in numbers, in terms of numbers or groups. And to me, everything always breaks down to the individual \u2014 individual suffering, individual failure. And no matter what group you belong to, I think that individuality of suffering and possibility and hope is the fundamental building block of human experience. And it is that \u2014 it is only to that \u2014 that art can say anything. Art can say very little about groups or general movements. And I think consciousness is \u2014 obviously, it\u2019s one of these epic things, but it runs \u2014 and it is the theme of philosophy. It\u2019s a special passion of yours, right? It\u2019s something that you write about and think about, and it makes its way into your art. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 I think it started when I was very young. I had this sense of \u2014 my own sense of lack, of missing, always feeling like there was too much fullness to the world, and I understood so little of it. And consciousness is at the center of that awareness. Not to go too far, because then this is a little bit of a rabbit hole, but there is a way to look at artworks as consciousness. Artworks? Rather than just be representatives or embodiments of a consciousness of the producer, they themselves having some consciousness: I guess animated, open engagement. There\u2019s nothing intelligent I can say about it other than a feeling that I have that this is the case. Tell me an example of you experiencing that with a piece of art. One of the most obvious examples, I think \u2014 and it happens to me every time I encounter any work by Van Gogh, no matter where it is, and the moment I see it, something happens. There\u2019s an intelligence at play in the work itself and a sense of something I can only describe as a consciousness in that work that engages me, forces me to be a witness, forces me to be a conversation partner, places me in a very unstable place. And there\u2019s an instability in that exchange that is more, simply, than just looking at a bunch of marks and thinking of how Vincent might have made them or something like that. And this is a rare thing, I think. But I will suggest that somewhere around that, one could construct the definition of what art is, as opposed to an art activity. It\u2019s when something has the capacity to embody consciousness in a way that it can be unfolded. Over hundreds of years. Over hundreds of years, yeah. Maybe this is what art is. And I think that\u2019s an interesting distinction too, that there are works of art that convey that, and there are \u2014 what did you say \u2014 art activities. Because every \u2014 I don\u2019t think you would say, either, that every painting has that consciousness or conveys\u2026 Yeah, I mean I think when you go to a museum, and you look around, most works are forever trapped in their moment in a way that they are completely historical. But then the great works of art are always ahistorical. Regardless of the historical condition, they speak to you in the present. Right. And that present-ness of the work of art is what I am suggesting brings about this engagement with consciousness. And those things are the work. Somewhere around there is that I would try to construct the definition of what art is. Yes. Another theme of yours that recurs is memory \u2014 memory and displacement. OK, so here\u2019s this poem, which \u2014 I think I saw it because you have these notebooks that accompany some of your works and exhibits, where you \u2014 and they get published. They\u2019re really fascinating if you have a chance to see them. They\u2019re handwritten, and it\u2019s basically the notes you take. It\u2019s basically a journal, right, a journal of the process. So I saw this written in one of those notebooks, with words crossed out, and then here it appears all neat and tidy on the page. \u201CIt was not time or circumstance that displaced your memory. It was concentration. Then the whole house filled with birds flapping their wings, shaping the air into snowballs of sound, which they threw against corners long ago left to silence.\u00A0The yard, abandoned to weeds, had the flowers of laughter. And the window flickered light over the porcelain fish, which, for all time, jumped from the dark crystal table.\u201D I\u2019m totally fascinated by \u201CIt was not time or circumstance that displaced your memory. It was concentration.\u201D And I have no idea what you\u2019re saying there. So please explain. I think that I find that sometimes, in my experience of some people and some events, the only way to move past them, the only way to survive them in some manner is with some sort of sometimes seemingly heroic effort, almost a practice of forgetfulness. That you have to every day wake up again and forget them again and forget them again until that practice of forgetting them becomes sort of your everyday thing. And that seemed like a love poem there that you read, but it was a poem to a moment of my childhood. And yeah, it was effort. It was a hard moment. It was a hard moment, not because something happened to me but because of the fullness of that moment and those conditions and everything that the world around it \u2014 the world and the people around them \u2014 the feelings of those things. It brings together a great deal of memories of departure and so on and who I was and who are the people around and required sustained effort to not sink into that place and never come back. And that\u2019s the thing with memories. That\u2019s the thing with certain circumstances \u2014 that they are so vast that if you don\u2019t keep swimming against that current, it will draw you back, and you will never recover. You can listen again and share this conversation with Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya, exploring his philosopher and painter\u2019s lens on the world we inhabit now. He\u2019s also a trained physicist. And I spoke with him at a live event at Biola University, an Evangelical institution with a reverence for intellectual rigor and the arts. A phrase that comes up in your writing and in what people write about you is this notion of \u201Chinge moments.\u201D And I think you just described that: standing before a Van Gogh painting. And actually I recently \u2014 just in Minnesota a week ago, I met a Biola alum who talked about standing in front of one your paintings. And essentially \u2014 she didn\u2019t use the phrase \u201Chinge moments,\u201D but she said, \u201CI stood there, and that changed me. I walked away, and I was different.\u201D And it seems to me that one of your projects that feels like it was important to you was your Berlin work, \u201CSchneebett,\u201D that you did for the Berlin Philharmonic, writing about \u2014 well, would you just \u2014 I mean it seems \u2014 it was about Beethoven\u2019s deathbed. But it was about a lot more than that. It\u2019s interesting, too, when you write about that period of Berlin. So that\u2019s mid-\u201990s Berlin. This was a period before the \u2014 so Germany had been reunited, but it was a period before the Bonn government relocated to Berlin. There were still bullet holes in a lot of those buildings in East Berlin, which was true when I was there as well. They\u2019d just never been repaired. So the past was just physically alive. And you wrote that this project considered the end of an \u2014 or that you were \u201Cin the midst of the end of an epoch and the consequences of displacement,\u201D that Berlin at that time \u201Csuggested a mood, a way of being which I had not understood before and still do not understand well.\u201D I wondered if you would say some more about that, because that feels like it was bigger, also, than that time, that place in time. I mean I think Berlin, at that time, had this sense of collective memory. It was just a whole city held together. In the windows, when you look up to those windows, you still feel that you can see that past in those windows. So in many ways, it was my own exploration of my exile \u2014 strangely enough, going to Germany to find it. But it was through that, through all those desolated houses of Berlin. At that time, really, it was \u2014 you felt that you were walking through a past that was still half-animated in some manner. Did it take you back to that 1960s socialist Cuba, in that sense? Oh, yeah, it did. It did. And it did in a way that by being unencumbered by my own specific history, I could see it with some distance. Yeah, and I have to say, that language is very resonant for me. I mean the end of epochs, the beginning of something that you can\u2019t quite understand, the consequences of displacement \u2014 that\u2019s very resonant language for this moment in the 21st century, I feel. I don\u2019t know. Do you think of it \u2014 and I feel like \u2014 as you say, the places you\u2019ve come from, the places you\u2019ve been, also, you have a certain perspective on that that can be useful. One of the consequences of being in exile is that in some ways \u2014 you gain the world in many ways. I feel that the freedom that comes with being an exile is to take all these different ways of looking at these problems of displacement and loss and then incorporate as my own, and without necessarily trying to tie it up to, specifically, the Cuban exile experience. But I do feel that this is a moment in which the conversation has been narrowed to sort of create this sort of simplistic opposition between \u201Clocals\u201D and \u201Cthe other.\u201D And I think that it\u2019s more complicated than that. I mean I think one of the things that I\u2019m most interested in is to find the strangeness in each of us. The strangeness. The strangeness, the sense of otherness in us. I mean I think that we all carry a burden of otherness, of not being a local, so to speak. And I think getting in touch with that will make this simplistic opposition disappear somewhat \u2014 or completely, if it we look at it closely enough. I\u2019d love to talk about religion and the term \u201Creligious,\u201D what that means for you. And I think, actually, where we are, it flows right into that. The way you use the term \u201Creligious,\u201D I see it connected to connotations of consciousness, also of an awareness of moral failings, of emotional ambition and seriousness. And I don\u2019t have a sense \u2014 this is not something that you overtly speak about or reckon with. So the religion of my childhood \u2014 I had a contentious relationship to that religion of my childhood. But even though I had a contentious relationship with it, it mattered to me. I want art to do what religion does for my parents and for people who are believers: a certain inquiry into truth, a certain clarifying force in one\u2019s life, a certain guide. And that\u2019s how I have approached it. And that\u2019s why I sometimes react when people ask me what the work is about. I mean nobody asks what religious experience is about. Right. They just \u2014 if they ask something, it\u2019s: \u201CHow does it come about?\u201D And I think \u2014 I find, sort of like Wittgenstein, that even though I am myself not religious, I look at life from a religious point of view, that the questions that people usually address in religion are the ones I want to think about and talk about, not only in my work, but in my work. I was \u2014 what was it. Oh, when we were talking earlier on about your idea of a painting, that there are meanings: \u201CImages fight back, and their meanings play hide-and-go-seek with materials.\u201D It seems to me that it\u2019s kind of a way to move through the world, also: seeing meaning that is playing hide-and-seek with materials. As you say, that\u2019s you as an artist, but it\u2019s also \u2014 as you just said \u2014 it also describes a religious way of moving through the world. Yeah. Yeah, I mean and there is \u2014 there is a secret in all things. And that secret that is in everything, in my shoe and everything that there is, I think makes life and reality and the moment so full, so vast, that only the kinds of attitudes that people describe as religious attitudes have the possibility of approaching that fullness with any kind of sincerity and with any kind of possibility of getting anywhere. You sometimes say that artists should be prophets, and then you often qualify it and say, \u201Cminor prophets, at least.\u201D And I like the way you define that, because you don\u2019t define it as being mystical. You said \u2014 you actually did a lecture in 2009 called \u201CThe Prophet,\u201D and you drew on Pushkin and Kahlil Gibran, and you wrote, \u201CThe prophet is not a martyr or mystic who seeks transcendence, but one who turns humbly and curiously towards the world.\u201D I mean I think there is a tendency \u2014 not just in our moment; I mean Kierkegaard made the distinction between the apostle and the genius 170 years ago. But there\u2019s a tendency for us to think that to be a prophet or to do anything grand, you have to have a special gift, be someone called for. And I think ultimately what really matters is the resolve \u2014 to want to do it, to give your life to that which you consider important. And if you have no skills to offer, or nothing special to offer, it\u2019s all the more amazing that you do it, the more remarkable. And I think that resolve is all that really matters. And in the specific case of art, I think the notion that to bring the future forward by throwing yourself desperately \u2014 I think desperation is part of what I consider a prophet to have. Once you have made that resolve to launch yourself forward, then desperation is the only factor: urgency, desperation. There is no way to calculate. And the reason I made the distinction between minor prophet is because I\u2019m not trying to put any capital letters here or trying to say that you\u2019re going to be remembered as such, because it really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a private journey that no one needs to really know about. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with philosopher and artist Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya. You use the word \u201Cwhisper\u201D a lot \u2014 do you know that? \u2014 in your writing. I didn\u2019t know that. \u201CThe whisper of the order of things.\u201D And then you said somewhere, \u201CThe whisper is faint, but the best art helps us to hear it.\u201D Yeah, I mean I think the reason why I use \u201Cwhisper\u201D is because maybe \u2014 maybe I have little ears. But it seems that both in science and art and anything \u2014 in anything, the truth is not screaming that much. And I think that you have to be attentive, silent enough, be able to look and listen very, very carefully. And even then, you have to be very lucky to hear something. But when you do hear something, it\u2019s transformative. And that order of things, that more stable reality underneath the appearance of things, is life-changing. And I think scientists will say that\u2019s the case, and I think poets, and I think theologists \u2014 I mean I think everybody agrees that truth is \u2014 requires some suppressing of other things to see it. It\u2019s interesting to ponder that. And also because we\u2019re all so trained to be \u2014 really to be noisy, right, to raise our voices. And to think of truth, real truth, as something that will be whispering, and so that part of the way we have to let it into the world or attend to it is to be more quiet, more gentle. Yeah, I mean it doesn\u2019t lend itself naturally to many of what we hear in the culture as a whole. And I think we are challenged \u2014 and especially, I would say, even more so the younger. My kids are challenged by all of this, all these demands \u2014 to the point that to even talk about something that exists underneath all that, like a rustle of leaves or something, underneath that whole scandal\u2026 Or the whisper of the order of things. Or the whisper of the order of things. That is something that not only sounds foreign, but the kind of concentration \u2014 and also the kind of giving up of many of the things we hold dear and we have been taught to love and demand and wish for and crave \u2014 is a tall order. This is something kind of completely different, but we just have a few more minutes, and I do want to ask you about this. You \u2014 and I don\u2019t really know the story here, but it sounds like you moved \u2014 you\u2019ve kind of moved away from and towards color in your life, and that you\u2019ve kind of moved away from color and re-embraced it after the birth of your children, in a new way. Yeah, I mean I started as an apprentice for a painter, very traditional paintings. And in the late \u201980s, I destroyed all my paintings. I burned them, and I felt that \u2014 physically, I actually burned them. I felt like I had to build painting from the ground up. And I think eliminating color \u2014 I eliminated from my painting anything that anybody has ever said that I was good at. So if I was good at drawing, I took it out. If I was told I had facility with color, I took it out. And then I said, \u201CWell, if I give up all these things, what is painting, for me?\u201D So I\u2019m very interested in the idea of being anti-facile in some ways, rejecting what comes naturally or rejecting pleasure. So then I worked in black paintings for a long time \u2014 although black is so seductive, that in itself is a problem. Right. So it\u2019s too easy to be fetishistic about the rejection itself. So I was fortunate to have children. And when they came, along with them came the reinvention of a new way of working to make sure that I was not getting too comfortable in that other way. And then with them came color over tar paintings, of all things. And I still mute it; I cannot make a big, triumphant return to color, because it is relatively muted still. But it is there. I was thinking, when I read that \u2014 I interviewed, a few years ago, a physicist, Arthur Zajonc, who\u2019s worked a lot with Goethe, who we think of as a poet but in fact really thought of himself more as a scientist. And that he \u2014 that Goethe defined colors as \u201Cthe deeds and sufferings of light.\u201D Yeah, I mean all colors \u2014 I mean really, all colors are just basically \u2014 I mean light is the same thing, whether it\u2019s a red or a green. Just slight shifts will make one into the other, depending on how you move and speed and so on. But yeah, I mean \u2014 my kids are very interested in color, and they ask me all the time about them, and they cannot believe that I think brown is a nice color, for example. This is why we have children. They set us straight. But I think that there\u2019s an emotional relationship that colors can bring about, and paintings are intricately connected to the notion of not absolute color, but local color; colors in relationship with one another. And I find this to be a profound part of the encounter with paintings. And the colors of paintings are always insignificant, or relatively lame, compared to nature. A lot of the great things of paintings is the constraints, the limitations. I mean that\u2019s what makes them a creative enterprise; it\u2019s the constraints. A lot of people talk about art as freedom when, in fact, it is the constraints that allow the possibility of art to happen. And color constrained under the pressures of these relatively small dimensions is beauty under compression, which is always an exuberant form of beauty. This is a final detour, but you have such an interesting view of \u2014 and you wrote about this \u2014 about photography, and you wrote about this a lot in your Berlin experience. And it strikes me because now, and for people in this generation and our children, photography is something \u2014 it\u2019s a momentary activity. It\u2019s almost synonymous with seeing, taking a picture. And you talked about \u2014 here \u201Cwhisper\u201D is again. \u201CPhotographs whisper that to look at them is to lose or overhear something,\u201D that \u201Cthe chemistry of photography holds grief as a potential.\u201D I just think this is so interesting, to think about memory and mourning, that there\u2019s so much going on in pictures. So much more meaning than we attribute now. Yeah, I mean I think that when people look at, say, a portrait of somebody, we always think that what we\u2019re saying is, \u201CThat person is no longer.\u201D But in fact, it\u2019s the other way. It\u2019s us that do not exist for that photograph. Oh. And as such, there is a grief, a mourning of the loss of \u2014 always built into a photograph. On my painting table, I have a photograph of Robert Frost with his son, Carol. And Carol, many years after that photograph \u2014 in the photograph, Carol is maybe 13. Many years later, Carol committed suicide. And I have that photograph with two apples from Robert Frost\u2019s orchard on my painting table. And I look at it every day, and I think: That photograph knew everything that was to come, sort of in the leaning of Carol toward his father \u2014 the future was there. And I look at it every day to figure out if I can catch it, and which part of it. So then, three inches away, I have a picture of my son and I. It\u2019s still unfolding. And I\u2019m trying to understand how that photograph, who tells me that I don\u2019t exist for it, is holding all that will be in its place. And I think that\u2019s what photographs can do, in some ways. And like many other things, by taking so many photographs, by having them in our phones, we don\u2019t look at them carefully enough. And in fact, they have become sort of a testament of having lived, when in fact what photographs do is say: You\u2019re no longer. This is too deep for 9:00 PM. So a simple \u2014 actually, a ridiculous question to end. But the question is really how you would start answering this question of \u2014 through the life you\u2019ve lived and the work you do, the way you walk through the world as a scientist/artist/philosopher, how would you start to answer the question how you think now about what it means to be human, how your sense of that has evolved to this \u2014 at this point? I think the thing that is most pressing that comes up when you ask that question is compassion. I think \u2014 not because it comes naturally but because it doesn\u2019t, to me. And I find that at this age, with four kids and with a world that everywhere one turns \u2014 and not just in the news, in just about every encounter with every \u2014 every person is carrying something. And I think what I\u2019m reminded constantly is, to be human is to be aware of that, more than intelligence, more than anything else. And it\u2019s increasingly urgent and increasingly hard to remember that. I like how you describe it also not as a quality but as a work in progress. Yeah, it is a work in progress. This morning I was seeing a man eating from a garbage can halfway between Brentwood and Bel Air, two expensive neighborhoods of L.A., and everybody driving by and so on. And I was thinking, what will it take for somebody to stop and do something about it? But nobody did. And I didn\u2019t. And I think that our familiarity with those images and our capacity to survive them, to move on, is remarkable to me. Do you consider yourself to be a hopeful person? Is hope a word you use? I don\u2019t \u2014 I think hope is in some ways a heroic human quality, especially in light of what life sometimes brings. But perhaps it\u2019s the best thing we have, to have the heroism of waking up in the morning, brushing our teeth, and saying that something will be possible. That being said, I don\u2019t describe myself as hopeful. I think hope is another of those works in progress. For some people, it seems amazing that they can sustain hope against atrocities and oppression and so many horrible things. But it\u2019s also amazing when people are hopeful when they have a menial job they hate or a terrible family life and then somehow still have this remarkable human capacity to still think that tomorrow will be better. There is a certain wonderful thing \u2014 and also a terrifying thing, a denial of the present \u2014 that comes with hope. And sometimes that\u2019s the only thing we have. But I turn that one around constantly in my head. Well, Enrique Mart\u00EDnez Celaya, thank you so much for this conversation. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
