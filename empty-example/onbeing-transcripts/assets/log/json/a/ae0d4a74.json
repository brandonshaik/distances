  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith, conversation on belief, meaning, issues and ideas. Today, \u201CWork and Conscience.\u201D We\u2019ll explore some practical implications of spirituality at work with syndicated columnist Tim McGuire. But first, FBI special agent Coleen Rowley. In May 2002, Coleen Rowley wrote a now-famous 13-page letter to the chief executive officer of her place of work, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She meant it to be a private letter, but it was leaked to the press and within weeks Coleen Rowley found herself testifying before Congress. She had raised serious and painstakingly detailed concerns about how the FBI had handled leads prior to 9/11. I do want to welcome special agent Coleen M. Rowley of the FBI. She came to the attention of this committee when she wrote a letter to Director Mueller that was given to members of Congress\u2026 Agent Rowley is a patriotic American who had the courage to put truth first and raise critical but important questions about how the FBI handled a terrorist case. Agent Rowley, your testimony today is a great service to this committee, the entire Congress, the FBI\u2026 The first thing I want to do is thank you for the opportunity to appear today. I never really anticipated this kind of impact when I wrote this letter to Director Mueller two weeks ago. In the final paragraph of her letter, almost as an afterthought, this mother of four asked for protection under federal whistle-blower provisions, and it is as a whistle-blower, one of three named Time magazine persons of the year, that she will go down in history. But Coleen Rowley wears the label `whistle-blower\u2019 uncomfortably. She is by all accounts a woman who loves her work. Since September 11th, 2001, and into the present, she has been examining her own deepest motivations and become a counselor and role model for others. Coleen Rowley agreed to speak with me for this program about her personal experience, not in her professional capacity or on behalf of the FBI. I wanted to hear how her thoughts on conscience have developed, and to consider what the high-profile courage of this plain-spoken woman might have to do with the rest of us in other fields of work. I was also curious about whether there\u2019s a spiritual side to her. I began by asking how she became an FBI agent \u2014\u00A0why this is work she can refer to as a calling. It all started when she was 11 years old, watching the television series the \u201CMan from U.N.C.L.E.\u201D There was a column in our newspaper that answered questions about television shows, so I wrote to this newspaper and I said, `When I grow up I want to join U.N.C.L.E., and then they wrote back in the paper and said, `Well, U.N.C.L.E. is a fictional entity. They\u2019re the good guys fighting against evil spies. But in the United States, we have something similar called the FBI,\u2019 and then they gave me the address and then I turned around and wrote the letter to the FBI. At the time, they sent me this `99 facts about the FBI\u2019 and one of the questions in the `99 facts\u2019 was: Why can\u2019t women become FBI agents? Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, and then there was a very elaborate, contrived response about how the job was too difficult and demanding, and you had to be able to dominate the situation. I can\u2019t quite remember it all, but it was very creative writing exercise. And I remember even at that age, when I was like fifth or sixth grade, I read this and said, `Oh, how stupid. That\u2019ll change by the time I grow up.\u2019 And of course, it did. FBI special agent Coleen Rowley. On September 11th, 2001, she had been an FBI agent for 20 years, from Minnesota to New York City to London. She was serving at that time as legal counsel in the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis bureau. She and her colleagues watched the twin towers fall with a special burden of regret. For many months, they had been pushing FBI Washington, DC, headquarters without success to allow them to investigate Zacarias Moussaoui, now the only suspect to be facing trial in this country for the 9/11 hijackings. Moussaoui aroused the concerns of a flight instructor after paying thousands of dollars in cash to take a flight simulator course for a Boeing 747. FBI agents in Rowley\u2019s office followed the lead and turned him over to immigration authorities on a visa violation. FBI headquarters claimed the Minneapolis bureau had insufficient probable cause even to request a search of his laptop. The laptop, it later transpired, contained files on crop dusting and commercial flight simulations. Coleen Rowley believed that an investigation of Moussaoui might have unraveled the 9/11 plot, and in the days following the attacks she became increasingly irate as she watched the FBI deny that there had been any leads that might have made a difference. She continues to disagree. Yeah, the sad thing, of course, is not only the fact of the 9/11 attacks but then everything that has almost seemed like a cascade \u2014\u00A0kind of a domino effect \u2014\u00A0-all of the various things that have happened since \u2014\u00A0to include the government investigations of 9/11, to include maybe even the Iraq war, the war on terrorism, all of the actions that have now been taken in that respect \u2014\u00A0these all have stemmed from those attacks. And to the extent that if you feel that you could have done anything more that might have stopped it, it puts a tremendous burden or a tremendous \u2014\u00A0it\u2019s just something that I would love to see this end. I would love to see the endless parade of things that are happening as a result of 9/11 \u2014\u00A0unfortunately, in a realistic sense, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. I think we\u2019re going to be dealing with the ramifications of 9/11 for a long, long time. And in my own responsibility for perhaps not having tried harder, it\u2019s greatly affected me. It\u2019s also affected everything I\u2019ve done since that time. Time magazine wrote that `When Rowley upbraided her beloved FBI in a secret 13-page memo, she thought she was on a private rescue mission. In her view, it was not a reprimand but an act of redemption.\u2019 Now that \u2014\u00A0that\u2019s a religious word, and I wonder if you would have used that kind of language, if that is the understanding you had. Well, what I\u2019ve thought about \u2014\u00A0I don\u2019t know if redemption is a bad term for it. I don\u2019t know if I would have used it. The term I used in my letter is learn from your mistakes. I think that the only positive thing that can come from mistakes \u2014\u00A0we all are making mistakes all the time, and of course, recrimination and guilt and all these other things are counterproductive. I even said in my letter, `I don\u2019t think we should go on a witch-hunt.\u2019 On the other hand, we do have to have accountability and we have to unravel when a mistake is made, kind of like the story \u201CThe Emperor Has No Clothes.\u201D The story about \u201CThe Emperor Has No Clothes\u201D is such an important thing because you get to the point where people realize the mistake, so in the story a little boy is saying, `You\u2019re \u2014\u00A0you\u2019re naked, Emperor,\u2019 but then what almost always happens in these situations is someone says, `Continue the parade. No one\u2019ll know. We can still pull it off.\u2019 And that\u2019s kind of where I think this redemption or whatever you want to term it comes in, because at that point you have to come clean. You have to figure out what went wrong and fix it. And the only way \u2014\u00A0I mean, even people with bad habits, like alcoholism and whatever, will always tell you you have to at first admit it. And once you admit it, you can begin the process of getting better. And you know what? You\u2019re describing a very pragmatic and practical \u2014\u00A0but it also has a fierce sort of moral determination behind it. Well, I suppose there\u2019s a lot of things \u2014\u00A0you know, \u2018course, we\u2019re all the product \u2014\u00A0we aren\u2019t born with these consciences. They develop over time, and I\u2019m sure when I was young, I can probably put my parents, my friends actually, my teachers \u2014\u00A0I grew up in a real strict school. Wasn\u2019t Catholic, but it was the next thing to it. We had teachers that were not tolerant at all of mistakes and misbehavior, etc. And at the time, we almost thought it was unfair; some of them were almost mean. But now, of course, all these years later, I realize that that had a great deterrent effect. It kept discipline in the school, and I\u2019m looking back at all these lessons. I had a teacher who gave me an F once for not putting my name on my paper. I mean, when I told this to a junior high class, they all awed in the room because they couldn\u2019t believe that that would happen. And of course, after that, guess what? I really learned to put my name on the paper. But that type of thing \u2014\u00A0church. I did go to church as it \u2014\u00A0growing up. I went every Sunday and I think all of these things kind of help you develop a conscience. Do you think there was a religious impulse in the stance you took after 9/11 in the FBI? I think actually I\u2019ve done more thinking since this all occurred. I think when they called me to testify, I couldn\u2019t sleep a couple of nights, and I\u2019m not quite sure I can even articulate what was going on there. But after the 9/11 and in talking now about the topic of integrity, and I\u2019ve had a chance \u2014\u00A0I haven\u2019t read really since joining the FBI \u2014\u00A0we don\u2019t have much time. We work 60-hour weeks, and I don\u2019t have the time to read books. But I have gotten so interested in this whole area that I have read three or four philosophical, some religious-based books \u2014\u00A0books about other notable people who in history have taken really tough stances. Well, tell me about some of the things you\u2019ve read and connected with. Well, the \u2014\u00A0couple of books. Fulton Sheen has a book called \u201CThe Cross and the Beatitudes\u201D that someone gave me after I talked about legal ethics, of all things. And I\u2019ve read this book and it\u2019s got profound things in it, of course. There\u2019s another one that I remember from my French major days called \u201CThe Fall\u201D by Albert Camus, and this is basically somebody who when you come up against \u2014\u00A0and everyone in life does \u2014\u00A0comes up against something very, very difficult, in \u201CThe Fall\u201D it\u2019s jumping into an icy river to save someone, even though you have virtually no chance of success and you would be risking your own life. And the person in \u201CThe Fall\u201D takes the path of least resistance and pretends that he doesn\u2019t hear the woman drowning. Now that\u2019s very powerful, and yet it is so basic to human nature that no one wants to take these risks themselves, and at the end of \u201CThe Fall\u201D the man \u2014\u00A0in a way he hopes that he\u2019ll come across a second incident like this so that he can redeem himself from the first time when he shied away. But at the end, he realizes that he will always be too late. In other words, he\u2019ll come up with a second excuse if it ever happens again. It just shows you how weak we are in terms of human nature and trying to \u2014\u00A0and \u2014\u00A0and there are other things. I\u2019ve read Solomon Asch study about the line study and the Milgram\u2026 About what? Solomon Asch? He did this study in 1951 where he has the groups \u2014\u00A0there\u2019s two lines, and one is a shorter line \u2014\u00A0demonstrably, visibly shorter. He has people then tell him which is the longer line. But before he does that, he has three people march in in front and pick the shorter line. Now the fourth person, who is the test subject \u2014\u00A069 percent of the time goes along with the group. Even though he can see \u2014\u00A0he doesn\u2019t trust his own senses. And this conformity \u2014\u00A0as humans, we want to conform and we are sometimes unwilling to take these tough stances and don\u2019t conform. Well, all of these things that I\u2019ve read since 9/11 have kind of fueled my passion in this area because I think in terms of integrity we are suffering almost a crisis in the country. A portion of Coleen Rowley\u2019s 2002 letter to Robert Mueller, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. `I feel at this point I have to put my concerns in writing concerning the important topic of the FBI\u2019s response to evidence of terrorist activity in the United States prior to September 11th. The issues are fundamentally ones of integrity and go to the heart of the FBI\u2019s law enforcement mission and mandate. Moreover, at this critical juncture in fashioning future policy to promote the most effective handling of ongoing and future threats to the United States\u2019 citizens\u2019 security, it is of absolute importance that an unbiased, completely accurate picture emerge of the FBI\u2019s current investigative and management strengths and failures. To get to the point, I have deep concerns that a delicate and subtle shading, skewing of facts by you and others at the highest levels of FBI management has occurred and is occurring.\u2019 Again, Coleen Rowley. You look out and you see some real evil horrible \u2014\u00A0of course we\u2019re human so we can\u2019t help it, but we\u2019re seeing this in our country and in the world. We have corporate scandals, we\u2019ve had government \u2014\u00A0we\u2019ve had the priesthood. I think you have three options. One is it\u2019s just so depressing to see so much evil, so much hatred and greed and selfishness going on. Being in the FBI unfortunately I\u2019ve seen that for 22 years because we are working criminal cases. We see the bad side of things. We see crimes every day. You know, we see greed, selfishness at work. And I think people in that case have three options. They can commit suicide \u2019cause it\u2019s so bad; it\u2019s hard to face. And you saw that analyst in England recently\u2026 Right, who was in the British government. \u2026who just committed suicide in the face of how bad he saw things. So that\u2019s one option. The other option is just to give into it. If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em. And I\u2019ve seen this happen with any number of people, and I think this is where \u2014\u00A0with students, for instance, that cheating in school? Their main excuse is how can I not cheat? Everyone else is. Corporate people will tell you the same thing. `My business competitor is doing this. We have to or our company will go down the tubes.\u2019 And then, of course, if we can\u2019t beat it, join it \u2014\u00A0we\u2019re all after the mansion and the good life and having this \u2014\u00A0you know, maybe it\u2019s a short life, but we\u2019re going to live it up while we\u2019re on this earth. So that\u2019s the second option. Then there\u2019s the third option, and that is struggling against it. And I think this is where \u2014\u00A0if I would say the word `faith,\u2019 religion comes in. There was a very famous \u2014\u00A0or I guess kind of famous Lutheran theologian who died in the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. And he said \u2014\u00A0and this is exactly what I will take from I guess my \u2014\u00A0I would definitely agree with. Is it Bonhoeffer? Dietrich\u2026 Yeah. \u2026Bonhoeffer? OK. Yeah. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, `Faith does not exist apart from human conflict, but is born of complete engagement in this world.\u2019 And that\u2019s \u2014\u00A0I guess if I have to say that\u2019s my religion, that\u2019s my religion. I go to work every day trying to make a difference and trying to think of these concepts and apply them in normal everyday life. To me that\u2019s true religion. And is that also how you think about the meaning of integrity? Say, if one of these high school students you talk to asks you what does that word mean. Well, the simplest definition of integrity is doing right when there is no one to make you do it but yourself. Another simple way of looking at it is self-policing. I talked yesterday to a group of 500 \u2014\u00A0it was the Women in Federal Law Enforcement Conference. All \u2014\u00A0almost all law enforcement officers \u2014\u00A0Customs, Air Force, Coast Guard \u2014\u00A0but they were all law enforcement officers, and I talked about self-policing. I said, `You think it\u2019s going to put us out of a job?\u2019 You know, we\u2019re \u2014\u00A0this country is so bad we\u2019re operating in a line now where we\u2019re depending on the police. Instead of operating above that, like I just mentioned, which is we would all do the right thing even when no one is watching, now we\u2019re depending on police to catch us. And when we do catch people, instead of admitting that they did something or not, it\u2019s `prove it.\u2019 We\u2019ve turned into a Court TV society. From a footnote in Coleen Rowley\u2019s May 21st, 2002, memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller. `By the way, let me furnish you the Webster\u2019s definition of careerism: the policy or practice of advancing one\u2019s career, often at the cost of one\u2019s integrity. Maybe that sums up the whole problem.\u2019 I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. I\u2019m in conversation with FBI whistle-blower Coleen Rowley. In her two decades with the FBI, she has served as a field agent, ethicist and lawyer. She is also a triathlete and an expert marksman. Her courage in telling the truth about the agency she loves and risking her job for doing it was born of principles she\u2019s always lived and worked by. So I asked her does ethics need religion. I think so. Yeah. I think that\u2019s what I was saying here. Of course, we have any number of people who are very ethical and I think in a way that is a form of religion. In the broadest sense it is. You\u2019ve got to be able to say that this does matter, even though, you know, we may \u2014\u00A0may not even see the results. We have people who will try their darnedest and don\u2019t even see they\u2019ve accomplished anything. But ultimately, you have to kind of have a belief that there is a greater good, there is a higher purpose, and you\u2019re doing it for those reasons. This ties in real well with this poem that \u2014\u00A0that\u2019s really been, like, one of the most meaningful things \u2014\u00A0motivating things as well that was sent to me in \u2014\u00A0like I would say, my darkest hour after I got the \u2014\u00A0this letter published in The New York Times in March on the eve of the Iraq war. I, of course, was tremendously criticized and called a traitor and a friend of Osama bin Laden \u2014\u00A0unbelievable stuff. Well, this poem was sent to me. Well, would you read it? Sure. Thank you. OK. It\u2019s \u2014\u00A0it was actually found at Mother Teresa\u2019s bedside and apparently was posted on her orphanages\u2019 walls, and it goes, `People are unreasonable, illogical and self-centered. Love them anyway. If you do good, people may accuse you of selfish motives. Do good anyway. If you are successful you may win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway. The good you do may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Honesty and openness make you vulnerable. Be honest and open anyway. What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway. People who really want help may attack you if you help them. Help them anyway. Give the world the best you have and you may get hurt. Give the world your best anyway.\u2019 That\u2019s the end of the poem that was sent me. But I\u2019ve actually heard there\u2019s another line to it. Following `Give the world your best anyway,\u2019 \u2014\u00A0and this is on a CD \u2014\u00A0the line says, `In the final analysis, it is between you and God. It is not between you and them.\u2019 And \u2014\u00A0and of course, this is \u2014\u00A0this explains it all. And adaptation of the prayer Coleen Rowley just read, by Suzzy and Maggie Roche on their 2001 CD \u201CZero Church.\u201D As they researched the prayer they found that although it is widely attributed to Mother Teresa and may have hung by her bedside, it was actually written by a man named Kent Keith who lives in Hawaii. He composed it as a set of ethical guidelines for student council leaders. He called it the 10 Paradoxical Commandments. It\u2019s now circulating around the world in several versions. This is Speaking of Faith. Today, \u201CWork and Conscience.\u201D After a short break, more of my extended conversation with FBI special agent Coleen Rowley. Also, journalist Tim McGuire on the morality of whistle-blowing and the burgeoning field of spirituality in the workplace. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation on belief, meaning, issues and ideas. Each week we focus on a different theme asking how religion shapes everyday life. Today, \u201CWork and Conscience.\u201D I\u2019m in conversation with FBI special agent Coleen Rowley. She gained national fame as a whistle-blower after a letter she wrote to the head of the FBI. Her action led to a full-scale investigation of the agency\u2019s handling of pre-9/11 leads. She shared the honor of Time magazine person of the year with two corporate whistle-blowers, Sherron Watkins of Enron and Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom. Coleen Rowley agreed to speak with me for this program about her personal experience, not in her professional capacity or on behalf of the FBI. She says that all that\u2019s happened to her since 9/11 forces her to tell the truth at every turn, and so on the eve of the war in Iraq, she wrote a second letter to the FBI director which was published in The New York Times. She warned that military action in Iraq would only increase the terrorism the FBI was charged to counter. `To FBI Director Robert Mueller, February 26th, 2003. Dear Director Mueller, in June 2002 on the eve of my testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, you told me that you appreciate constructive criticism and that FBI agents should feel free to voice serious concerns they may have about senior-level FBI actions. Since then, I have availed myself twice of your stated openness. At this critical point in our country\u2019s history, I have decided to try once again on an issue of even more consequence for the internal security posture of our country. That posture has been weakened by the diversion of attention from al-Qaeda to our government\u2019s plan to invade Iraq, a step that will in all likelihood bring an exponential increase in the terrorist threat to the United States, both at home and abroad. `In your recent testimony to the Senate, you noted that the al-Qaeda network will remain for the foreseeable future the most immediate and serious threat facing this country, adding that the prevention of another terrorist attack remains the FBI\u2019s top priority. You then noted that a US-Iraq war could prompt Baghdad to more directly engage al-Qaeda, and perhaps provide it with weapons of mass destruction, but you did not connect these very important dots.\u2019 Here again is Coleen Rowley. People do have perhaps an illusion or delusion that someone is a hero for having their picture on a cover of a magazine, and I disagree. I think everyone has that potential in themselves to do the right thing and then be a hero. That\u2019s why when I talk about this and tell people \u2014\u00A0we\u2019re all going to be as teachers, as corporate CEOs, as lawyers \u2014\u00A0you are going to be facing these decisions, the same type of thing, maybe to a lesser extent, maybe to a greater extent than I did. And \u2014\u00A0and it helps to talk about it. It helps to listen to others. It helps to get some mutual encouragement about doing the right thing. And so to the extent that I \u2014\u00A0I feel a kind of a calling here, and it is partly because of \u2014\u00A0of what\u2019s happened to me and perhaps partly because of the media, I\u2019ve never felt, of course, and I totally hate \u2014\u00A0I hate the term `whistle-blower.\u2019 I probably hate the term `hero\u2019 as much, and I \u2014\u00A0and it\u2019s not deserved. I actually went back to Time magazine afterwards and told them I just feel terrible about this. And I\u2019m talking about the Camus book. I said, `You know, I\u2019m going to be 95 running around one of these frozen lakes in Minnesota and see someone out on the ice, and I\u2019m going to feel like I have to go out there and try to save them now because of this \u201Chero\u201D aspect.\u2019 And I think, though, in our lives we see these things every day. The other thing here is if you really have a whistle-blower-type situation where you have to reveal some huge mistake or thing that\u2019s going to get you in trouble, it\u2019s scary to tell people to do that because in almost all cases they are going to end up being retaliated against. I can tell you it\u2019s \u2014\u00A0it\u2019s not a good thing. They may end up being fired, and in some respects, if you read \u2014\u00A0if you read history, there are people who end up being martyred over doing the right thing. You have to be honest with people when you\u2019re telling them you\u2019re in this situation; you \u2014\u00A0you \u2014\u00A0you see su \u2014\u00A0such and such going on wrong. And then say, `Oh, always do the right thing,\u2019 you know? Right, and \u2014\u00A0and you were \u2014\u00A0are the breadwinner for \u2014\u00A0for your family and you have four children, and so you took a tremendous risk. Well, losing a job \u2014\u00A0of course, a risk of losing a job is very big. Sherron Watkins will tell you, though, that walk away from those jobs where it\u2019s a bad environment and try to get a new\u2026 And Sherron Watkins \u2014\u00A0was she at Enron or\u2026 She was a \u2014\u00A0a vice president \u2014\u00A0one of the vice presidents at Enron and she had actually worked for Arthur Andersen before Enron. And you know, a job is important, but you know, it\u2019s not as important as the things I just went through in the Mother Teresa poem. Yes, and as you said, they won\u2019t pay the rent. They won\u2019t pay the mortgage \u2014\u00A0those things \u2014\u00A0is what\u2019s scary about them, right? And I again \u2014\u00A0when talking to other people it\u2019s like it\u2019s kind of scary to tell people that. But I honestly think you have to. I think we\u2019re just going way too \u2014\u00A0again, down to this lowest common denominator in this country and at some point it has to be raised up. When people see, for instance, in the corporate environment the accounting that isn\u2019t adding up but they are trying to keep up with their competitors, you\u2019ve got to stop it. Well, the poor accountant who \u2014\u00A0who brings that to light may lose their job; you\u2019re absolutely right. Are you still doing the same work that you were doing before? I was the legal counsel and then after the \u2014\u00A0The New York Times piece, I myself requested to take a grade cut to become a regular agent again, partly because in our office, there was \u2014\u00A0there were at least a core group of people who said they no longer could trust me. I don\u2019t know if over time that will, you know, stell \u2014\u00A0still stay the same. I\u2019m trying to prove that that was not correct, of course, that I\u2019m not a traitor and that I can still, you know, work fine and be friends with people, etc., and I do have strong views on a number of topics in the legal aspect, of course, the whole idea of the criminal procedure and First Amendment rights and your Miranda rights and your \u2014\u00A0our ability to conduct a search and seizure \u2014\u00A0this is all kind of in my \u2014\u00A0my \u2014\u00A0my legal background. And I have pretty strong views on that, and I\u2019m trying, of course, to \u2014\u00A0even though I\u2019m not in the legal position, I\u2019ve tried to give a couple of talks about that because that\u2019s kind of embedded now with the war on terrorism. Have you been able in your place of work with your colleagues to talk about some of the things that you and I have talked about today? What happened and what it meant and what these values are and\u2026 You know, if \u2014\u00A0if anyone would ask me I probably would, and I don\u2019t \u2014\u00A0there may have been a couple of conversations in a minor way where people have kind of asked me. But for the most part, it goes unsaid. We\u2019re far too busy in the first place for doing a whole lot of personal talking. You know, we\u2019re \u2014\u00A0we have a job. People come in and, you know, work-related topics, of course. We talk a lot and I have talked with my co-workers on any number of work-related things. But when it comes to personal stuff, not so much and especially now when we \u2014\u00A0we really just don\u2019t have the time. Coleen Rowley, what gives you energy now as you move forward, and what gives you hope? Where do you find hope? Well, I will have to say that I\u2019m a person who sees the cup half-empty for starters. It\u2019s almost a trait of whistle-blowers. I\u2019ve heard the guy from Government Accountability Project mention that he sees traits in whistle-blowers. One is that they\u2019re not able to put their morality to the side and say, `Oh, that\u2019s a one-hour thing on Sunday.\u2019 It\u2019s your whole life; it\u2019s your work, it\u2019s your family \u2014\u00A0it\u2019s everything. That\u2019s one trait. Second one is that they tend \u2014\u00A0whistle-blowers tend to almost be a little too perfectionist and too critical. And my husband is the first person will say I\u2019m an overly critical person. I have tended \u2014\u00A0you know, since 9/11 and through everything that\u2019s happened to see the hopeless side. I mean, that is the thing I think that I\u2019m battling is becoming very depressed at everyth \u2014\u00A0everything bad going on in the world. The wars, the violence, the \u2014\u00A0the hatred of \u2014\u00A0of people that are just spurring these terrorist attacks. It\u2019s \u2014\u00A0it\u2019s a very depressing thing, and \u2014\u00A0and battling that complete hopeless feeling where you just say `I give up. I can\u2019t do anything.\u2019 The only thing that is keeping me going is a development of a real strong faith. Coleen Rowley of the FBI. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. Today, \u201CWork and Conscience.\u201D In the report of the congressional joint inquiry into the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, National Security Council counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clark said this: We need a thousand more Coleen Rowleys, and you are never going to get them until you provide them with some encouragement both from the director of the FBI, from the president of the United States, and most importantly, from the Congress. In fact, it appears that the phenomenon of whistle-blowing has increased, along with the better-reported phenomenon of corporate scandal. The Government Accountability Project is a non-profit organization that helps workers in corporations and government. It reports an exponential increase in whistle-blowing in the past four years. My next guest, syndicated columnist Tim McGuire, connects the rise of conscience at work with a larger movement sometimes called spirituality in the workplace. He was a newspaper editor by the time he was in his early 30s. Later, he was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He retired two years ago and now he writes a weekly syndicated column called more than work addressing ethics, spirituality and values. He traces his interest in this field to a period in which he was searching for ways to reconcile his own conscience with his style of leadership. I had a conversation with a workplace consultant in \u201993 that I remember vividly, in which we were going back and forth and I was complaining about the behavior of staff and the like. And he and I went back and forth, and he said some things and finally \u2014\u00A0I don\u2019t remember a lot of what he said specifically, but I remember me saying, `I can\u2019t just pretend to be a person of faith on Sunday and then not act it out here at work every day, can I?\u2019 And he gave me this big smile, like `I knew you\u2019d get it eventually.\u2019 And \u2019round 1997 or so I started some academic study in the area, and there is not a lot of academic study. There are no programs in the United States on workplace spirituality and ethics and values. There are some courses. Right. And I\u2019ve taken some of those courses, but most of it is self-taught, and what I\u2019ve attempted to do with this column is to articulate, I guess, the discipline of workplace spirituality and ethics and values, and start the discussion about them. These days, that discussion is well under way. There\u2019s a growing movement reflected in book sales, seminars and coaching. McGuire believes that it is going to reach a tipping point in the next five years. He has a concrete sense of how that is already playing itself out in some American companies. He says that spirituality at work is at heart about employees bringing their whole selves to work. But I wondered whether that might not get in the way of work itself. I asked Tim McGuire how he changed in concrete ways when he began to integrate his spiritual sensibility into his job. One of the things that I started with was not blaming everybody else for my troubles, and starting to put personal responsibility for myself not only for my own happiness, my own comfort, but for the comfort of others, and started realizing that if people were frustrated, I owned a part of that and started to work in that way. I started to look at, you know, how the golden rule plays out in the workplace \u2014\u00A0pretty basic concept. But it would make the workplace better if we all thought more about it. And it is tricky, isn\u2019t it? I mean, we pretend like workplaces are places where we are all being professional, and in fact, everybody\u2019s humanity comes into the workplace in the same way that it\u2019s present in the family, although\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026in some ways not as directly, which may make \u2014\u00A0make it even more difficult. Yeah, I think it very much is there, and we do bring all of our selves to work \u2014\u00A0or we should \u2014\u00A0and that, you will find that those places that have the highest morale and the people who feel most \u2014\u00A0most fulfilled are where they are allowed to bring their complete selves to work. It\u2019s when you have to start parceling your life \u2014\u00A0your faith life belongs on Sunday, your work life belongs on Monday, your family life belongs at home, your work life is at work \u2014\u00A0that\u2019s when you start getting into emotional difficulties; that\u2019s when you start getting into anger and frustration that\u2019ll play out in a lot of ugly ways. But how do you work with the fact that if you say we\u2019re all complete human beings, we bring our whole selves to work, all of our emotions \u2014\u00A0all \u2014\u00A0all the things that may be happening in the rest of our lives \u2014\u00A0how do you then combine compassion and morality in drawing the lines where that then gets in the way of the work? I think that some of the companies who have been successful at this have been better performers than other companies. OK. So holding those two things as twin values\u2026 And they hold them in tension with each other. OK. A lot of companies who are successful in this area hold things in tension that they \u2014\u00A0they have all these as goals, and if one gets slighted, then they\u2019re not succeeding. So I want to know from you whether that faith component makes a difference, how it makes a difference. I think it can, but it can also destroy a company because we are a country of multiple faiths and we always have to recognize that and we have to celebrate multiple faiths. And that\u2019s why I put my emphasis on spirituality and not on faith. And in spirituality, your playing to that power that you believe has created you, that is the energy behind our lives. You can call it God, you can call it Fred if you want, but most people believe in that. And if we believe that we are driven by something beyond a paycheck, beyond rising in a career and it is something like common good and meaning and core morality, then I think we \u2014\u00A0we really do make our work a spiritual exercise. Some people would call those three elements \u2014\u00A0your work is a calling then. Right. Work is how we spend much of, if not most of our life. It ought to be the same kind of life-giving force in our life that our family, that our hobbies and that our joys are. It should be one of our joys. And for too many people, it is not one of our joys. You know, I think what I\u2019m hearing you say also is that that joy or that calling is not necessarily defined by what the work is but how people are present in their workplace as human beings. MR. MCGUIRE: That\u2019s my argument. So you know, when you use this catchphrase `spirituality in the workplace,\u2019 I think people might imagine there are prayer groups going on, and that\u2019s not at all\u2026 Not at all. \u2026what you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m talking about. In fact, I try to get away from that. I think that that kind of thing can be a divisive force. Now is that sad? Yeah, a little. But I think what it\u2019s all about is about our work enriching us and us enriching our work. And we\u2019re doing that because we know we\u2019re a part of something bigger, some larger force. And I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Both in boomers and in the next generations, the search for meaning is very big. They look at their work in the same way I just talked about and say, `Is this all there is? Is this what work really is about?\u2019 I went to a reunion of my high school class and the class before it over the weekend, the frustration with work was pretty discouraging. We have to fix that. As I\u2019ve said in a recent column, the system is in real trouble. The gap between executives and employees is getting wider and wider, and you don\u2019t have to be concerned about spirituality in the workplace to be concerned about that issue. Right. You just have to be concerned about the capitalistic system, and if you are we have to close that gap, and I think having more of a focus on ethics, values and spirituality is one way to close that gap. But we do tend to focus on CEOs when we talk about workplace ethics, and you\u2019re really calling more people to be like whistle-blowers. Very much, and I\u2019m very much talking about behavior of everyone in a corporation, and sometimes readers don\u2019t like that because readers really want to blame everything on CEOs. OK. And that\u2019s nuts. I\u2019ve done several columns related to this subject. What I get a lot of, and I just got some more this week, are people who say, `Please don\u2019t tell people to be whistle-blowers. The price is too high.\u2019 And that rips me up. There really is a great deal of intimidation in the workplace, and one of the huge dangers, I think, right now is that a lot of people at the top are denying that. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem. And I\u2019m convinced there is. I try to always talk about everybody\u2019s responsibility in the workplace. I think that it is true we have a leadership problem in America; we also have a followership problem in America. And that\u2019s not a popular thing to say. Even leaders bristle at that \u2014\u00A0`Boy, whoa, you don\u2019t want to say that.\u2019 It\u2019s true. We have a leadership problem and a followership problem. And just to pull it back to this \u2014\u00A0I hear an echo in what you\u2019re saying with my conversation with Coleen Rowley, with the interview I once did with Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic, that\u2026 A true leader in this area. \u2026yeah, a true leader in this area, and the notion that in fact telling the truth and facing one\u2019s own weaknesses is \u2014\u00A0is something that a spiritual discipline calls one to. Reconciliation, forgiveness \u2014\u00A0all of those concepts. But vulnerability is not something that especially little American boys are urged to do. And obviously my life situation, a lifelong handicap and being the father of a Down syndrome boy, has led me to find vulnerability I think a little easier than some. But vulnerability is absolutely essential to this. And I\u2019ve been thinking about an earlier question you asked. Certainly, staring at my own shortcomings as a leader has helped me pursue this area and think about it more. I\u2019m going to ask you to read this column that you wrote, which talked about whistle-blowing as a sort of phenomenon. There are these famous whistle-blowers who are the Time persons of the year, and Coleen Rowley is somebody I\u2019ve had a conversation with that\u2019s part of this hour, and again, you know, you bring some religious language into that, so I\u2019m just going to ask you to read that. OK. `E-mail writers are constantly telling me that even though their workplaces are bleak and their bosses refuse to listen to sincere, well-intentioned feedback and advice, they are too frightened to rock the sinking corporate boat. They say nothing and do nothing. Fortunately, Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom, Coleen Rowley of the FBI and Sherron Watkins of Enron were not afraid to rock the boat, and that\u2019s why Time magazine made them the persons of the year. I\u2019m afraid most American workers are still too frightened, too reluctant and too intimidated to even speak their minds, much less be whistle-blowers. Because of the sheer negative power of bosses, too few people in the workplace are comfortable with the concept that some call prophetic work. The concept simply means speaking out for the what the worker believes is right. The ancient religious prophets spoke out against the kings, the rich, the powerful and they spoke to protect the poor, the lame and the sick. They spoke for truth. One scholar, Matthew Fox, says every profession requires prophets. He says the prophet by definition interferes and one significant place for our interference is where we work and earn a living. `As with all work and spirituality issues, the responsibility for the reluctance of American workers to be prophets, to speak their mind about wrongdoing, bad customer service or the abuse of privileges by other employees rests with both bosses and workers. `Here are six things I believe would make all of us better work prophets: One, start with yourself; make sure you are serving the interests of the company and not your own self-interests. Two, make sure the issues you advocate relate to the core values of the company; stop and ask yourself if it\u2019s really worth the fight; don\u2019t battle over the color of the drapes. Three, build, don\u2019t destroy; be constructive. Four, enhance the self-esteem of others; remove contention by carefully listening to what other people say; then make their comments part of your solution. Five, be clear and straightforward without being judgmental; be direct, but don\u2019t load up your argument with a snotty tone or condescension. Six, make your suggestions specific, actionable and manageable; too often we try to fix all the problems of the world in one meeting. These six steps will help you be more courageous and effective in the workplace.\u2019 Tim McGuire is a consultant and syndicated columnist. He\u2019s currently James Batten Visiting Professor of Journalism and Public Policy at Davidson College. Earlier in this hour, you heard FBI agent and Time magazine Person of the Year Coleen Rowley.
