  "fullText": "\u201CI\u2019m interested in revelation, in what will be revealed through the poem, through me \u2014 not what I have to reveal, but what it has to reveal.\u201D Today, a conversation with verse, with the Irish poet and New Yorker poetry editor Paul Muldoon. He\u2019s won the Pulitzer Prize, written for other media from radio to song, and plays in a rock band, Rogue Oliphant. He visited us for a magical day at the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis, including a dinner salon and reading from his work \u2014 like this excerpt from his poem called \u201CPelt.\u201D They piled it on all day till I gave way to a contentment I\u2019d not felt in years, not since that winter I\u2019d worn the world against my skin, worn it fur side in. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Paul Muldoon holds the Howard G.B. Clark chair in the Humanities at Princeton University. He\u2019s been with the The New Yorker since 2007. And he is the author of 12 major collections of poetry, including Horse Latitudes, Hay and his latest collection, One Thousand Things Worth Knowing. So, you were born in County Armagh, in Northern Ireland, in a Catholic family, in the Moy. The Moy was the name of the village? The Moy is the name of the village. It\u2019s the village nearby. It\u2019s actually on the border of counties Armagh and Tyrone. So it\u2019s about halfway across Northern Ireland. Oh, I see, OK. Yeah. And we were actually in County Armagh, but the Moy itself is in County Tyrone substantially. OK. And then there\u2019s a little village across from it, a hamlet really, called Charlemont. So a small place. And to be born in that part of the world also was to be born in a place that loved poetry, and kind of lived and breathed story. And I wonder if you think in terms of the spiritual background of your life, expansively defined, would you think about poetry and story as a piece of that, as well? Well, I would say so, yes. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have been conscious of that as a child. Right, right. But of course, we were brought up in a culture where, for example, of an evening, a knock might come to the door, and a neighbor would be there, and he would be hoping to come in, and he was welcomed in, and he\u2019d have a cup of tea, at least. And then he \u2014 predominately he, but a few women came around, too \u2014 would perhaps sing a song, or recite a ballad or a poem. So that was \u2014 certainly we were conscious of the larger literary tradition, I mean the tradition in its widest sense, including the oral tradition. So that certainly was part of the back of our mind, too, or perhaps even the front of our mind. But way up front, I think, was the religious aspect. If one had said \u201Cspirituality,\u201D that\u2019s what we would\u2019ve been talking about. It was organized religion. Right. And Catholicism in particular. You noted in another interview that the Celts had a god of eloquence, which I loved, Ogmios. I\u2019m very interested in this question of what poetry gives voice to in us, what it works in human beings. And I\u2019ve discussed this with poets along the way, and I \u2014 and musicians. How would you start to talk about what poetry as a form of expression, and also its forms of language, distinctively draws out? Well, it is a form of expression, of course. It is an expression of something within as well something without, and perhaps, indeed, the point at which the two combine. It\u2019s very difficult to find a decent metaphor for this. One of the defining characteristics of a metaphor, of course, is that it breaks down fairly soon. You know, only up to a point \u2026 You mean any metaphor? That\u2019s right, any metaphor. Only up to a point is my love like a red, red rose. Right. Only up to a point. So to find a decent way of thinking about it, you know, the expression I \u2014 let\u2019s think of what I would say to my students. I mean, the expression of \u2014 it\u2019s not as if one is setting out to express oneself. And I say that because, ideally, one has no sense of what is going to come out. As a poet, you mean? As a poet. It\u2019s not as if one has a point of view, I think, ideally. Which is not to say, of course, that there are poems that don\u2019t present points of view, not to say that one has an idea, which is of course not to say that poems don\u2019t express ideas. But that\u2019s not where we begin. We begin again from ignorance, from, perhaps, the germ of something, from a hunch, from a notion that if we take a couple of elements in the world and set them down, something might \u2014 something interesting might happen. And gradually, as the poem, in this case, comes into being, what it\u2019s trying to do in the world gradually becomes clear. And it\u2019s only, in fact, as one comes out the other end of it, I think, ideally, that one realizes what it is. Now, of course, there are other theories of art. I mean, Bertolt Brecht, for example, would say, \u201CWell, actually we have to begin with the idea we\u2019re going to make a political point.\u201D And I absolutely understand that. It\u2019s not the kind of art-making I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019m interested in revelation, in what will be revealed through the poem, through me \u2014 not what I have to reveal, but what it has to reveal, if that makes any sense. So I have no revelations at all. I know nothing. I\u2019m not to be trusted on anything. But the poem may know something, and may be trusted, actually, on what it has to express in the world, in my practice. Others may think about it differently. And as much as you are, it sounds like, perhaps surprised by \u2014 there\u2019s a process of discovery for you of what the poem is? Totally. Right? There\u2019s got to be a process of discovery. And then, are you sometimes surprised by that work the poem does in the world, which you also could not have intended? Or how it lands in other people? Well, yes. I mean, part of the job, of course, is to try to figure out what its impact will be. As you\u2019re writing? As one\u2019s writing. All right. Because if you think about it \u2014 again, it\u2019s hard to find a decent analogy for this \u2014 but let\u2019s just take it that there are two people involved in the writing of the poem. There\u2019s the writer, who is appealing to her unconscious, to her profound sense of unknowing. And then there\u2019s the reader, who, as the poem comes into being, as I say, as one word puts itself after another, is trying to figure out what the impact of those words in that order might be from a position of knowing. Right? And it\u2019s the negotiation between these two, the unknowing and the knowing, that, crudely put, would represent the positions of the writer and the reader. So if the first reader of the poem is the writer herself, in a strange way the poem is, indeed, only finished, only completely \u2014 becomes completely what it might be when that other person comes to it. You know, one thing you said \u2014 I mean, you, as I say, you\u2019ve done many different kinds of writing in your life. I have tried. Right? And you\u2019ve written for radio, for example, and you\u2019ve written for television, and you\u2019ve written for music. One thing you\u2019ve said about poetry that is distinct from other kinds of writing that intrigues me is that poetry doesn\u2019t build to the big idea like many other kinds of writing, but it starts there, that the poem starts where many kinds of writing would be winding up. I did say something like that. Of course, one has \u2014 I have to think of all the things one has said, including all the daft things one has said, I\u2019m sure. That \u2014 I think I recognize what you\u2019re alluding to. I think that may have been \u2014 there\u2019s a lovely interview in The Paris Review. I think it may have been that interview. And I can just \u2014 yeah, I can just ask you, like, how would you talk about how writing a poem is distinct from all those other kinds of writing? Well, actually, I think it\u2019s often most useful not to think of it as being all that distinct. I think one of the problems with the general perception of poetry is that we think it\u2019s special. And if anything, I think we\u2019d be better served if we thought it was much more like prose fiction. Much more like theater criticism or film criticism than occupying this kind of special realm, Poetryland, you know? Yeah. Poetryville, where all bets are off, anything can happen. And again, I used to say to my students, and still do, if they listen to me \u2014 which is unlikely, of course \u2014 that I expect the poem to be at least as interesting as the film review in the next column. I expect it to \u2014 or at least, in general, there\u2019s no particular reason why it wouldn\u2019t have a beginning, middle, and an end, generally in that order, though of course there are times when that\u2019s not what it needs. And that it make sense, unless for some reason it doesn\u2019t quite. Right. You know? And that as much thought has gone into it as has gone into a film review or the leader in the local newspaper. Right. The op-ed piece. And that it actually \u2014 and one comes out the other end of it thinking, \u201CHuh, that was interesting, I\u2019m glad I was in there. I actually learned something in there.\u201D Not necessarily about whether or not the economy is healthy, but perhaps something about the \u2014 just a new way of looking at something that one hasn\u2019t quite seen before. A way of looking at a wheelbarrow, a way of looking at a plum in an icebox, some modest little shift in the world, but a shift, a revelation. And, basically, if there isn\u2019t some kind of revelation, it hasn\u2019t been worth one\u2019s while to be in there. At least they weren\u2019t speaking French when my father sat with his brothers and sisters, two of each, on a ramshackle bench at the end of a lane marked by two white stones and made mouth music as they waited, chilled to the bone Fol-de-rol, fol-de-rol, fol-de-rol-di-oh for the bus meant to bring their parents back from town. It came and went. Nothing. One sister was weighed down By the youngest child. A grocery bag from a town more distant still, in troth. What started as a cough Fol-de-rol, fol-de-rol, fol-de-rol-di-oh would briefly push him forward to some minor renown then shove him back, oddly summery, down along the trench to that far-flung realm where, at least, they weren\u2019t speaking French. That\u2019s Paul Muldoon reading an excerpt from his poem \u201CAt Least They Weren\u2019t Speaking French\u201D at the On Being studios on Loring Park. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I think also what you\u2019re alluding to, in a general way, also, is we\u2019re not sure what the place of poetry is in a culture like this. I mean, it\u2019s not the culture you grew up in, where it was lived and breathed and not, as you say, not the domain of Poetryworld, but of ordinary people in ordinary life. You tell a story somewhere about being with your son \u2014 your children, that children are natural poets, that somehow that this is with us. You told a story about your son driving along on the highway and saying, \u201CThose lights are like tadpoles.\u201D And we\u2019ve all had that experience. I think I\u2019ve given one interview too many, I really do. Well, I may stop \u2026 I vaguely remember that. Well, this is one way \u2014 but all right, I\u2019ll stop quoting you at yourself. No, no, no, not at all. I think it is \u2026 But this idea that, somehow \u2014 how does it get lost? What\u2019s your analysis of that? I\u2019m afraid that, too often, it gets educated out of us. Yeah. I mean, that is something we\u2019ve heard once or twice, maybe more than once or twice. But I really believe this, that the natural capacity that an eight-year-old or a nine-year-old has for coming up with, unselfconsciously, coming up with novel ways of seeing the world, I mean, ways that actually inform us about how the world is. They\u2019re fanciful in some sense, but they\u2019re actually instructive, I think. And one of the reasons why the child \u2014 we\u2019ve heard this from William Wordsworth \u2014 \u201CThe child is father to the man.\u201D And I think, in some sense, she is. Because she is capable of that unprogrammed, unthinking way of seeing the world. No preconceptions, no misconceptions. And there comes a point, actually, where I think we begin to educate that out of them. At some point, we\u2019ll say, \u201COh, that\u2019s lovely, that\u2019s very nice.\u201D But at some point, we probably said, \u201CWell, you know, actually, you know, your tadpole analogy doesn\u2019t really hold up. Get serious, get real, grow up.\u201D And that capacity to be innocent and open, for want of better terms, ignorant again \u2026 To see unexpected likenesses, metaphors. That\u2019s right. And we continue to do that. But we tend \u2014 whether or not we write poetry, we continue to see these unexpected connections. And that, of course \u2014 it\u2019s odd that it doesn\u2019t have more of a place in the world, because that idea of the connection is quite central, of course, to who we are and how we operate. We love to make connections. Yeah. And it\u2019s what makes us feel good in the world. It\u2019s what sends our endorphins buzzing around or whatever they do. Yeah, yeah. So, somehow, in the poetry business, let\u2019s say, other things begin to push in. One of them is that poetry of a certain kind is introduced into the head. What passes for poetry tends to end up as merely Dr. Seuss. Now, I love Dr. Seuss. I think he\u2019s fabulous. I think he\u2019s fabulous. But if you ask an eight-year-old to write a poem, she\u2019ll come up with the tadpoles. You ask a 15-year-old to write a poem, and it\u2019s sort of sub-sub-sub-Seuss. Interesting. And something has happened. And I think a large part of this falls on the shoulders of educators in the broadest sense \u2014 the parents, the teachers. \u201CThis is poetry.\u201D And of course it\u2019s one form of poetry. But my own view is that children should be\u00A0\u2014 insofar as we have any control over them at all, and of course, as parents, we know we have less and less, as it should be \u2014 but in some sense, I think we should be introducing them to Robert Frost, and Lord Byron, and Tennyson, and Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop, and Emily Dickinson, and John Donne. We should be giving them not, quote-unquote, children\u2019s poetry, but poetry. Right. I think it\u2019s much, much more effective to give them Mozart and Handel and whoever. I mean, is that grown-up music, children\u2019s music? It\u2019s music. Yeah. Give them music. And I do think that we are what we eat. And if you are given a completely Seussian diet \u2014 as I say, I love Seuss, but if that\u2019s all you\u2019re eating, there are going to be problems. And that compounds the problem. There are other aspects. Again, poetry is, perhaps, often overly taught. When the teacher comes around to teaching poetry, I think in many schools, not all, she herself is actually quite nervous about poetry. She has to show the child the intricacies of the poem, the great unknown territory of the poem that, without the teacher, the child would get lost and wouldn\u2019t last a day, would die of exposure in the poem\u2026 Right, right, right, right. \u2026without this fantastically prepared guide through the poem. And I think as teachers we all run the risk of wanting to show how smart we are, and it\u2019s part of what happens, then, is that the child is convinced that a poem is never about what it seems to be about. It\u2019s always about something else. It\u2019s always encoded in some way. Inexplicable. Inexplicable. It\u2019s never about what it is, what it seems to be about. And it\u2019s beyond us. It\u2019s beyond us. And the fact of the matter is it is not beyond us. It\u2019s right there. And what has tended to happen, and one of the reasons why there may be a little difficulty with the reading of poetry \u2014 in most cultures, actually, not only this \u2014 is that we have neglected to accept that to listen to music, you have to learn to listen to music. Now, we learn to listen to music by having the radio on 24 hours a day, by being bombarded by it in the mall, everywhere. So we\u2019re actually quite au fait with how music works. Right. We\u2019re absolutely au fait with how film works. When we go to see the new, whatever, blockbuster, we are very well equipped to watch it, and we know what it\u2019s alluding to, if anything. We know its structure. We recognize a flashback. We are able to come out of it and say, \u201CYou know, along with Rotten Tomatoes, I give that 80.\u201D Right, right. \u201CAlong with Siskel and Ebert, it\u2019s two thumbs up.\u201D Yeah. Or \u201Ctwo thumbs down.\u201D With poetry, we have not had that exposure. It\u2019s as simple as that. And you\u2019re the poetry editor of The New Yorker. So I\u2019m told. Which infiltrates poetry in along with other kinds of writing and thinking and reviewing. As you said, it\u2019s next to the film review. It is, and that\u2019s one of the great things about that magazine. Yes. It\u2019s very rare in America. It\u2019s a fabulous magazine in many ways, including that way, and \u2014 we have a difficulty, though. We have a difficulty. And the difficulty is that we\u2019re able to carry only 100 poems a year. What does \u201Cable\u201D mean? Because of room constraints? Yes. And, you know, there are two poems a week in the magazine usually. I\u2019d say 100 a year. And we know all too well that there are more than 100 good poems being written in this country. Many more. Many, many more. So what I think would be fabulous would be if The New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the L.A. Times, whatever, The Boston Globe, if these newspapers were able \u2014 if they could just have at least a poem, if not every day, every couple of days, once a week. It would \u2014 actually, they wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything for it. They\u2019d need to pay somebody to keep an eye on it, I suppose. But it would be \u2014 to get the sense that poetry is not special. Right. That it\u2019s there as a \u2014 just another feature and factor and fact of life. Amidst all of our other ways of communicating, writing \u2026 Amidst all of \u2014 or being. And being. It would be lovely to think that people might be discussing the poem in the paper the way they\u2019d be discussing the Mets score. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Having said that, I really don\u2019t want to be part of too many more discussions of, you know, the demise of poetry, the poor state that poetry is in. I mean, frankly, there are a lot of people writing poetry. There aren\u2019t enough reading it. But it\u2019s not necessarily an art form that is at death\u2019s door. I just don\u2019t subscribe to it. I don\u2019t think so, either. My experience, when we put poetry on the air in this radio show, is that people respond to it like they were starved for it all along, and they didn\u2019t know it. It\u2019s not even just \u2014 it\u2019s not a discovery. They understand it wasn\u2019t even optional. Well, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s really a responsibility of the media outlets, as we call them, I guess \u2014 it seems like a crass term \u2014 but it\u2019s our responsibility to give people that opportunity. You know, I want to tell you, I\u2019m one of these people who cannot abandon the printed page. I still do all my reading in books. Same here. However \u2014 and even my magazines. But I stumbled upon the fact that when you read The New Yorker on the iPad, you can listen to the poet reading the poem, which is brilliant. So it\u2019s one of the few places I\u2019m now going, to this mobile device, for the reading, because it\u2019s both of those layers of the poem, which is so wonderful. Well, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m delighted you enjoy that. And that, indeed, is the ideal way to experience a poem is a combination of being able to read it and being about to hear it. Because there\u2019s always something of interest in how, in particular, the person through whom it came into the world delivers it into the world. There\u2019s something revelatory, again, about having that experience. And we\u2019re \u2014 our first experience of poetry was, if we were lucky, was an auditory one. And while not all poems absolutely function as aural experiences\u00A0\u2014 of course they don\u2019t, there are many that operate more for the eye \u2014 most of them do. And, mostly, there\u2019s something rewarding to be had from that experience, I think. One good turn deserves a bird in the hand. A bird in the hand is better than no bread. To have your cake is to pay Paul. [laughter] Make hay while you can still hit the nail on the head. [laughter] For want of a nail the sky might fall.

[applause] Find Paul Muldoon reading this poem, \u201CSymposium,\u201D and others at onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with verse with the poet Paul Muldoon. He\u2019s the poetry editor of The New Yorker magazine, and a professor at Princeton University. He spent a day of conversation, food, and public reading at our studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. I lived for a while in divided Berlin in the 1980s, when the wall divided the city, and experienced a place where poets were heroes. People didn\u2019t have a lot of what makes life meaningful or comfortable handed to them, but they did carve out lives of dignity and beauty and integrity. And in those spheres, poets were such important people. Poetry had a \u2014 it was cherished, and it was also dangerous, and these poets sometimes got expelled. And I know that \u2014 I was last year at a gathering where there were poets from places like Sierra Leone. I mean, it\u2019s true across human history that in dark times, often, that this need in us for poetry, I think, rises to the surface, becomes more evident. Now, you are often called a poet of \u201Cthe Troubles,\u201D that you came out of Northern Ireland\u2019s trauma. I wonder how this might speak to where this country is right now, in this early 21st century with so many large, open questions. I\u2019m glad you think so. Yeah. Not everybody thinks that. Oh. A lot of people think the deal is done here, that America has arrived at the condition of being America. Yeah, well, we\u2019re human beings, so the deal is never done, right? Well, I think so. Yeah. But other people \u2014 for example, on the poetry front, I think a lot of people continue to think, well, poetry actually happens in one of these more interesting places. Right. Well, so my question to you is \u2014 and you\u2019re working with students, you\u2019re working with young people, so here. How do you think about the role of poetry in hard times and in moments of upheaval, because this is a moment of upheaval, whether we are reckoning with it or not? Do you mean in the U.S.? Yeah, in the U.S., it\u2019s true. Well, yes, I mean, as I say, for people to recognize that it is, I think, is probably \u2014 I think a lot of people are reluctant. Despite all the evidence, despite what they see on the TV news, if they watch the TV news \u2014 and there are many reasons why they could do well not to watch the TV news, because so much of it is bunkum, and so little of it is \u2026 And demoralizing and paralyzing. So little of it is news. But one would like to think that poetry and the other arts would help us, to some extent, make sense of these things. And I\u2019m sure there is actually a certain amount of writing now that represents, for example, the black experience in this country in a way that is very refreshing, and is very welcome. Will that stop policemen shooting black men at will, it seems, in some cases? I don\u2019t know. One of the interesting things about poetry and poets is that we are often called upon to do the work, put crudely, that should be done by other agencies. You know, we don\u2019t necessarily \u2014 generally, at least \u2014 ask painters, or philosophers, or composers, or many other forms of artiste to help us solve our societal problems. Right. And it\u2019s partly because, of course, we think there\u2019s \u2014 and understandably so \u2014 that poets are, indeed, special cases, and that they have some kind of extraordinary insight into how things work, which in ways they do. But I don\u2019t know if we should be expected to come in and solve society\u2019s problems. It\u2019s part of an idea that\u2019s been presented by poets themselves, of course, as well as readers, that, somehow, poetry may be a form of salve, of salvation, that it\u2019s a form of succour, S-U-C-C-O-U-R\u2026 O-R. \u2026succour, in the world. Yes, but I wonder if that moment of desperation where literalistic, can-do, pragmatic Americans come into that moment of acknowledging one\u2019s helplessness and ignorance\u2026 I\u2019d love to see it. \u2026and turn to poetry as one of the resources. As one of the resources? As one of the resources for courage, and bringing some beauty, and perhaps some playfulness, and some reflection of the unconscious. I think that\u2019s right. It would be great if that were to happen. There\u2019s a little bit of a problem, though, which is, in the popular imagination, poetry is all salve. It\u2019s all beauty, things of beauty, beauty in the world. And unfortunately for those who hold that position, if one actually looks at poetry, one realizes that, more often than not, it\u2019s a representation of ugliness, of the difficulties of the world. The complexity \u2026 The complexity of the world. And I think it is necessarily so, because that, unfortunately, is the larger part of what we meet. And, again, I think it\u2019s too much for us to go to poetry, or any of the other art forms, expecting them to bring us merely beauty. Right, or to be merely uplifting. And to be merely uplifting. Yeah. I read somewhere recently about \u2014 I think it was Bruce Springsteen who was talking about how many of \u2014 I hope I\u2019m not misquoting him \u2014 I think was himself talking about how many of his songs are constructed, and they begin with some sense of desolation, and then some sense of uplift, or whatever. But desolation is part of the deal. I think that\u2019s a good example, too, because I don\u2019t think this \u2014 whatever the uplift is doesn\u2019t negate the desolation, right? It\u2019s still there. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. And I think, as human beings, we have to live amidst this terrific morass, mess of information, and these various upheavals in the world, the various assaults on us \u2014 physical, intellectual \u2014 that push in on our lives. And to find ways of \u2014 a phrase I use sometimes \u2014 being equal to that, being equal to that pressure. It\u2019s very difficult. But we have to do it. In Armagh or Tyrone I fell between two stones. In Armagh or Tyrone on a morning in June I fell between two stones. In Armagh or Tyrone on a morning in June in 1951 I fell between two stones. In Armagh or Tyrone on a morning in June in 1951 I fell between two stones that raised me as their own. Paul Muldoon with an excerpt from his poem \u201CThe Outlier.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Song and music are important to you. You have a rock band, is that right? Well, I do try to write lyrics, and I\u2019ve tried to write lyrics for various bands. Bands come and go. And I just, I love music. And I was \u2014 like many of a certain age, 64 now \u2014 when I heard \u201CWhen I\u2019m 64\u201D from the Beatles, it\u2019s, I suppose, like everyone else, perhaps, themselves, they were thinking, that\u2019s a long way down the road. Yeah. But the truth is that has been part of our \u2014 part of our being, actually. And, in fact, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is as much, I would imagine \u2014 I would be surprised if it weren\u2019t the case, if it\u2019s not as much an inspiration to my writing life as Theodore Roethke, or any of the other writers whose names begin with R, Robert Frost. We\u2019re almost indivisible from it. It\u2019ll be very hard to distinguish oneself from all those noises that have been in the air for so long. I think you make such an important point that poetry and song are so much \u2014 to the extent that there\u2019s a border between them, it\u2019s very porous. And, in fact, that \u2014 here I am quoting you at yourself again. That\u2019s all right. Go ahead. But someplace else, you talked somewhere about the fact that there\u2019s kind of a modern disdain of poetry that rhymes. It\u2019s not necessarily in fashion, or it goes out of fashion again and again. But that, in fact, in song, what we have is rhyming poetry, and that that continually keeps humanity in touch with that, whether the official world of poetry is doing it or not. It\u2019s so interesting. It\u2019s a way to think about how poetry is, in fact, woven into our lives in ways that we don\u2019t imagine. Of course it is. And poetry comes in all sorts of forms, all kinds of forms, all shapes, all manner of ways. And I think if we take into account all the manifestations of poetry in the world \u2014 including some in prose fiction, by the way, and nonfiction \u2014 with the ways in which it goes back to some of its earliest sources, the riddle, the prayer, the charm, the incantation, which, of course, were all forms of poetry in some societies, and continue to be, I think, in many. If one accepts, in one\u2019s expansiveness, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and rap, and country music. This is wonderful. I want to just ask a couple more questions. It\u2019s \u2026 Do you think you have stuff? I have no idea what\u2026 Absolutely, absolutely. \u2026if you have stuff you might like. I have no idea. So much. I wanted to \u2014 you can see I always have far too many notes. No, no, not at all, that\u2019s good. I reached out to a friend who is in Northern Ireland, who actually heads the Corrymeela Community. Oh, yeah. And he\u2019s a poet, in addition to being a peacemaker. And I wanted to read you \u2014 where is it \u2014 what he said to me. I told him I was interviewing you, and he said \u2014 and this, I think, goes back to what you said a moment ago about what the poet can be expected to do and shouldn\u2019t be expected to do. He said, \u201CMuldoon has never been a poet that I turn to to soothe the heart, more to trouble the waters and to electrify the possibilities of form and limits.\u201D Well, he\u2019s a wise man because\u2026 Obviously. \u2026if he wants something to soothe the heart, he needs to go somewhere else. Yeah. Perhaps to the scriptures, or any of the great texts of the great organized religions. Yeah. They\u2019re in the business, some of the time, of doing that. Though I\u2019d say that vast tracts of the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament, as some refer to it, are hardly likely to soothe the heart. Right. Well, desolation is big in those texts, as well. Absolutely, yes, absolutely. Right. I wouldn\u2019t go there for comfort, necessarily, either. No. I\u2019d go for a cup of cocoa. He was telling me that in the Irish language, the words for poem and poet have different etymologies. Yes, I mean, the word for file\u00A0\u2014 the word for \u201Cpoet\u201D is file. Right, for \u201Cpoet,\u201D right. Of course, the word \u201Cpoet,\u201D itself, from the Greek, means \u201Ca maker.\u201D So it\u2019s possible that the \u201Cf-\u201D bit of it is related to \u201Cfact,\u201D \u201Cfactoring,\u201D or something, \u201Cmaking,\u201D \u201Cfabricating\u201D as a kind of Indo-European \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m probably making that up. But the word for a poem is d\u00E1n, D-A-N. And there\u2019s another word in Irish, d\u00E1n, which means fate. And it could be that there\u2019s a connection between those two. Between the poem connected to fate, having a fatefulness \u2026 Fate, or being \u2014 you know, one of the things I\u2019m fascinated by \u2014 and as I say, I\u2019m not certain of this etymology \u2014 but I am nonetheless interested in the idea of that sense that we have when we read a poem that there\u2019s something inevitable about it, that it was fated to be like this. It was never meant to be any other way. This is the only way it can be. It can\u2019t be translated. We can\u2019t give a pr\u00E9cis of it. We can\u2019t really describe it in terms other than its own. It was always meant to be. It came to us through a poet, and it\u2019s like this. And so that sense of the fatedness, the inevitability, and perhaps even the eternity of the poem. Let me just ask you \u2026 Sure. This is a large question\u2026 Sure. \u2026and I\u2019m not asking you to answer it, but \u2026 I\u2019ll give you a little answer. OK. The question is, how would you think, how would you start to talk about \u2014 because this is an answer that would have no end \u2014 what your life as a poet, now that you\u2019re 64, as the song predicted, but you never thought it would be about you \u2014 what has your life taught you about, revealed to you, about what it means to be human? How would you start to start to think about that? Maybe what you\u2019re continuing to learn. What it means to be human? Yeah. That large, existential question. Well, of course when one\u2019s 16 and looking at the 64-year-old, one imagines that he knows something, is certain of something, that his experience really adds up to something, that his experience may be brought to bear on some \u2014 not any task, particularly whatever area of focus might be, if he has one. And in my case, the thing I know now, and I\u2019m sure this is true of many, is how \u2014 not even how little I know, but how I know nothing, in fact. You know? And I thought, I know nothing about anything. And the things that we thought indeed were verities, I think I\u2019m right in saying that, you know, ranging from Pluto being a planet\u2026 Right. \u2026through E equalling MC squared, about which there seems to be some question, never mind the notion of the universe, which is a phrase we used when we were \u2014 from time to time. In fact, I think there was a Catholic newspaper called The Universe. At that stage, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m right in saying we had no idea that it should really be called \u201Cthe universes,\u201D the millions, or is it billions, of universes. So I think to try to take that in is almost impossible, yet, I suppose, we must try, on this tiny planet, which I have sailed around, circumnavigated \u2014 to be set down here, however, to try to, one would hope, do our best while we\u2019re here. And I think, really, our impulse is to do our best, however often we might lose sight of it, and try to be kind-ish to one another while we\u2019re still here. The day our son is due is the very day the redknots are meant to touch down on their long haul from Chile to the Arctic Circle, where they\u2019ll nest on the tundra within a few feet Of where they were hatched. Forty or fifty thousand of them are meant to drop in along Delaware Bay. They time their arrival on these shores to coincide with the horseshoe crabs laying their eggs in the sand. Smallish birds to begin with, the redknots have now lost half their weight. Eating the eggs of the horseshoe crabs is what gives them the strength to go on, forty or fifty thousand of them getting up all at once as if for a rock concert encore. Paul Muldoon reading his poem \u201CRedknots.\u201D You can hear or watch him reading this and other poems at onbeing.org. Paul Muldoon holds the Howard G.B. Clark chair in the Humanities at Princeton University. He\u2019s been poetry editor of The New Yorker since 2007.
