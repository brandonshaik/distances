  "fullText": "I\u2019d been looking forward to meeting Desmond Tutu for years. And in those years, the world continued to evolve. So did the perspective of this Nobel laureate and archbishop emeritus. Tutu helped galvanize South Africa\u2019s improbably peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy. Yet inequity and violence mark today\u2019s South Africa in old forms and new. Desmond Tutu was also a leader in the religious drama that transfigured South African Christianity. But the Anglican Communion of Desmond Tutu is now caught in its own global conflict around sexual orientation and leadership. We discuss all these things this hour. We explore how Desmond Tutu\u2019s understanding of God and humanity has unfolded through this history he helped shape and even through his very present friendship with the Dalai Lama. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. I interviewed Desmond Tutu in the woods of southern Michigan where he was on retreat in 2010, just months before he announced his retirement from public life. He disarmed me from the outset with his famously mischievous humor. I\u2019d brought along a bowl of dried mangos, having been told by his staff that he is, quote \u201Cmad about dried mango.\u201D And he noticed them as we were finding our seats before I could say anything. There we go. And I notice, I mean, you\u2019ve got a glass of water; I\u2019ve got a glass of water. But then you have dried fruit. Why do you rate dried fruit and I not? I brought this for you. Oh, you \u2026 Because your office told us that you love dried mango. Oh, you beautiful thing. Oh. You are a star. Can we say a prayer first? Yes, please. Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of thy faithful people and kindle in them the fire of thy love. Send forth thy spirit and they shall be made and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Amen. This hymn of the Xhosa language, \u201CGod Bless Africa,\u201D is the joint national anthem of modern South Africa. But when Desmond Tutu was born in 1931, it was an anthem of the anti-apartheid African National Congress. When the Dutch Colonial Afrikaner Nationalist Party came to power in South Africa in 1948, it decreed white supremacy in perpetuity, codifying the policy of apartheid, which literally translates as \u201Capartness.\u201D Comprehensive separation and brutalization of the 80 percent majority population of non-whites became the law of the land. Desmond Tutu grew up, like other black children, in a ghetto township marked by deprivation. He stresses that his childhood was not devoid of joy. Children adapt; he played with his friends. But there were many moments which he traces as early stirrings of his sense of injustice. And I wondered, as we began to speak, if Desmond Tutu\u2019s personal spirit of resistance might also have roots in the Xhosa ancestry of his father. These were some of the earliest people to encounter and rebel against white intruders in the South African Cape some 300 years ago, the backdrop to all of the history Desmond Tutu has lived through and shaped. You know, they recently did a genome sequencing and found that through my mother I\u2019m related to the San people, who are the earliest inhabitants of southern Africa and probably some of the earliest human beings. But I think, I mean, that the later resistance was because of various factors. You know, the people who influenced me, the schools that I went to. You know, at one time I worked for the World Council of Churches and we were based in London. I came from Africa. There was someone from Latin America, and he introduced me to Latin American liberation theology. And I came to visit for the first time in the United States and here encountered black theology. So all of that was a very significant part of what helped to open my eyes. And you know as I steeped myself in your story I was so struck by the echoes of Dietrich Bonhoeffer theologically. The echoes and the parallels and you know there are very strong echoes of this German theologian who eventually became involved in a plot to assassinate hitler. And it seems like you also found yourself in a place and time where you were called to a very extreme understanding of, as the bracelet says, \u201CWhat Jesus Would Do.\u201D Obviously I mean when you are living your life and you have this and that influence at the time when it happens you don\u2019t sit back and say now this is a major influence and it\u2019s going to turn me in to this or that. But you see I went to train for the priesthood in a seminary that was run by a religious community and one of my mentors was Trevor Huddleston who was just an incredible human being. He had come from England and was a priest in Sophiatown, the black township to the west of Johannesburg. And when the apartheid government wanted to destroy Sophiatown he was amongst those who resisted like nobody\u2019s business. And those are people who touched my life. Mercifully, there isn\u2019t anything like the so-called self-made person. Right. You had spiritual companions. Yes. They are more than that. I mean, they are people who helped to form me. And then discovering that the Bible could be such dynamite. I subsequently used to say if these white people had intended keeping us under they shouldn\u2019t have given us the Bible. Because, whoa, I mean, it\u2019s almost as if it is written specifically just for your situation. I mean, the many parts of it that were so germane, so utterly to the point for us \u2026 Can you recall one of those early discoveries as the Bible as dynamite? Some teaching that you suddenly saw as so relevant? Well, it\u2019s actually right the very first thing. I mean, when you discover that apartheid sought to mislead people into believing that what gave value to human beings was a biological irrelevance, really, skin color or ethnicity, and you saw how the scriptures say it is because we are created in the image of God, that each one of us is a God-carrier. No matter what our physical circumstances may be, no matter how awful, no matter how deprived you could be, it doesn\u2019t take away from you this intrinsic worth. One saw just how significant it was. Although I was a bishop, I was working now for the Southern Council of Churches and had a small parish in Soweto. Most of my parishioners were domestic workers, not people who are very well educated. But I would say to them, \u201CYou know, mama, when they ask who are you\u201D \u2014 you see, the white employer most frequently didn\u2019t use the person\u2019s name. They said the person\u2019s name was too difficult. And so most Africans, women would be called \u201CAnnie\u201D and most black men really, you were \u201Cboy.\u201D And I would say to them, \u201CWhen they ask who are you, you say, \u2018Me? I\u2019m a God-carrier. I\u2019m God\u2019s partner. I\u2019m created in the image of God.'\u201D And you could see those dear old ladies as they walked out of church on that occasion as if they were on cloud nine. You know, they walked with their backs slightly straighter. And, yeah, it was amazing. I think much of the world, and this has to do with my profession of journalism as well \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 experienced the events in South Africa, those decades leading up to the end of apartheid, primarily as political happenings. But there was a great religious drama at the heart of it, right? Yes. So on the one hand, the church, the Dutch Reform Church, the primary church in South Africa, sanctioned and sustained apartheid to near the end. And also, as you say, there was this parallel drama going on of religion, theology, the Bible becoming a great force of liberation. Well, one of the wonderful things was how in fact we had this interfaith cooperation \u2014 Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus. And now, when you hear people speak disparagingly about, say, Islam, you say they\u2019ve forgotten the men that that faith inspired people to great acts of courage. And that coalition, those friendships, were they building in those latter decades of the 20th century? You discovered the thing you were fighting against was too big for divided churches, for divided religious community. And each of the different faith communities realized some of the very significant central teachings about the worth of a human being, about the unacceptability of injustice and oppression. Many times, actually, it was quite exhilarating. It was fun. Right. And then there was that momentous occasion, I think was it 1990 when there was the first conference in 30 years to bring together the Dutch Reform leaders with these other churches? Yes. And there was this heartfelt apology. This was the 1990s, so things had started to break open, but there was still a lot of potential for danger, right? And here\u2019s what you said: \u201CWe have been on a kind of roller coaster ride, reaching the heights of euphoria that a new dispensation was virtually here, and then touching the depths of despair because of the mindless violence and carnage that seemed to place the whole negotiation process in considerable jeopardy. And just as we were recovering our breath, the god of surprises played his most extraordinary and incredible card.\u201D Did I say that? You said that. It\u2019s beautiful. Yes. Well, I mean, God is a god of surprises. I mean, I\u2019ve sometimes said God\u2019s sense of humor is quite something, you know. I mean, an illustration of the sort of craziness \u2014 they had dealt with somebody called Beyers Naude. He was an Afrikaner who at one point said, \u201CNo, apartheid can\u2019t be justified scripturally,\u201D and for this he was turfed out of his church. I mean, they expelled him because they said he was a traitor. And so he joined up with blacks and others who were opposing. When freedom came, there was a road in Johannesburg that had been named after D.F. Malan. In 1948, Milan became the first nationalist prime minister. And so they had this D.F. Malan driveway. In 1994\u201395, the name was changed to Beyers Naude Highway. I mean, you would almost imagine them in heaven sort of rolling in the aisles. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CDesmond Tutu\u2019s God of Surprises.\u201D The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which he chaired, met formally from 1995 to 1998. The TRC, as it was known, was conceived as apartheid unraveled in the early 1990s. Its basic premise was that any individual, whatever he or she had done, was eligible for amnesty if they would fully disclose and confess their crimes. The commission investigated human rights violations by both architects and opponents of apartheid. Victims were invited to tell their stories and witness confessions. Many families came to know for the first time when and how their loved ones died. I wonder, in the years that followed and in your experience of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, what did you learn about why, as you said, one of the hardest things for human beings to do is to say, \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D I mean, what did you learn about forgiveness three-dimensionally that you didn\u2019t know before? One was that I was amazed, first of all, at how powerful an instrument it is being able to tell your story. You know, I supposed psychiatrists understand that better than we. Just being able to tell your story, you could see in the number of people who for so long had been sort of just anonymous, faceless non-entities just being given the opportunity for something to rehabilitate them. But it actually was a healing thing. We had a black young man who had been blinded by police action in his township, and he came to tell his story. When he finished, one of the TRC panel asked him, \u201CHey, how do you feel?\u201D And a broad smile broke over his face and he was still blind but he said, \u201CYou have given me back my eyes.\u201D You felt so humbled that people would feel that that was how the healing for him would have taken place. You know, one of the things that constantly amazed us was the remarkable magnanimity of people. All people, black, white, Africans, and Americans. I mean, human beings can leave you speechless, really. I mean, they can leave you speechless by the horrible things they do \u2026 Right. \u2026 but they also leave you speechless with the incredible things. We saw so many times people who ought to have been bristling with bitterness and anger, when they meet the perpetrator, actually being able to embrace. And you were asking about the difficulty. Yes, it is difficult. And when we started, we looked at the legislation and the legislation did not require a perpetrator who applied for amnesty to express even remorse, and we were very upset and said, \u201CBut, I mean, why not say they\u2019ve got to say sorry or something?\u201D Right. But we discovered, I mean, that actually the legislators were a lot smarter. Because had they insisted that it was a condition to get amnesty, each time somebody said, \u201CI am sorry. I am very sorry,\u201D we would\u2019ve said, \u201CAh, he\u2019s just putting that on.\u201D Right. As it happened, despite the fact that it was not a requirement, when people were applying for amnesty, almost always they would turn to the victims or the survivors or the family if the person had been killed, and they would turn to them and say, \u201CPlease. We know it\u2019s very difficult but please forgive.\u201D And, as I say, almost always the victims would. You know, in conversations I\u2019ve had across the years of people who were around the Truth and Reconciliation Commission or were involved in it, they also talk, though, about it was truth and reconciliation and that those are different things and that they also learned about the distance that has to be walked between truth and even forgiveness \u2014 and reconciliation, which seems to be so much. Yeah. To need so much time. I wonder where your thinking and your experience is now on that. Has reconciliation come to South Africa? Yes. What is the process that\u2019s playing itself out now? I\u2019ve always given people the example when they ask that question \u2014 \u201CHave you achieved reconciliation?\u201D \u2014 and I say, just look at Germany. West Germany and East Germany were separated maybe, let us say, 50 years. They speak the same language. They are the same ethnic group. Go to Germany even today and ask, has reunification helped? Are you reconciled? And it\u2019s amazing to discover that they are still alienated from one another. Now that\u2019s people speaking the same language. That\u2019s people who have been separated for about 50 years. We had this separation for three centuries. Right. And it was a much more violent and brutal separation. About 300 years. We now have 11 official languages, so you can see, I mean, how many ethnic groups we have to have expected we would achieve reconciliation is the height of na\u00EFvet\u00E9, I think. The act that set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has as its title \u201CThe Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation.\u201D It\u2019s the promotion. It doesn\u2019t say the achievement. Right. Right. It\u2019s the process you\u2019re setting in motion. That reconciliation is a process. It\u2019s not something that is just an event. And we constantly were saying it is a national project where every South African has to make their contribution and it is a process. Not even the best commission could have achieved it for us. There is a lot of violence in South African society right now, and that violence is connected, as you say, to these 300 years that couldn\u2019t possibly be resolved by the Commission. Yeah. I mean, how do you think about what\u2019s happening now and that as part of this project? I think, I mean, that we have very gravely underestimated the damage that apartheid inflicted on all of us. You know, the damage to our psyches, the damage that has made \u2014 I mean, it shocked me. I went to Nigeria when I was working for the World Council of Churches, and I was due to fly to Jos. And so I go to Lagos airport and I get onto the plane and the two pilots in the cockpit are both black. And whee, I just grew inches. You know, it was fantastic because we had been told that blacks can\u2019t do this. Right. And we have a smooth takeoff and then we hit the mother and father of turbulence. I mean, it was quite awful, scary. Do you know, I can\u2019t believe it but the first thought that came to my mind was, \u201CHey, there\u2019s no white men in that cockpit. Are those blacks going to be able to make it?\u201D And of course, they obviously made it \u2014 here I am. But the thing is, I had not known that I was damaged to the extent of thinking that somehow actually what those white people who had kept drumming into us in South Africa about our being inferior, about our being incapable, it had lodged somewhere in me. Right. Right. And so whilst we have had this process, which is an important process, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are without it. We certainly are needing a great deal more, the most important being a recognition that we are damaged. We are wounded people. We accepted it to some extent. I mean, the commission realized that we were not a cut up of fellow South Africans, we were but wounded healers. And, you know, we used to make sure when we had these public hearings that the furniture demonstrated it. We didn\u2019t sit on a platform higher than, but we deliberately sat on a level with the victims. At onbeing.org you can watch my entire conversation with Desmond Tutu. Here he is speaking at the National Press Club in 1999, the year after the TRC concluded its formal convening. We had this remarkable process of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. When people who had suffered grievously, whom you could have said had a divine right to be angry and filled with a lust for revenge came and they told their stories and so frequently you wanted to take off your shoes because you said, \u201CI\u2019m standing on holy ground.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: \u201CDesmond Tutu\u2019s God of Surprises,\u201D my conversation with the South African archbishop emeritus and Nobel laureate. We\u2019re exploring his long view of the history he\u2019s helped shape and how his understanding of God and humanity has unfolded through it. He\u2019s been talking about reconciliation as an ongoing national project, not something that was perfected and completed with the end of the truth and reconciliation process in 1998. I think a lot these days about colonialism, which, as you say, it\u2019s not just 50 years of apartheid; it\u2019s 300 years. Yeah. And it\u2019s so ironic because also Western support for South Africa had to do with South Africa as a bulwark against communism and we \u2014 I mean, here I\u2019m saying \u201Cwe\u201D \u2014 in the West have forgotten this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, when things get rough, we also forget that we\u2019ve been free for only about 16, 20 \u2014 16 years, 1994. And how long have you been free? Three hundred years, something. Right. And I\u2019ve sometimes said well, you know, the history of Europe, of the West, gives me a great deal of hope. Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, when you think that you\u2019ve had two world wars, you\u2019ve produced the Holocaust, you\u2019re produced ethnic cleansing, you\u2019ve had dictatorships, I mean, in Spain, in Portugal, in Greece. Yes. So, I say, I mean, look now at how you have advanced. So there\u2019s hope for us. Yeah. I like that. I wonder also, is it right you were 63 years old when you voted for the first time? What was that like? How do you describe falling in love? I mean, people asked then when we voted for the first time. It was an incredible experience. For you, going to the poll box is really a political act. For us, it was a religious act. It was a spiritual experience because, you know, you walked into the polling booth one person with all of the history of oppression and injustice and all the baggage that we were carrying and you walk and you make your mark and you put the ballot into the box and you emerge on the other side. And you are a different person. You are transfigured. Now you actually count in your own country. You \u2014 hey, I mean, it really was a cloud nine experience. We were transformed from ciphers into persons. You know, one thing that I feel also runs throughout your writing is how freedom in terms of politics, I mean, this freedom to vote, is absolutely something you demanded and needed to demand, and yet you also knew people across the years who were free while they were imprisoned. And there\u2019s also this specter now of people who are politically free but not free in, I don\u2019t know, maybe the deepest Christian sense, for example. Yes. So I wonder if you\u2019d reflect a little bit on what you\u2019ve learned about the limits of politics. Well, you know, I mean, you\u2019ve got prepositions. The preposition \u201Cfrom\u201D \u2014 you are free from and then you are free for. We have gone to being free from, which turns out to be one of the slightly easier things to get to do, although it took so long. Yes. The being free for, I tell you, is tough. You know? So what is the freedom for what that you now wish for, for your people? I think many of us were involved. I often say you know what? We didn\u2019t struggle in order just to change the complexion of those who sit in the Union Buildings. The Union Buildings are something like your capitol and so on. Yeah. It wasn\u2019t to change the complexion; it was to change the quality of our community, society. That we wanted to see a society that was a compassionate society, a caring society, a society where you might not necessarily be madly rich but you knew that you counted. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve got \u2014 yeah. I mean, we\u2019ve got a number of the things, sort of material political things, not all of them. I mean, we have levels of poverty at home that are unacceptable. There\u2019s the crime, there\u2019s disease. We still do not, I think, have the kind of place where you say I really am proud to be here. I know that even when I don\u2019t have a big bank balance I count, I matter. What we have found is that original sin actually doesn\u2019t know very much about racial discrimination. Original sin infects all of us. I mean, when you see how so soon people have become corrupt, it leaves you feeling sad. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CDesmond Tutu\u2019s God of Surprises.\u201D Now retired as the archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu has become a somewhat controversial figure in the global religious landscape by insisting that sexual orientation, like racial equality, is a basic human right. In 2010, he published a book called Made for Goodness, in collaboration with his youngest daughter, Mpho, who is herself an Episcopal priest. You know, words that you use, like hope, and hope as opposed to optimism, I\u2019m with you there, that it\u2019s different, and goodness, which is in the title of this new book you\u2019ve written with your daughter, Mpho. Say as a journalist, it\u2019s very hard to make those words as interesting and to make those words and the people you\u2019re pointing at and the situations that are attached to those words, to make them seem as telling, as substantial, as violence, injustice, evil, war \u2014 have you thought about that? Well, yeah, but I have to say, you know, if you are devoid of hope then roll over and disappear quietly. Hope says, hey, things can, things will, be better because God has intended for it to be so. You know? At no point will evil and injustice and oppression and all of the negative things have the last word. And, yes, I mean, there\u2019s no question about the reality of evil, of injustice, of suffering, but at the center of this existence is a heart beating with love. You know, that you and I and all of us are incredible. I mean, we really are remarkable things that we are, as a matter of fact, made for goodness. And it\u2019s not a smart aleck thing to say; it\u2019s just a fact. Because all of us, even when we have degenerated, know that the wrong isn\u2019t what we should be, isn\u2019t what we should be doing. We\u2019re fantastic. I mean, we really are amazing. You know, you told a story at a conference in 1990 about a man during the apartheid era and of his village that had been demolished. People were being uprooted and he prayed, \u201CThank you God, for loving us.\u201D And you wrote, \u201CI\u2019ve never understood that prayer,\u201D but I think people might look at you and the life you\u2019ve lived and also, you know, the bad things that continue to happen in South Africa and all the rest of the world, and say, \u201CThis guy says this is a moral universe?\u201D And there\u2019s this line you\u2019ve just echoed, you\u2019ve written this so many times, \u201CGod is in charge,\u201D and they might also say, \u201CHow can he say that?\u201D I mean, tell me, you\u2019ve been saying God is in charge for a long time, for decades. And so what do you mean when you say that and what that means to you, has that changed? Has that evolved? Well, I mean, you must add that I\u2019ve sometimes said to God, \u201CIt would be nice for you to make it slightly more obvious that you\u2019re in charge.\u201D Right. But don\u2019t you believe this? I mean, when you encounter somebody good \u2014 just take the Dalai Lama. Right. Your friend the Dalai Lama. Yes. Just take the Dalai Lama. Now, this is someone who\u2019s been in exile for over 50 years. How should he really be? I mean, he\u2019s missing his beloved Tibet. He\u2019s missing his people. He\u2019s been made to live a life that he wouldn\u2019t really want to live. By rights, I mean, when you meet him you expect somebody who is bitter, who, if you mention the Chinese, will wish the worst possible to happen to them. But you meet him; he\u2019s actually quite mischievous. I mean, he\u2019s fun. He\u2019s laughing. And people flock to hear him. And, I mean, he doesn\u2019t even speak English properly, you know. And they still flock to hear him. No, no. I mean, I must tell you, actually, I\u2019m not jealous. But, I mean, look at the number \u2014 I mean, he can fill Central Park. Mm-hmm. So, I mean, this is another question I wanted to ask you. I\u2019ve talked about, you know, how has your sense of reconciliation developed and, you know, how has your sense of Christian truth evolved through experiences you\u2019ve had coming out of apartheid with the Nobel Peace Prize. For example, your friendship with the Dalai Lama, this great Tibetan Buddhist leader. Yes. Do you really think that God would say, \u201CDalai Lama, you really are a great guy, man. What a shame you\u2019re not a Christian.\u201D? I somehow don\u2019t think so. I think God is just thrilled because no faith, not even the Christian faith, can ever encompass God or even be able to communicate who God is. Only God can do that. This is a big subject to introduce right here at the end but does it strike you, the irony that in many ways the British were very complicit in this 300 years that your country is now recovering from \u2026 Yeah. Yeah. \u2026 and you are now an archbishop in the Anglican Church. Isn\u2019t that an example of God\u2019s sense of humor? It\u2019s really amazing. It\u2019s amazing. And that church now, globally, is very divided over issues of sexuality, and you have applied your experience in apartheid in a pretty provocative way in terms of where you come out on that. Well, you know, there are, yes, many in Africa in the Anglican Church who hold views that I wouldn\u2019t hold myself over this. And I\u2019ve often said what a shame. I mean, really, what a disgrace that the church of God in the face of so much suffering in the world, in the face of conflict, of corruption, of all of the awful things, what is our obsession? Our obsession is not ministering to a world that is aching. Our obsession is about sexual orientation. I\u2019m sure, I mean, the Lord of this church looking down at us must weep and say, \u201CJust what did I do wrong now?\u201D Because our church has been, in many ways, wonderful. I mean, you know, in its being comprehensive. Right, right, right. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve boasted about, the comprehensiveness of our church, where we see we hold points of view that are often diametrically opposed. Right. But we remain in the same family. So your work continues, your work of reconciliation. No. I\u2019m retired. OK. Desmond Tutu is South African Archbishop Emeritus. He has a wonderful new book out this month, a kind of handbook on forgiveness called, The Book of Forgiving. You can watch my playful encounter with Desmond Tutu from start to finish on our website, onbeing.org. You\u2019ll find links there to all of the music we used in this program, some of the soundtrack if you will of South Africa\u2019s vivid culture and history. I actually began talking with Desmond Tutu about some of this music after our interview ended. I asked him about one Xhosa Christian hymn in particular that I\u2019d read was played at his 50th wedding anniversary celebration. He couldn\u2019t immediately remember how it goes, and he and a colleague began to trade snippets of lyric and melody back and forth across the room. Ooh/ da na na na na na na/ da na na na/ da na na na na/ da na de da dam/ [speaks Xhosa] I love that. Well, that\u2019s beautiful. Thank you.
