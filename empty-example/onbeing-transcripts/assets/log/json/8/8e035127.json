  "fullText": "I wasn\u2019t aware of the mission statement of Wikipedia until recently: \u201CImagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.\u201D And a conversation with Jimmy Wales \u2013 one of the architects of that philosophy and the project and global community that has grown up around it \u2013 is full of surprises. What Wikipedia has been learning for 15 years now \u2013 about communally navigating facts and truth while honoring the integrity of many points of view \u2014 feels relevant right now. And I\u2019ve never interviewed anyone who uses the word \u201Ckindness\u201D more naturally and insistently than Jimmy Wales. Seth Godin used this phrase when he talked about what he sees in Wikipedia, \u201CThe insane power of the well-organized crowd.\u201D Which \u2014 again, it\u2019s like \u2014 it takes the language of democracy to a slightly new 21st-century place. I like that, \u201Corganized,\u201D because a lot of what people refer to as online community in various places is not organized, and it\u2019s atomistic is what I call it. So, an organized crowd is a group of people who are working together under a set of agreed principles for a common end, and hopefully doing that with a certain modicum of kindness to each other and thoughtfulness. And that is very special and has to be nurtured. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Jimmy Wales worked as a future and options trader early in his career and has created for-profit companies, but Wikipedia remains passionately non-profit. He lives between Florida and London, and grew up in Alabama. I\u2019ve seen you referred to a few times that you grew up an atheist in Alabama, which is kind of poetic. And also a little counterintuitive. A little, yeah. Mm-hmm. And your mother ran a two-room schoolhouse. Is that right? Yes. Yeah, exactly. That\u2019s so interesting. Yeah, it was a very unusual, I would say, educational upbringing. Two-room schoolhouse, so like Abraham Lincoln or something. And we had four grades in each room \u2014 first through fourth grade, and then fifth through eighth grade. We also had a kindergarten, so it was technically a three-room. And yeah, I went there the whole time. And in my grade, there were four kids, so very small school. So we had a lot of flexibility and time to explore activities at our own choosing. So I\u2019m always interested in this question, whoever I\u2019m speaking with, of how they would describe the spiritual background of their childhood. And it seems to me that there are these virtues and values that run through your work about a kind of \u2014 there\u2019s a kind of faith in community, and in human kindness, and kind of a trust in the goodness of people. I\u2019m curious about where the roots of that are in this earliest life of yours. Yeah, I do think there is something to that. I mean, certainly growing up in the South, my parents were very, very nice people, and we were always taught to be very nice people. And there is that kind of community sensibility I would say. Yeah. And yeah, and so that was, I would say, a big part of how I was brought up. I mean, I just remember my father lamenting, because we lived in the big city of Huntsville, which was around 200,000 people, that unlike where he grew up in the countryside, when you met people driving down the street, they didn\u2019t wave at you, which is sort of funny. I\u2019m like, \u201CWell, Dad, there\u2019s a lot of them driving by, so\u2026\u201D Right. But it was that kind of thing. Like, people should be nice. And my father was a grocery store manager. And as such, he had had many, many, many people had worked for him over the years, young people. And everywhere we would go, people would come up to Dad, and they knew him and so forth, and always joked that he should run for mayor. But he never did. Yeah. And where do you trace the roots of your imagination about what an encyclopedia is and what it does in the world? I mean, did you have World Book Encyclopedia when you were growing up? Yeah, yeah. We had the World Book at home from a very young age. My mother, in the classic style, bought it from a door-to-door salesperson when I was a baby. We\u2019ll have to tell our kids those stories, and they won\u2019t believe us, right? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, there\u2019s a great thing I show in my speeches. It\u2019s a tweet from a school librarian who said, I asked one of my students if she knew what an encyclopedia was. And she said, is it something like Wikipedia? Yeah. Right. So, for kids today, Wikipedia is ubiquitous. But yeah, in terms of growing up with the encyclopedia \u2014 and later on, of course, we had Britannica \u2014 it was something that I really loved as a child and read a lot. I can\u2019t say I read it cover to cover, although I did have that ambition at times. But I read a lot of things in the encyclopedia. And I always liked, anything I wanted to know, to go and get a summary of it. And along with the annual book, they would send you stickers. And you could open up the original encyclopedia, and say there was an updated entry about the moon \u2014 people have landed on the moon \u2014 they update the moon entry. And then you would go and you would stick the sticker in the main book. So you\u2019d look up moon, and it was say, \u201COh, this article is out of date. Go and look in the 1976 edition.\u201D And so now I think back on that, and that was the sort of the first editing the encyclopedia, by sticking stickers in it. Right. But they were stickers that somebody else had crafted, had written. Someone else had crafted, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you started Wikipedia in 2001. I just wanted \u2014 that\u2019s the date you use as well? 2001? Yeah, mm-hmm. And I\u2019m just curious about \u2014 just in terms of being something that is just woven into the fabric of life, and that kids grow up knowing about and using. And when you reflect on it, it\u2019s really a very short time. And so, what was the germ of the idea? Like, what came first? What set this off to become the thing it became? Yeah. So, I had been really impacted by the explosion of the internet. My family had a computer when I was \u2014 very early. Before the IBM PC came out, we had a TRS80 from Radio Shack computer, and the Commodore PET computer, and so forth. And one of the things that I saw in graduate school was the growth of open-source software, free software. And this is software that\u2019s created primarily by volunteers, and they release on the internet under a completely free license. Right. And one thing that a lot of people don\u2019t know unless you work in the industry is that a lot of the really fantastic software that runs the internet, GNU Linux, Apache Pearl, MySQL, PHP, all of the programming languages and things are open source projects that are created by volunteer programmers collaborating online. So I was watching that thing grow. And of course, when I first heard about it, I thought, \u201CWell, that\u2019s an interesting idea, but obviously that\u2019s just going to be a small hobby thing.\u201D But as it became more and more impactful, and it was more and more becoming a fundamental part of the internet, I thought, \u201CGee, that kind of collaboration could extend beyond just software into all kinds of cultural works.\u201D And it sort of makes sense that it would start with software, because programmers who wanted to share their work with each other could build the tools that they needed to do that. So they could build their own tools, and they have version control software, so they can check in and out their changes and work together collaboratively. And for the rest of us, if we wanted to collaborate on some kind of a document, the best you could do is email a Word document or something like that, which is a nightmare. Right. And so, I thought, basically, we need some tools. We need to figure out how to make this work. And I had the idea of an encyclopedia. And I got very excited about it. And thought it\u2019s the kind of thing that people could collaborate on. It\u2019s fairly straightforward to understand what it should look like. And that was how we got started. But of course, in the initial version, called Nupedia, we didn\u2019t have all the ideas of how to do it, and how to build a community, and what kind of software they needed, and so forth. Did you have, from the beginning, this kind of mission statement that you\u2019re providing \u201Cfree access to the sum of all human knowledge for all people?\u201D Was that there at the beginning or did it evolve? Well, yeah, that concept was there at the beginning. The actual sort of famous tagline, \u201CImagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge\u201D \u2014 that I came up with in about \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly \u2014 2004, 2005. Maybe a little earlier, maybe 2003. Anyway, I know where I was. I was in Berlin. It was my first time out of the U.S. I\u2019d been invited to a conference to speak in Berlin, which was mind-boggling to me that anybody would want me to come all the way to Europe, and give a talk, and sort of had to sort of sum up what it was we were doing. But the concept, that mission statement, was with us from the very beginning. And it\u2019s very straightforward and simple on one hand, and it\u2019s grand and audacious on the other, \u201Cthe sum of all human knowledge.\u201D Yeah. And I do think that is part of why it\u2019s been successful, I think had I set out to sort of \u2014 \u201CLet\u2019s write an encyclopedia article about every state in the U.S.\u201D \u2014 right? It\u2019s not that inspiring of a goal. It\u2019s just a small little thing. And I think the fact that it\u2019s a big idea for everyone on the planet is part of what motivates the volunteers. And when we talk to the volunteers and say, \u201CWell, why do you do this?\u201D one of the things they point to is that it\u2019s being part of something that is \u2014 it feels good. You\u2019re doing something productive for the whole world, and it\u2019s meaningful. And I do think that people really \u2014 they want to spend their time doing something meaningful. Yeah, and that in itself is \u2014 I\u2019m so with you on that. And yet, it\u2019s also kind of a bold statement in the 21st century for a public figure to make. Yeah. I mean, it is. The idea of free access to the sum of all human knowledge is a controversial statement in places that actively practice censorship and an attempt to forcibly control the flow of information. Yeah. But I think other things about Wikipedia are perhaps, not controversial, but I think unusual in our current environment. We unfortunately live in a media culture that\u2019s very, very different from the calm neutral style of Wikipedia \u2014 I mean, we try really hard to be calm and neutral. Obviously, we\u2019re human beings. We don\u2019t always do it. Yes. But \u2014 right. And instead, we have, in many parts, quite an inflammatory and divisive media culture. That\u2019s unfortunate, I think. And leads to\u2026 And bad for us. Bad for all people. Yeah. Bad. Yes, very bad. And so, yes. You are quite a champion globally now when it comes to censorship. But I also see something somewhat subversive \u2014 or let\u2019s use the word \u201Ccounter-cultural\u201D \u2014 in the insistence on people wanting to do something meaningful, that this is a space in which people engage as volunteers to do something meaningful, a digital space. And I wonder if \u2014 it\u2019s not that meaningful things don\u2019t happen on all kinds of digital spaces. They do. But this has kind of a \u2014 in the DNA of the ethos, I just I don\u2019t think that could have been possible if you had shifted from being a non-profit to be a commercial enterprise. I just don\u2019t know if a commercial enterprise could have retained that commitment to that experience for people. Well, I mean, I certainly think it would be difficult. Mm-hmm. And it\u2019s something I have \u2014 I co-founded Wikia, which is now a top-20 website. And it\u2019s mostly fan sites about entertainment, and gaming, and so forth. And it\u2019s very passionately community-oriented, but it\u2019s an ad-supported website. And in terms of the community, the community\u2019s engaged in it because they\u2019re passionate about the topic. It doesn\u2019t have that same kind of charitable public service feel about what they\u2019re doing. Although it is community-minded. Yeah. I mean, people, they\u2019re doing it because they want to help out other people who like the same game they like or whatever it might be. But I do think it\u2019s hard. And I do think, certainly, one of the great benefits for Wikipedia of being a charity is that we care as much about the next million readers in Africa as we care about the next million readers in California. Mm-hmm. And so it\u2019s one of the things that people say, \u201CWell, why don\u2019t you put ads in Wikipedia? Why keep having to raise money as a charity?\u201D And one of the things I say is, no matter how much I believe that we would continue, or that I would want us to continue, just in the DNA of the organization, organizations always tend to follow the money. And it\u2019s not that Wikipedia would turn evil, but it would certainly turn less interested in the developing world. It would become more interested in what you\u2019re reading at Wikipedia. So if everybody\u2019s reading about Elizabethan Poetry, there\u2019s nothing to sell them. We really want you to read about hotels in Las Vegas and things that have good ad revenue. And so suddenly you do. No matter how hard you try, it would change the incentives of the organization to try to change the shape of Wikipedia rather than being this really pure, community-driven public service mission. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with internet entrepreneur and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. I do this big expansive conversation about this question of what it means to be human, how we want to live, and how all kinds of modern people are exploring that and reframing it in all of our fields. And quite a few people across the years have used Jimmy Wales and Wikipedia as an example, not just of what Wikipedia does, but of changing models of how the internet \u2014 and this model in particular that it\u2019s made possible \u2014 is shifting the way these basic human endeavors, like making, and leading, and learning, and belonging. And I want to talk about that with you, but I actually want to start with \u2014 the other thing that happens when people talk about Wikipedia is they explain it, right? And I\u2019d kind of like to ask you to just give a basic explanation of what happens because I\u2019m not sure. People use Wikipedia. I\u2019m not really sure they know, but the numbers are staggering. And I\u2019m not sure if the numbers I wrote down this morning are today\u2019s numbers: more than 15 billion page views a month, 7,000 new articles every day, 80,000 unpaid volunteers worldwide. I wonder if you would just \u2014 let\u2019s say, someone from Mars met you. Just giving a straightforward explanation of what Wikipedia is, what happens? How would you start to do that? Yeah, I mean, I think we can think of this in a couple of different ways. So one, we can talk about what Wikipedia is, the end result, the encyclopedia. But that, as you say, lots of people who are readers already understand that, and then that\u2019s pretty straightforward. I think what\u2019s harder is the Wikipedia community and understanding how that works and who they are. And it\u2019s a really remarkable and amazing group of people. I think one of the things that people should understand is that it\u2019s not about the software. The software is important and how the software works, but it\u2019s really about the culture in the community. It\u2019s about people having the right spirit, about people taking responsibility. So the way it works is Wikipedia is very open. Anybody can come and edit. But every time someone makes an edit, other people will review it. They either review it very quickly, and that would be people who are patrolling recent changes. Or lots of people have on their watch list the things they\u2019ve edited in the past or areas that they\u2019re interested in, and they\u2019ll log in and they\u2019ll review changes over the last few days. And when people disagree about an edit, then they have a discussion. And the talk pages are really one of the most interesting places on Wikipedia. And this is an area where people often don\u2019t understand. So if we have an entry on Barack Obama, then the discussion page is not a general chat room about Barack Obama. All the discussions should be focused around, \u201CHow do we improve this article?\u201D And so if you like Barack Obama, or you don\u2019t like Barack Obama, that\u2019s more or less irrelevant to the discussion because this is about improving the article. And indeed, if you\u2019re a good Wikipedian, hopefully, even in the debates about what should be included, people can\u2019t tell if you like Barack Obama or not because it\u2019s about the quality of the article. And there\u2019s a lot of mechanisms in the community. So people get elected to be administrators, and the administrators have additional powers to block people or temporarily lock entries. But even those powers are subject to checks and balances. And everything that an administrator does is publicly visible. So if an administrator blocks someone, there\u2019s very strict rules. You can\u2019t block someone just because you\u2019re having an argument with them. That\u2019s a really terrible faux pas as an administrator. And then we have further things. We have the arbitration committee, which \u2014 they handle the more longer-term and intractable disputes. And so if people can\u2019t get along, and they can\u2019t figure out what to do, and there\u2019s been a series of page-locking, unlocking, and a big brawl, then the arbitration committee will hear a case regarding what to do about this entry. And they can impose binding solutions. And sometimes, the solution is basically a topic ban for 10 people on both sides to say, \u201CAll of you people are just too excitable about this topic. You can\u2019t edit here for one year.\u201D Yeah. And getting in other Wikipedians who are maybe less emotionally invested in the topic. But it\u2019s an imperfect process. But it\u2019s like most democratic processes, i.e. it\u2019s been designed to have checks and balances, it goes wrong sometimes, and there\u2019s always some kind of drama going on. Again, because it\u2019s the human condition involved. Yeah. Because it\u2019s the human condition. Yeah. Exactly. So we can describe the proper functioning of a municipal police force, and a municipal government and we can think about, OK, yes, well, the police do need to have special powers to arrest people. But we know police don\u2019t always do the right things, and then we have to have trouble about that and so and so forth. So, it\u2019s a messy kind of world behind the scenes, but it more or less works and certainly it\u2019s been incredibly productive to push all the decision-making out into the community about these kinds of things. Yeah. And you use the word democratic, and it is democratic, but it\u2019s a new way of being democratic. And it\u2019s actually not the way our most visible democratic political processes work these days. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that we say at Wikipedia, one of our many sort of mysterious slogans is that \u201CWikipedia is not a democracy.\u201D And what we mean by that is a simple vote doesn\u2019t always carry the day. Yeah. There are certain principles that are about improving the quality of the encyclopedia. The reason we say this is sometimes people in some sub community out there on the internet, they get very upset about something, and they say, \u201COh, we\u2019ll all rush into Wikipedia, and we\u2019ll vote that the article should be the way we say it is.\u201D And so suddenly you have 100 people show up to vote in a little mini-vote or a poll that people are taking, and then we say, yeah you know what? That\u2019s not the way it works, right? Mm-hmm. At the end of the day, this is a dialogue and a discussion, and we need to stop and have a conversation about it. And yeah, it\u2019s very different from our somewhat broken democratic process. Yeah. It\u2019s so interesting. I mean, one thing \u2014 Seth Godin used this phrase when he talked about what he sees in Wikipedia, \u201CThe insane power of the well-organized crowd.\u201D Which \u2014 again, it takes the language of democracy to a slightly new 21st-century place. Well, yeah. I mean, I like that, \u201Corganized,\u201D because a lot of what people refer to as online community in various places is not organized, and it\u2019s atomistic is what I call it. So the classic kind of example is YouTube commenters because it\u2019s just random people firing off whatever thought comes to their head, often abusive and not very nice. And an organized crowd is a group of people who are working together under a set of agreed principles for a common end, and hopefully doing that with a certain modicum of kindness to each other and thoughtfulness. And that is very special and has to be nurtured. It doesn\u2019t happen automatically. You can listen again and share this conversation with Wikipedia\u2019s Jimmy Wales through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales, who co-founded Wikipedia and has helped form it as a global community as much as a business venture. It\u2019s a living organism with a mission statement to make \u201Cthe sum of all human knowledge available to every person in the world,\u201D and its core values include thoughtfulness, kindness, and mentoring. As I speak with Jimmy Wales, I\u2019m intrigued by what Wikipedia has been learning in its 15 years that has resonance for our wider public life \u2014 about the imperfect but gratifying work of navigating truth amidst difference, ongoing learning, and dynamic belonging. Say some more about how kindness gets nurtured. And I love it that you call out that word, and the spectre that\u2019s always in front of us now are the kind of cesspools comment sections, right? Mm. Which I think lack any kind of nurturing or \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s one of the issues about them. But talk about what it is that allowed you to create this ethos of a well-organized \u2014 it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s well-organized, right? It\u2019s well-organized and it\u2019s self-correcting, right? So how would you talk about what the ingredients are that has made Wikipedia such an open place? And yet, the level of discourse and even the ethos of kindness is such a contrast to a lot of other places where people comment and weigh in. Sure. Well, I mean, a piece of it is \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we can minimize this \u2014 is software design because the design of software interacts with behavior in interesting ways. So, if I go to most newspaper comment sections, as a member of the community, I can\u2019t join and gain any kind of longer-term say over how things are done. And indeed, if somebody posts an inflammatory comment there, the only thing I can really do is complain to the newspaper, which generally takes a long time. Unless it\u2019s actually abuse, they aren\u2019t going to be able to do anything about it. Or I can yell back at the person and say, \u201CShut up, you\u2019re being an idiot.\u201D And then I\u2019m accidentally joining in the nasty behavior. And so when you\u2019ve got these kind of unmoderated forums, or slowly moderated places where the community doesn\u2019t have genuine control of their environment, the software doesn\u2019t let me do anything other than yell at people. And if, as we have at Wikipedia, there\u2019s a lot of different options. So if somebody posts an inflammatory comment, because our comment pages are just Wiki pages \u2014 they\u2019re editable pages \u2014 anyone can come and delete a comment. And that happens quite often. If somebody comes and says something incredibly nasty, somebody else will just come along and just say \u2014 delete it and remark \u201Cremoving personal attack.\u201D And that\u2019s a public act itself. So again, if you\u2019re not doing the right things, people will say, \u201CHey, you\u2019re going around deleting perfectly nice comments. Why are you doing that?\u201D And that kind of openness, the transparency about the actions, but also giving real control into the community. So at most websites, the only people who can ban people are employees. So employees of the newspaper read all the comments, and if somebody\u2019s being really vile and abusive, they\u2019ll block them. Right. Well, in our case, that isn\u2019t done in the main by employees at the Wikimedia Foundation. It\u2019s done by the community, by trusted community members who\u2019ve been elected and who are held accountable for how they do it. So it\u2019s a lot of things like that that mean that, in addition to having a culture that says we want to have goodwill, we want to achieve quality work here, we also have the tools, that we have other options other than just yelling at people. And hopefully, when we\u2019re doing our job well, we do these things in good humor. So a classic kind of example of this is, it is very common for somebody who\u2019s never edited a Wikipedia before to show up and replace an entire entry with a single curse word or something like this. Just because they can\u2019t \u2014 their friend said, \u201COh, did you know you can do this?\u201D And they\u2019re like, \u201COh, no. What if I just did this? What would happen?\u201D Right. And then hopefully instead of being blocked, what ideally happens \u2014 and it\u2019s not always perfect \u2014 but somebody will say \u201Crevert your edit,\u201D and then say, \u201COh, thank you for your experiment. However, if you want to learn how to edit a Wiki, here\u2019s some Sandbox pages where you can go and practice.\u201D So, approaching people with a bit of good humor and saying, \u201COh, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t really mean to replace the entire entry with a curse word. Maybe you\u2019d like to join us and do something productive.\u201D And oftentimes, that works. Newcomers \u2014 and in fact, lots of people say to me, \u201COh, yeah, I\u2019ve been a Wikipedia editor for a year.\u201D \u201COh, how\u2019d you get started?\u201D \u201COh, well, I was a vandal.\u201D \u201CI vandalized a page, and then people were nice to me, so I decided actually that wasn\u2019t fun. So I thought I would just edit Wikipedia.\u201D Gosh, I knew this before I spoke with you, but it is really this kind of living \u2014 very living dynamic model of \u2014 it is a model of something, right? Of cultivation? Of growth? Of, like, mentoring? All these things. And it\u2019s dynamic. Mm-hmm. And the thing is, it is a genuine community. Yeah. Which with all of that means good and bad. And I think this is something that\u2019s easy to miss, because as a reader, when you read Wikipedia, of course it\u2019s written in this very authoritative, dry style, and you don\u2019t get the sense that you\u2019re interacting with a noisy and vibrant community. Until you dig in a little further, and then you go behind the scenes, and you see the people editing, and their discussions. And you go, \u201COh, actually, I get this. There\u2019s a lot of different people here and they\u2019re having discussions, and that\u2019s how it works.\u201D Mm. I was looking at Wikimedia just yesterday. It\u2019s a really interesting collection of kinds of ways that this is out there in the world, impacting physical spaces, right? And lives. The teacher whose students can write a Wikipedia entry in lieu of a mid-term exam, which as you talk, I realize what that means is not just \u2014 it\u2019s not just a writing exercise, right? Then they enter into this community of cultivation and really mentorship. Mm. Yeah, and sometimes that\u2019s a really fantastic thing. And other times it\u2019s actually been\u2026 A pain? \u2026problematic. Yeah. So if a teacher wants to do that, we really encourage them to come and speak to the community, and we can help design the program. Because otherwise, it ends in tears. I remember there was a case where a university professor assigned all the students to go out and edit Wikipedia. And we sort of had this flood of entries about the garbage can on the corner of the street at the university campus and things like that. And then they were deleted immediately and blocked. And all the students felt sad because Wikipedians hated them. But on the other hand, if it\u2019s done well, and the students are given some training and explanation of \u2014 here\u2019s the things that Wikipedians care about: they want you to use sources. They want you to be kind in your interactions. Don\u2019t get upset. Have a good debate. Then I think it\u2019s an incredibly valuable exercise. There\u2019s also one that caught my eye. It was an article by a community member on why I proofread poetry at Wikisource. And she used this language of it. \u201CPoetry is the stuff of the soul. It speaks to the body, the mind, and the spirit alike.\u201D And she had had some some hardship, and this process literally had been part of her healing. I don\u2019t know, I wonder if you would have anticipated something like that when you started this. No, I wouldn\u2019t have. And I think a lot of things like that, I hadn\u2019t thought of. I mean, if you had asked me, I wouldn\u2019t have said, \u201COh, no, that will never happen.\u201D Mm-hmm. It just didn\u2019t occur to me. Yeah. But I have seen it now many times, that people \u2014 they edit about a topic that is very personally meaningful to them, but also they edit and make new friends. And we\u2019ve got a handful of Wikibabies these days. What does that mean? People who have met through editing Wikipedia and have gotten married and have babies. Wow. So, there\u2019s a few of those out there, and that\u2019s kind of fun because that is a community. That\u2019s people who know each other. And we have \u2014 people meet up. Sometimes, like, once a month they meet up in a bar, and have a few drinks, and discuss the latest things going on in their language. And so, yeah, it\u2019s really something else to see. Yeah. And isn\u2019t it interesting? Our media project is very, very tiny compared to yours, but my colleagues who\u2019ve created the ethos in our digital space has also been able to create a, I say, a kind, generous, self-correcting \u2014 a place with an ethos. And \u2014 which a lot of people don\u2019t think is possible, right? I\u2019m sure you get this. People just don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2014 they have the worst images in mind of digital spaces, and they think that it\u2019s always going to be the lowest common denominator. Well, exactly. And this is where I think software design is so important. Because, in the main, if you go and read newspaper comments, you just weep for the future of humanity because it seems horrible. And you can really \u2014 people who work in those organizations, it can be very poisoning, because you think, \u201CRight. Well, we\u2019re here trying to write a quality newspaper, and it\u2019s like a seething mass of idiots out there.\u201D Yeah. Even though, at another level, they know that isn\u2019t true. But just the online can bring out the worst in people. But it also \u2014 there\u2019s still most people are perfectly decent. I mean, we all know this intuitively. You walk into any room anywhere, a restaurant, and you look around, and you just think basically these are all pretty nice people. And some of them will be annoying, but very rarely are people actively malicious. And yet online, you can get this sense of like, \u201CWow, this is really bad.\u201D But I also think there\u2019s kind of a paradox that happens that when it works, when these digital communities are good and kind of calling people to their better selves, then this paradoxical thing happens that the people then do actually want to get together in the flesh. So I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re charting this, but all of these digital communities are also creating physical spaces and experiences in flesh and blood in the world. Mm. Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s a great thing and I think there\u2019s great possibilities for the future if we work hard to harness these tools, and to think about design, and to think about community and culture to encourage more of this kind of thing, more helpfulness, more usefulness, move away from the kind of, I would say, purely divisive and argumentative culture, which we see too often online, but also in the media and elsewhere. And I see things \u2014 I mean, just some wonderful stories. I was in Kiev, Ukraine, during actually the worst of the conflict, and people there were very upset. Russia had just taken Crimea. And I did a little meet-up with the local Wikipedians, one of whom had been shot and killed in the protest on the Maidan. And they said to me, \u201CYeah, we\u2019re having a lot of trouble. We\u2019re half Russian language speakers, some people from Russian Wikipedia, a lot of the entries relating to the current situation. It\u2019s very tense, and very emotional and difficult for people.\u201D And I suggested, \u201CWell, why don\u2019t you \u2014 can you visit each other? Can you talk to each other?\u201D And so they did. They held a little mini-conference. And a bunch of Russian Wikipedians came down and met the Ukrainian Wikipedians. And it helped. Obviously, it didn\u2019t solve the problems completely, but for me, those are the people, those are the heroes there who are saying \u2014 and their interest, actually, is not about resolving the broader conflict. I mean, I think they do have an interest in that, but really, like, how do we write about this conflict in a way that is neutral, that is constructive, that helps people understand wherever they come down on the sides? That\u2019s the kind of thing that I think is fantastic and heroic, and the kind of thing that we need more of in the world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with internet entrepreneur and Wikipedia co-founder, Jimmy Wales. As I said, you are invoked a lot in my life conversation. And then when I really decided, when I came back into the office on Monday and said, \u201COK, we have to try to get Jimmy Wales,\u201D is when I heard you on NPR. It wasn\u2019t that long ago. And the person who was interviewing you told you that one of their producers, in preparation for the interview, had planted some falsehoods on a Wikipedia page and that it was still there at the time of this interview. And you had such a great response. Do you remember what you said? I think I said please don\u2019t do that. But you also\u2026 Behave \u2014 go and fix that. Come on. Yeah. Well, you also said\u2026 What did I say? You said something like \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was the first time that it happened, and you said you always want to hold journalists accountable. You said it would be like reporting on a neighborhood that\u2019s especially clean and orderly, and that \u2014 would you go in and create a mess? To see if they cleaned it up. Yeah, to see if they cleaned it up. Exactly. Yeah. But I do want to ask you about what you\u2019ve learned through this adventure about truth. And so, I read one musician, and I know there are a million variations on this comment, somebody saying about his biography on Wikipedia, \u201CI can say to you these are the facts, but they are not true.\u201D And I wonder, what are you learning, what questions have arisen for you about this big philosophical question, the nature of truth, how it is discerned, how we tell it? Well, I mean, I think there\u2019s a few things. So, one of the things that I think is interesting about Wikipedia is that I believe that truth is the recognition of the facts of reality. That it\u2019s an objective theory of truth and that it\u2019s really hard to get to. To do a good job of thinking, and a good job of sorting through fallacies, and sifting the evidence, and coming to truth is very hard. But it is something that human beings can do, albeit imperfectly. And what\u2019s interesting is that my view of truth actually doesn\u2019t matter. A person who edits Wikipedia who thinks truth is highly a social construct or something, we can still edit together, as long as they agree that the social contract has to do with making noises about reliable sources and evidence. So then we\u2019re OK. And then the other thing that I think is really interesting about this is that how often it is possible for people who disagree fundamentally on some important issue, if they\u2019re kind and thoughtful and they take a deep breath, can work together productively to describe that issue. So I always invite people to imagine a very kind and thoughtful Catholic priest and a very kind and thoughtful Planned Parenthood activist. And they\u2019re working together on an entry about abortion, about which clearly they\u2019re never going to agree. Yeah. But yet, they can both agree to say, let\u2019s present this fairly. So, the priest will understand Wikipedia can\u2019t say abortion is a sin, but it can say the Catholic church position on abortion is this and such. And the Pope has said this. And critics have responded that. And together, they can work together to have something that they\u2019re both proud of, where they can both point to it and say to people, \u201CIf you want to understand in a deep way the issue of abortion and where all the sides come down and what the debate is about, come and read this. We\u2019ve worked together to produce this, and we both agree that it\u2019s quite good.\u201D Like, that\u2019s possible and is easier than you would have ever thought. Certainly, if we go back to internet commenting style or head-to-head talk show style, basically, people are in sort of violent disagreement, and they yell at each other, and nothing is resolved. But actually, if you step back a notch, or as we say, go meta, go one level higher \u2014 so don\u2019t try to prove your side in the debate, just describe the debate \u2014 and do that in a fair way. It actually works. And in fact, that\u2019s really what you want from an encyclopedia. I don\u2019t want to go to an encyclopedia and hear one side of a contentious issue, even if it\u2019s the side I agree with. I want to understand very deeply what the different parties have to say. So, if I ask you this, how do you think about the relationship between facts and truth? Well, facts, meanings are what metaphysical states of affairs that exist in the world. And truth, meaning statements about those facts. And a true statement will correspond to those facts. So it\u2019s very old fashioned and straightforward. Mm-hmm. But facts alone don\u2019t necessarily create truth. No. Right? Because I think truth, in this sense, truth meaning truth or falsity as an attribute of statements of other world of propositions, is inherently cognitive. If there were no minds attending to the facts of reality, there would be no truth or no falsehood because there\u2019s no statements. And so that is complicated, isn\u2019t it? Yeah, I like that there are facts and \u2014 but then there\u2019s the work of attending to the facts. And that discernment, that willingness to observe and put together becomes \u2014 is the move towards truth. And it\u2019s a great human responsibility to think, and to really focus your mind and pay attention to the facts and understand the facts. And I think it\u2019s important to do that with passion, but not on a primary basis of emotion because emotion can certainly cloud your ability to correctly identify what\u2019s going on in the world. Mm. That\u2019s great. So it\u2019s interesting to me, on Wikimedia also there was a \u2014 I guess you have the \u201CExtraordinary Picture of the Year\u201D every year. Mm. Yes. And so this year, it was \u2014 there were 1,300 pictures that had been considered. And of course, they were all stunning photographs. It was interesting to me because I do think of Wikipedia as a community of people and very kind of people-oriented. And that\u2019s also what you\u2019ve been talking about. I noticed that all of these pictures are very transcendent in a way. They\u2019re vast expanses of space, or just buildings that are transcendent like the interior of a mosque in Shiraz, Iran. There\u2019s the old library of Trinity College, Dublin, which is almost like a cathedral of books, right? A metro station in Stockholm that looks like it\u2019s kind of built into a cave. But \u2014 a sunrise, the Milky Way. Right. The Milky Way was a picture \u2014 there\u2019s a woman, I think, and then the title is \u201CHeavens Above Her.\u201D I don\u2019t have really a question to that. I just wanted to say I found that fascinating, the kind of transcendent, vast expanse of the images that came out of this process of Wikipedia. And I wondered if it says anything to you about what it is or what happens there. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s interesting because we do these photo contests, and they\u2019re always amazing. And people submit amazing work. And I think it\u2019s quite \u2014 what I would say about it is it\u2019s quite aesthetic work. And what\u2019s interesting about that is that you might think that the Wikipedians, being very obsessed with references and facts and very, very matter of fact and so on in our style and our thinking, might miss the poetry of the universe. And yet, these are the kinds of people, very intellectual, very passionate people who really appreciate amazing art and amazing work of photography, for example. Which is wonderful. Yeah. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d hope for. I guess it also \u2014 and I may be completely projecting here \u2014 but I wonder if you\u2019ve been describing a community that aspires to the good, essentially. That honors and actually resides on virtues like kindness, and generosity, and a willingness to listen. And I felt like these images also were all very aspirational, like it\u2019s a grand vision of the larger context that we inhabit of space, and time, and our great art and architecture, and the natural world. I don\u2019t know. Mm. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, as you said in the beginning, it\u2019s quite a grand idea \u2014 a free encyclopedia for everyone. So I think maybe the kinds of people who think in that way think globally, think about if every single person on the planet could have access to knowledge are also going to be quite moved by sort of grandiose imagery. Yeah, I would globally and cosmologically, really. And cosmologically. Yes, exactly. And of course, within our community, we\u2019re a bunch of geeks, a lot of science fiction geeks, so loving an amazing photo of the Milky Way obviously makes sense. Yeah. So, one way I think about the internet and I discuss it with people is everything it is that we talk about and fret about, and get excited about \u2014\u00A0essentially, it is, on some level, merely a new canvas for the old human condition. But we\u2019re evolving on that canvas, right? It\u2019s also taking us new places. So how do you think about what it is telling us about ourselves from where you sit, and where it might be taking us? Well, I mean, for me, I think one of the mistakes that people make is assuming that somehow that cyberspace, the digital world, is somehow fundamentally different and a break from the past. And in some ways, of course it is, just in the fact that we all have a piece of glass in our pockets, a phone, where we can communicate with the world and see everything. But we\u2019re still human beings. And we\u2019re still effectively the same organisms as our predecessors 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago. And all of the kinds of problems and solutions that have evolved over those times still remain the same. And so we should think about, as a political example that we\u2019ve been involved in, is mass surveillance. And the idea being put forward that, gee, now that we have the tool of the internet, that it\u2019s somehow OK for the government to have mass surveillance of every single person, and all of their most intimate thoughts, and their details of their lives would be astonishing to people who fought so hard in the era of McCarthy, and who fought so hard for the civil liberties around privacy. Because we\u2019re still the same people. We still have the same rights that we\u2019ve always had, to be treated as non-criminals, to be respected in our personal lives and personal space. And it is a mistake to say \u201COh, well, yes. But now we have the internet. Everything\u2019s different. Terrorists can use the internet to plan crimes.\u201D Well, they could also plan crimes in the old days too, and they did. That\u2019s right. So we have to say the same kind of trade-offs that we\u2019ve had to figure out painstakingly over a very long period of time still matter today. Mm-hmm. So, here\u2019s another kind of large, well, impossibly large question, but I just wonder how you would start to think about it today. How would you start to answer the question through this frontier you walked on, this thing you helped bring into the world, what have you learned \u2014 what are you learning about what it means to be human that you didn\u2019t know before? That you\u2019re only now being able to articulate or see? Well, I think one of the things that I \u2014 it\u2019s not that I had it wrong, but that it had just never occurred to me, and now is incredibly obvious to me \u2014 is that people all over the world are in many, many, many, most fundamental ways, in the most fundamental ways, the same. And a lot of what goes on in an environment where we\u2019re concerned about terrorism, and we\u2019re concerned about clashes of cultures, can overlook that fact that I\u2019ve met ordinary Wikipedians from all around the world, and they laugh at the same kind of jokes, and they do the same kinds of things. They care about the same kinds of things. Everybody wants safety. Everybody wants security. Everybody wants to have some fun. Everybody wants to have a meaningful work to do in their lives. All of these things are the same. And that\u2019s not to say that the differences are nonexistent, or unimportant. And in fact, they are different and important. And we do have to deal with that and cope with the ways that ideology cause people to behave in ways that are violent and so forth. But we shouldn\u2019t do it by imagining that great swathes of the planet are just the other, and the unreformable, and so different from us that we can never get along because that\u2019s just not true.
