  "fullText": "Christian Wiman is a writer who has come to give voice \u2014 to his own surprise \u2014 to the hunger for faith and the challenge of faith for people now. He\u2019s the editor of Poetry magazine. His Texas upbringing was soaked in both a history of violence and a charismatic Christian culture. He wasn\u2019t formally religious for years after he left home, lived all over the world, and became a poet. Then when he was in is late 30s, he married the love of his life, found God again, and was diagnosed with an incurable, unpredictable cancer. So Christian Wiman is more aware of his mortality than most of us, and he\u2019s bearing a kind of poetic witness to something new happening in himself and in the world. I am convinced that the same God that might call me to sing of God at one time might call me at another to sing of godlessness. Sometimes when I think of all of this energy that\u2019s going on, all of these different people trying to find some way of naming and sharing their belief, I think it may be the case that God calls some people to unbelief in order that faith can take new forms. \u201CRemembering God.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from APM, American Public Media. Christian Wiman has published several volumes of poetry and prose as well, most recently, My Bright Abyss. I spoke with him in 2012. He\u2019s a prolific writer of essays that are philosophical or theologically reflective and always in their own way both honest and poetic. One called \u201CThe Limit,\u201D for example, begins with this arresting sentence: \u201CI was 15 when my best friend John shot his father in the face.\u201D But details of that shooting at which he was present and of Christian Wiman\u2019s own destructive anger as a child mingle with observations like this: \u201CIt was nearly dusk, my favorite time in west Texas. The light, like steeping tea, shadows sliding out of things.\u201D I always talk to people about this and I\u2019ve heard and read a lot of stories about the interesting ways religion and spirituality get communicated to us as children. I have to say, Christian, that your story of all of them that I\u2019ve heard all these years is the most familiar to me. Growing up absolutely immersed in this religious universe, which meant everything, right? Right. But then when I left that place \u2014 and, like you, I went far, far away \u2014 the religious piece stopped to make sense as well because it was the whole package. Yeah. I think for me it was a big loss. I didn\u2019t realize exactly how large a loss for years because I, like so many people, dispensed with it and became an agnostic or whatever you want to call it. But I wonder. You know, I\u2019ve got little kids now and I do think about what I should teach them and how I should teach them in terms of their spiritual lives because I greatly value the way I was raised, which was completely immersed in that culture. Yeah. Did you go to church like twice on Sunday and Wednesday night? Yep, yep, sometimes even more. We had to learn Bible verses and save them. And the hymns, the singing. Knew the hymns and had the singing. And there was no possibility of puncture to that world. You know, I never met anybody who didn\u2019t believe until I went off to college. Never met a soul, you know. And I value the coherence of it and I value the intensity of it and the momentum that it\u2019s given my life. But it\u2019s also created all kinds of difficulties, as I\u2019m sure you know. Yeah. I think there are a lot of people like us, though, in this country and especially, I don\u2019t know, what we call the Bible Belt. But I\u2019m not sure when you get outside the Bible Belt, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a narrative people recognize. I think that\u2019s true. I have discovered that there is an enormous number of people in this country who are \u2014 you know, they have some kind of religious language that they\u2019re just unhappy with. It doesn\u2019t accord with, you know, their feelings of the sacred or their feelings of what spirituality means and they\u2019re casting about for some way of believing. Yet you can\u2019t just jettison everything that you have, you know. I also wonder about the origins of your life as a poet. You know, in one of your essays, you start by saying when you were 20 years old, you set out to be a poet. But I guess I\u2019m curious too about, you know, where you see the inklings of that or the impulses or hungers or habits that were there earlier in your life that then somehow came to life at that point when you were 20. Well, I certainly wrote when I was a little kid. I just didn\u2019t really know that they were poems. My mother is a creative person; she would paint and she would write things herself. We weren\u2019t a family that read. There weren\u2019t books around. But I did try to emulate the hymns that I heard and I would write these little fragments of things and little songs. In fact, I think I was six or seven years old, we went to the First Baptist Church in Dallas, which, at the time, was the largest Baptist Church in the world. I don\u2019t know if it still is, but it took up four city blocks, was this massive place. The guy\u2019s name was Brother Cristobal. I forget his first name. But they published the Southern Baptist Newsletter out of there. It was just this enormous place. At the end of the service, you know, they would have what I\u2019m sure you grew up with. They would have the call for people to be saved and people would flood the aisles at this place because there were thousands of people in the congregation. So one day when I was six or seven years old, I left my family and ran down there, didn\u2019t even tell them. They thought I was going to get saved and I just handed him a poem that I had written. And the poem was, \u201CI love the Lord and the Lord loves me, I will not forget and neither will He\u201D \u2014 the whole thing. Wow. And then it turned up in the Southern Baptist Newsletter. He published it. You know, I turned around and ran back and he\u2019d published it in the Southern Baptist Newsletter. They had this little poem there, probably my biggest publication . And I would bet that you were the only editor of Poetry magazine who\u2019s ever had his first poem published in the Southern Baptist magazine. That\u2019s probably true, that\u2019s probably true, although there have been editors who are very interested in theology. Henry Rago was very interested in theology. And then, of course, on another level, somewhere you wrote that your childhood was the \u201Cvery forge and working-house of poetry.\u201D I mean, in terms of the raw materials of drama and pathos and emotion, I mean, your childhood was \u2014 there\u2019s so much violence in there, in your family. Well, my family\u2019s very chaotic, but I would not say that I\u2019d had a difficult childhood compared to a lot of people I\u2019ve seen since then because I was loved by my family. You know, a lot of people grow up without love. Your mother watched her father kill her mother. Yeah. That happened when my mother was 14, yeah. Her father came in and shot her mother, and my mother and her two brothers were sitting at the table. It\u2019s really an awful story. She turned around \u2014 my grandmother, her mother \u2014 turned around and said, \u201COh, Fred, no.\u201D She realized what had happened. She got shot in the back and the kids ran out and then her father just lay down beside his wife and shot himself. My mother moved from place to place. She was 14 years old and all those kids got separated and they all, you know, emerged out of that, but not psychologically intact. I suppose what\u2019s just striking me right now as we talk is that story gets told and it\u2019s very dramatic about that murder. But really what\u2019s astonishing about the story is, as you say, you were raised by this woman who went through that when she was 14 and she loved you and that was this defining thing that she was able to do despite that. Yeah. Well, I was raised in a very masculine culture. You know, I played football and went hunting and I got in tons of fights when I was a kid. I had that sort of masculine inclination and imperative in me and around me all the time. But when I look back at my life, it\u2019s my mother and my grandmother who really shaped me. It\u2019s feminine consciousness that I responded to and both of them \u2014 my mother is a more educated person than my grandmother and my grandmother had a kind of consciousness that really took me a long time to understand because I think many people would simply say it was unconsciousness. She lived within that religious culture that we talked about that was completely saturated and defined by, you know, Baptist theology. But she also lived in her world in a way that is unlike anyone I\u2019ve known since actually. I mean, she knew her world down to the least flower, the least creature that was in her yard and every person that was in her life. It was a kind of passive consciousness. I like to use the word passive without any pejorative meaning, but a kind of passive consciousness that seems to me in some ways exemplary, and I think poetry comes out of that. You know, you say passive, but what else I think of is embodied conscious. I mean, physical, incarnational almost. You could say that in consciousness, it all manifests itself in physical reality and is in touch with that. Yeah, I love that definition actually. I think that\u2019s a great definition of the way she was. There\u2019s a section in this book that is about her. Here we go. It says, \u201CShe who in her last days loved too well to lose a single weed to namelessness, in creosote, blue gramma, goatsbeard that is not thriving, is, amid the cattails\u2019 brittle whisper whispers, O, Law\u2019, Honey, ain\u2019t this a praiseful thing.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this On Being. Today, \u201CRemembering God\u201D with the poet Christian Wiman. He describes his own turn back to God as an ascent to a faith that remained latent in him from childhood, and he\u2019s drawn on disparate voices as he has sought to make sense of this for himself from the French philosopher and social activist Simone Weil to the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who pondered what he called \u201Creligionless Christianity\u201D from the Nazi prison in which he died. So one thing I really like in your poetry and I think it connects also to your faith is this real tie to reality, which also gets intellectualized, the notion of reality. Do you know what I mean ? I don\u2019t know. When I was reading through you, I also found a lot of reference to reality from Simone Weil, \u201CIt is necessary to have had a revelation of reality through joy in order to find reality through suffering\u201D or even in this essay you wrote, \u201CHive of Nerves.\u201D You talked about Christ using metaphors, speaking the language of reality in terms of the physical world. So tell me about how you think poetry works with reality uniquely. Well, you know, I\u2019ve been sick lately and I actually had a bone marrow transplant and was in the hospital for quite a long time. And one of the things, poetry died for me for a while. I found that it just wasn\u2019t speaking to me. I think I had certain expectations that took me a while to realize were false expectations. I think we often talk about poetry getting us beyond the world and taking us to the very edge of experience and then getting us into the ineffable. I have to say, when I was, you know, faced with the actual ineffable, I didn\u2019t want poetry that gave me more of the ineffable. What I wanted was some way of apprehending the world that was right in front of me that was slipping away. I wanted the world, you know, in front of my eyes, and the poems that I found useful were absolutely concrete, sometimes not at all about religious things and not at all about spiritual things, but simply reality, and reality rendered in such a way that you could see it again. There\u2019s a great quote from the mid-20th-century literary critic R.P. Blackmur. He\u2019s talking about John Berryman. He said that his work \u201Cadds to the stock of available reality.\u201D It added to the stock of available reality, and that\u2019s a good way to think about what a real poem can do. It suddenly makes the amount of reality that you have in your life greater. You\u2019re able to apprehend more of it. Yeah. Recently I was talking to a physicist, a string theorist, who\u2019s working with a new kind of mathematical language. And the analogy we were talking about is the difference between poetry and prose. So the fact that there are truths you simply can\u2019t convey in a factual sentence, right? And it seems possibly that there are physical realities that you can\u2019t convey with an equation, but that more visual mathematics might be able to convey. Gosh, that\u2019s interesting. I think that\u2019s why physics is so fascinating to so many of the poets. You know, to contemporary poets these days, there is some kind of reality that\u2019s being revealed that we can only reach through oblique ways. You know, I think I reached this way back. It\u2019s when I\u2019m drawn to mystics like Meister Eckhart and more contemporary ones like Simone Weil and language of apophasis, where you state something, but the statement sort of unstates itself. So that Meister Eckhart said, \u201CWe pray to God to be free of God.\u201D We ask God to be free of God. I don\u2019t think he wanted to, you know, give up his religion. The idea wouldn\u2019t have occurred to him, but he wanted to give up that idea of God as being this thing outside of our consciousness. And I think one thing poetry can do is take us to those places where reality slips a bit. You know, what we think of as reality slips a bit, like those equations in physics, and suddenly we\u2019re perceiving something differently than before. And it\u2019s not all airy-fairy mysticism either. It\u2019s quite angular and hard-edged and that\u2019s what I think the analogy is with physics and with physical science. So it\u2019s very interesting that your return to faith was very much connected to finding love. Yeah, it was. You know, I\u2019m resisting saying falling in love because we do throw it around so much and it\u2019s something you fall into and fall out of. But what you have really, really dug into, you know, love is something that puts us in touch with transcendence and with mystery. You were just really aware of that and articulate about it. Well, I mean, it was a revelatory time for me because I certainly would never have said those things in the past. I had to have the experience to be able to write about it. In fact, I would have actively denigrated the notion probably. The notion of \u2026 Oh, the notion that love could open up the world for you in that way. We just published a poem in the magazine by a poet named Spencer Reece, who\u2019s become an Anglican priest, as it happens. He\u2019s talking about the whole poem is an elegy for someone he knew and is trying to get at the truth of his life. And he says, \u201CAll I know is that the more he loved me, the more I loved the world.\u201D I think in any genuine love, and it\u2019s not simply romantic love \u2026 .Right. It\u2019s other loves, yes. It\u2019s our love for our children, yeah. It\u2019s friendships, yeah. Right. I think there\u2019s some kind of excess energy. We tend to think of love as closing out the world and we can only see the face of the beloved. You know, everything else goes quiet or goes numb. But actually what I experienced was that \u2014 and I\u2019ve experienced it again with my children \u2014 is that the love demanded to be something else. It demanded to be expressed beyond the expression of the participants. You know, it kept demanding more. That excess energy, I think, is God. And I think it\u2019s God in us trying to return to its source. I don\u2019t know how else to understand it. But if I think of myself as having returned to faith \u2014 and I do think of that, although I feel like I\u2019m a desperately confused person. When people look to me for advice or direction on faith, I just feel sometimes like it\u2019s hilarious. You know, I think we have these experiences and they are people reacting against the word spiritual these days. But I don\u2019t know what other word to use at this point. They are spiritual experiences and then religion comes after that. Religion is everything that we do with these moments of intense spirituality in our lives, whether it\u2019s whatever practice we have, whether it\u2019s going to church, whether it\u2019s how we integrate sacred text into our lives. Being religious or taking on some sort of religious elements in your life, you\u2019re not necessarily saying I agree with everything that this religion says. What you are saying is that I\u2019ve had these incredible experiences in my life of suffering or joy or both and they have demanded some action of me and demanded some continuity of me. And the only way that I know to do this is to try to find some form in it and try to share it with other people. I actually wanted to ask you about the words faith and belief. You know, you\u2019ve written \u201CFaith is not a state of mind, but an action in the world, a movement towards the world.\u201D The way I\u2019ve defined it to myself is I think of belief as having objects. Faith doesn\u2019t have objects. Faith is an orientation of your life or it\u2019s an energy of your life or however you want to define it. But I think it is objectless. Doesn\u2019t have to be faith in \u2026 Right. And that has helped me to at least understand those terms somewhat and to explain to myself why I do need some sort of structures in my life. I do need to go to church. I need specifically religious elements in my life. I find that if I just turn all of my spiritual impulses \u2014 if I let them be solitary, as I am comfortable in being, I\u2019m comfortable sitting reading books and trying to pray and meditating. Inevitably, if that energy is not focused outward, it becomes despairing. It turns in on itself and I will look up in a couple of months and I find that I\u2019m in despair. So I think that one of the ways that we know that our spiritual inclinations are valid is that they lead us out of ourselves. Your story to me is very much an example also of this phenomenon of our time where we choose these things, where we create our spiritual lives, which is really new, you know. You were given this religious world as a center of gravity in your childhood, which a lot of people were until just a decade or two ago. And then there\u2019s the image I have of you and your fianc\u00E9e standing outside this church the day you got engaged, right? That\u2019s right, and not going in. Not going in, but then eventually deciding to go in. Yeah. I think it\u2019s a perilous difficult situation for everyone to be left on their trying to choose their spiritual life . To have charge of this . Right. And I think that a lot of mid-century Protestants\u2019 theology led by Karl Barth was a reaction against this, that you can\u2019t simply trust your gut, trust your impulses, that we\u2019ve got to have some way of finding God together. For him, it was the Bible, and he was very conservative in certain ways. And I just cannot go there. I cannot follow. I don\u2019t think we can just recovery orthodoxy in that way. I really feel that a whole new language is being created and there\u2019s too many people who are struggling with this. I mean, traditional religious language is part of it and will be part of it, but a whole new thing is being created, and it\u2019s going to involve other religions. It\u2019s going to involve other practices. I don\u2019t think you can simply resist it and say, you know, I\u2019m going to just have my little corner and keep it safe and secure. I think a lot about Dietrich Bonhoeffer in prison before he died in an extreme situation of having seen the church in orthodoxy and religious language be completely co-opted by evil. Yeah. But starting to talk about what would religionless Christianity look like, but also saying that he thought that even as the language and the ideas might cease to be relevant, that the truths behind them would persist and kind of what you just said, that new language and new forms would continually be recreated to express those. Yeah. I love Bonhoeffer, and I\u2019m struck by something else he said in a letter that he was often more drawn to atheists. He felt more fellow feeling with atheists than he did with his fellow believers. And he was trying to understand that in himself. I find Bonhoeffer an incredible figure not simply because he returned to Germany when he could have had a safe life in the United States. You know, he returned and he felt like if he didn\u2019t share in the destruction of Germany, then he couldn\u2019t credibly participate in its restoration. And he also simply felt that he had a call. You know, we wait and wait and wait for the right thing to do in our lives, but he says, no, no, no. You\u2019ve got to obey, follow that impulse as hazy as it is and then your faith will come. You don\u2019t get it first. You don\u2019t get it first. So he lost his life in that. He also said at one point, you know, God has called us to be in a world without God. Yeah, right. Before God and without God, we stand with God. Some of his statements have the feeling of poetry. They seem so wonderfully suggestive. Yes, absolutely. So, when you said a minute ago, you know, we\u2019re developing a new language, I mean, to me, that spiritual clarity and in fact, let\u2019s say Bonhoeffer also was orthodox certainly. Yes, he was, very orthodox. And the spiritual clarity, orthodox clarity, and for want of a better word, we can call openness to reality, let\u2019s say. I feel like that\u2019s what we\u2019re grasping for now. So when you see it in somebody like Bonhoeffer, those things were not in contradiction. It was \u2026 There are some \u2026 And that\u2019s what you\u2019re describing in yourself. There is some combination of austerity and clarity that I think we as a whole culture are grasping toward. And the main movement of the culture is against it. All the political language, all that is just rot. But I do think there\u2019s this huge cultural grasping toward something that won\u2019t be so froufrou and slip out of our grasp and just make us think it\u2019s ridiculous, and yet also something that is open enough to engage those parts of us that we don\u2019t understand.

Coming up, Christian Wiman on the problem with beautiful language about death, and the lure of \u201Ceccentric heavens.\u201D Also more of his poetry. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this On Being. Today \u201CRemember God.\u201D I\u2019m with Christian Wiman, a poet and essayist and the editor of Poetry magazine. He was agnostic for a number of years after a Texas Baptist upbringing, though he says he was never really at ease with the word agnostic. Christian Wiman became actively religious again in his late 30s, during a period in which he fell in love with his wife and was diagnosed with a rare and mysterious form of blood cancer. We\u2019ve been talking about the hunger for faith and the challenges of faith for people now. In an essay on this subject called the \u201CHive of Nerves,\u201D which he published in The American Scholar in 2010, Christian Wiman asked this: \u201CHow does one remember God, reach for God, realize God in the midst of one\u2019s life if one is constantly being overwhelmed by that life?\u201D You\u2019ve written about God, just the word \u2014 well, not just the word, the idea. You\u2019ve written about how it\u2019s difficult for modern people and you talk about like existential anxiety, which is something that all the classic philosophers and theologians wrote about even in the 20th century, you know, Niebuhr, our essential anxiety that\u2019s at the heart of the human condition. Right. When I\u2019m reading you, I\u2019m thinking, gosh, I don\u2019t think there are lots of people now who are right in the middle of things writing about this, but actually what you helped me see is that we do talk about this all the time, but we don\u2019t talk about it in that way. We talk about how our technology is driving us crazy, how we have to create down time, how we don\u2019t have space in our lives for what matters. It\u2019s just the trappings of this existential anxiety are very different and also very new. Yeah. We\u2019ve deflected the soul into questions of the self. You know, there\u2019s a great quote from Fanny Howe. She talks about the self has replaced the soul with the fist of survival, that we\u2019ve created a kind of climate in which to survive we need to hone ourselves. So we develop and hone ourselves and we project those selves in all kinds of various ways, whether it\u2019s Facebook or whatever we\u2019re doing. We think of our lives as being successful to the extent that those selves are ratified by other people. And we\u2019ve gotten away from the notion of the soul. It can be a real shock to find somebody who\u2019s suddenly talking about those things quite openly. I am a Christian. I believe that Christ comes alive in communion between people, and sometimes I\u2019ll think all kinds of things are wrong with my life. You know, my job is messing me up, my writing is messed up, something\u2019s messed up, and then I\u2019ll have a conversation with someone about a religious topic or it\u2019s spiritually informed in some way and it\u2019s honest. And even if we don\u2019t get anywhere, even if we disagree, the air has been cleared in me and I realize that, in some ways, that I was dealing with all these things that weren\u2019t bedrock, you know. They weren\u2019t the ground of my being, and I\u2019m trying to take care of the structures on top instead of the ground of my being. And I find that often all you need is some kind of conversation with someone, even if it\u2019s just expressing pure anxiety. Right, which just names that even if it doesn\u2019t tie it up. Exactly, exactly. Just names it and shares it, and that it can stabilize you in the world. And I think that something also that modern people will identify with and the way you talk about faith is about the animating aspect of doubt in that, even in your prayers, even in the act of going to church. It\u2019s not something separate, it\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s just part of it. Doubt is so woven in with what I think of as faith that it can\u2019t be separated. I am convinced that the same God that might call me to sing of God at one time might all me at another to sing of godlessness. Sometimes when I think of all of this energy that\u2019s going on, all of this what we\u2019ve talked about, these different people trying to find some way of naming and sharing their belief, I think it may be the case that God calls some people to unbelief in order that faith can take new forms. Let\u2019s go back to the idea that you discovered love at the same time that you discovered faith. In a mature relationship, in love as in faith, the feeling isn\u2019t always there, right? That initial clarity and intensity is not a constant part of actually being vital and growing. But it\u2019s part of the health of the thing. Yeah. I hadn\u2019t thought of that, but that\u2019s helpful for me to think of it that way. Yeah, I think that\u2019s \u2026 You know, if we\u2019re grownups about this stuff, if we\u2019re grownups about faith \u2026 Then why can\u2019t we all get together and lament the fact that there\u2019s no God ? You know, I mean, the Bible\u2019s actually full of moments like that too, you know. Yes. I think that is part of any mature faith, you\u2019re right. But I, like so many people, tend to fall into despair at those moments and think, oh, my God, I don\u2019t believe in anything \u2026 Yeah. Well, we fall into those moments of despair in our love relationships as well, right ? That\u2019s right, yeah. I wonder \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of language about death in religion and in poetry, and I wonder if some of it feels \u2014 I mean, how your perspective on that has changed being, as we\u2019ve said, a person who\u2019s more conscious of his own mortality than most of us. I mean, you\u2019ve faced death as possibly something in the near term, you know, death and transcendence, death and beauty, death as a choice, death in discovering what really matters. Do you hear that kind of language differently now? I sure do. I hear that kind of carpe diem language. There\u2019s a famous line from Wallace Stevens, \u201CDeath is the mother of beauty,\u201D you know, meaning that we can never perceive our lives until we look through it through the lens of death. But if you look through the lens of death, then it\u2019s suddenly much more abundant and beautiful and sharp. I have come to think that that is just a load of crap . I think anyone who could write that line was someone for whom death was an abstraction and, you know, a kind of pleasant abstraction actually. As it is, death is an abstraction for all of us. Even if you get, as I have been, close to dying in the last year, even if you get that close, it is still an abstraction. Not as much of an abstraction, but you simply cannot imagine your own death and the mind will not do it and you can\u2019t quite do it. I think that we actually have to have the past and the future in any \u2014 if you think about it, we have no present. You know, we\u2019re always remembering. There is no actual present. It\u2019s just the way reality is. It takes that long for our brains to process the instant. We\u2019re always remembering events and we\u2019re always projecting some sort of future, and I think that\u2019s how we get meaning in our lives. But I feel more that my imagination keeps opening onto these eccentric heavens and I have to give them credit. I have to give them their due. I\u2019m much more moved \u2014 I think, if you think of someone like Wallace Stevens, he sat back and said, \u201CDeath is the mother of beauty; hence from her, shall come to fulfillment to all our dreams and our desires.\u201D It\u2019s very distant, very detached. It\u2019s a very abstract notion of how we live our lives. I\u2019m much more moved by someone like the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. I just happened to just translated a few of his poems. Let me read you this. This is the last poem that Mandelstam wrote. Now Mandelstam was hounded to death by Stalin, and one of the reasons was he wrote a famous poem that was a mockery of Stalin, which he recited to some friends. And in those days, people were so used to hearing poetry and reciting poetry that they could hear it once and keep it in their heads. Someone memorized the poem from his recitation and then took it to Stalin and his fate was sealed. So here\u2019s the last day of Mandelstam\u2019s writing life, not the last day of his life. He died in a transient camp not long after this. Picking through garbage was the last anyone saw of him. And he knew what was about to happen to him and he knew all too well and he was composing these poems right up until the end. The last day he died, he wrote two or three poems, depending on how you put these poems together. But this was one of them. \u201CAnd I was alive in the blizzard of the blossoming pear, / Myself I stood in the storm of the bird-cherry tree. / It was all leaflife and starshower unerring, self-shattering power, / And it was all aimed at me. / What is this dire delight flowering fleeing always earth? / What is being? What is truth? / Blossoms rupture and rapture the air, / All hover and hammer, / Time intensified and time intolerable, sweetness raveling rot. / It is now. It is not.\u201D Now that seems to me an incredible expression of hope and persistence. Seamus Heaney says somewhere that hope is a condition of your soul, not a response to the circumstances in which you find yourself. I\u2019m mangling that somehow. But think of Osip Mandelstam writing this knowing what he was going through and compare that with Wallace Stevens sitting back and saying death is the mother of beauty . Right . That line you said a minute ago, eccentric heavens. I also hear that there. Yeah. These strange sort of ways of surviving seem to keep occurring to me, though if you ask me do I believe in heaven, no, I don\u2019t really believe in heaven in the way that people conceive of it, yet it somehow keeps asserting itself in my imagination. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, \u201CRemembering God\u201D with the poet Christian Wiman. So, if I ask you to think about yourself in church all those years ago in west Texas, the church you grew up in, which was just given to you like the air you breathed, and then when you\u2019re in church now, what\u2019s going on that\u2019s different? How is that experience different? Well, it\u2019s utterly different. I think it\u2019s a weaker experience now. I mean, I\u2019m just too conscious. I\u2019m unable to let \u2014 I wish I were able to let myself go in ways that those people did in my childhood and still do when I go to my mother\u2019s church now. It\u2019s one of those big mega-churches. You know, I don\u2019t agree with their theology and I don\u2019t like a lot of the ways that they commercialize their services, but it is an incredibly diverse church and the people are intensely involved. They\u2019re treating it as if their whole life were at stake. The churches I go to, liberal Protestant churches, it seems pretty casual. I wish there was some credible middle ground. I wish there was some way of harnessing the intensity that I felt in my childhood in more sophisticated ways. That may be another way of describing what the new language that we talked about that a lot of people now are searching for. It\u2019s not just new language. It\u2019s new forms, right? Yeah. And I think art has a big role to play in that. You know, encompassing art. I mean, if I think of some of the most intense experiences in my life, they are artistic experiences. Not simply making art, but responding to it. I think if a church could allow those experiences to happen without necessarily putting them in place and saying they mean this in our liturgy or they represent this, you know \u2026 Right. I think we\u2019re very self-conscious, you know, when people just inject art into worship. That\u2019s the danger there. You\u2019re talking about, I think, part of the \u2026 But I\u2019ve seen it done well, yeah. I\u2019ve seen it done well where it is just \u2014 in fact, I\u2019m just coming from \u2014 I was out on Whidbey Island at a conference and the people there put on \u2014 I guess the students did. They put on a sort of makeshift service and it was made up of songs that clearly had been written by one of the people there and had just sort of been set to music on the spot and there was a poem. It was unlike any service that I\u2019d been to. They just sort of did one thing after another, which were all addressed to God, and that was the service. I found it very beautiful, very moving, sort of the perfect thing for me. In the preface to Ambition and Survival, this collection of writings, which was 2007, so it was a few years back, you wrote, \u201CI still believe that a life in poetry demands absolutely everything \u2014 including, it has turned out for me, the belief that a life in poetry demands absolutely everything.\u201D Would you tell me what you mean when you say that? Oh, no, what a paradox . It\u2019s five years ago, so maybe it\u2019s not still true. But if it, what do you mean? I\u2019m trying to wrap my mind around it. For years \u2014 there\u2019s a poem I love by a Canadian poet named Robert Bringhurst and it starts like this. \u201CThese poems, these poems, / these poems, she said, are poems / with no love in them. These are the poems of a man / who would leave his wife and child because / they made noise in his study, she said. These are the poems / of a man who would murder his mother to claim / the inheritance. These are the poems of a man / like Plato, she said, meaning something I did not / comprehend, but which nevertheless / offended me. These are the poems of a man who would rather sleep with himself than with women, she said. These are the poems of a man / with eyes like a drawknife, hands like a pickpocket\u2019s / hands woven of water and logic / and hunger with no strand of love in them. / These poems are as heartless as birdsong, as unmeant / as elm leaves, which, if they love, love only / the wide blue sky and the air and the idea / of elm leaves. Self-love is an ending, she said, / not a beginning. Love means love / of the things sung, not of the song or the singing. / These poems, she said \u2026 / You are, he said, beautiful. / That is not love, she said rightly.\u201D I didn\u2019t mean to quote that whole thing, but for years, I carried that poem like it was a kind of totem in my mind. It expressed to me so perfectly what tensions that I felt between my life as an artist and my life, and I felt that I was giving everything to poetry and you had to give everything to poetry and yet, at the same time, I felt some sort of essential energy missing from some of my poems. I had to eventually give up that notion that you could give your whole life to poetry, that poetry could be this abstract thing that you could devote your life to. I mean, I\u2019d made a god. You talk about idolatry. I\u2019d made a god out of it and I had to have that shattered in order to come to write some of the poems that are in Every Riven Thing. I had to really have that notion tested severely. I think I\u2019d like to end by having you read at least maybe one of the poems that illustrate what you just said, the place you\u2019ve come to where that paradox is less agonizing. So the title is \u201CEvery Riven Thing,\u201D and riven is kind of an Old Testament word meaning broken, sundered, torn apart. This was actually the first poem that I wrote after years of silence, all those years I mentioned. I had gone I think it was three years without having written a poem. And in the middle of all those dramatic things happening to me, this was one of them. I sat down one day and found myself writing again and this poem came to me all of a sudden. It was quite a shock to write a poem and quite a shock to write a poem especially like this one. \u201CGod goes, belonging to every riven thing he\u2019s made / sing his being simply by being / the thing it is: / stone and tree and sky, / man who sees and sings and wonders why / God goes. Belonging to every riven thing he\u2019s made, / means a storm of peace. / Think of the atoms inside the stone. / Think of the man who sits alone / trying to will himself into a stillness where / God goes belonging. To every riven thing he\u2019s made / there is given one shade / shaped exactly to the thing itself: / under the tree a darker tree; / under the man the only man to see / God goes belonging to every riven thing. He\u2019s made / the things that bring him near, / made the mind that makes him go. / A part of what man knows, / a part from what man knows, / God goes belonging to every riven thing he\u2019s made.\u201D Christian Wiman is the editor of Poetry magazine.
