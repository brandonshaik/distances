  "fullText": "You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake. But then when you sit down and eat it, you just feel that rush of joy. And in the same way, I know a lot about love. I know a lot about marriage. I know a lot about adultery and divorce. Know something about the brain. Certainly know \u2014 hopefully know something about evolution. But I\u2019m just like you and everybody else. When it hits you, you\u2019re off to the races. There\u2019s been times that I\u2019ve walked towards the phone saying, \u201CDon\u2019t call him, Helen.\u201D \u201CThis isn\u2019t a good idea, Helen.\u201D As I\u2019m punching the buttons on the phone and calling him. So, bottom line is, there\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve sort of met a man who I could have really loved, and I knew immediately, \u201CNo, no. Don\u2019t go there.\u201D Whereas I think, if you don\u2019t know how powerful love is, you might try. When in fact, it\u2019s not the right idea. Helen Fisher knows how powerful love is as a leading anthropologist/explorer on the new frontier of seeing inside our brains when love and sex happen. In her TED talks that have been viewed by millions of people, and the research she does for Match.com, she wields science as a sobering, if entertaining, lens on what feel like the most meaningful encounters of our lives. In this wonderfully personal conversation, Helen Fisher reveals how we can take this knowledge as a form of power for giving conscious new meaning to the thrilling and sometimes treacherous human realms of love and sex. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Helen Fisher is a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and she\u2019s chief scientific advisor to the internet dating site Match.com. We spoke in Camden, Maine around the edges of the 2014 PopTech conference there. I always ask whoever I\u2019m speaking with if there was a religious or spiritual background to their childhood, like, however you might define that. None. None. Really? I had no religious education at all. I grew up in an entirely lily-white Christian community in Connecticut. And when it came time for Sunday School, my father said to me and to my twin sister, \u201CI\u2019d be happy to take you to the church on my way to play tennis, but you\u2019re going to have to find your own ride home.\u201D OK. And so I went once and got a ride home with Margot Evermann\u2019s family, who lived nearby. And that was it. The rest of my Sundays were spent playing with my twin sister, and I never went again. I\u2019m actually going to a church right now up in Harlem. And I originally went for the gospel music, but this particular preacher actually says something. I like to have an experience in which I come home thinking about something. This is one of the reasons that I love the theater, particularly people like Ibsen, because you come away from it with ideas, ideas about yourself, ideas about the world. I happen to be an atheist, and I always have been. I mean, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever looked at the Hubble Telescope site on the internet, but when you take a look at what\u2019s out there, it\u2019s so staggering. Reality is so staggering. The real meanings of life for me are in reality, I guess. Yeah, well, that\u2019s one of those \u2014 you talk a lot in your work about how we are kind of reversing 10,000 years of habit, and I think, I mean, we\u2019re doing that in many spheres. And I think religion is not going to look the same in the next century as it did in the 20th century. That\u2019s a wonderful way \u2014 I had not thought about that. That\u2019s wonderful. So where do you trace, really the \u2014 I\u2019m just curious \u2014 can you trace the earliest origins of this, of love, and romance, and this drive in us as something that you had this special curiosity about that you started to pursue? You know, people have always asked me why I study love. And \u2014 this is in hindsight \u2014 I\u2019m an identical twin. And long before I knew that there was a nature/nurture controversy, I was very busy trying to measure how much of my own behavior was biological and how much of it was cultural. And as a child, I was very interested in people. I lived in this glass house, and my neighbors lived in a glass house. And by the time I was 6 and 7, I would sneak into the woods and sit on an old stone wall and watch them eat dinner. And I\u2019ve always been interested in why we\u2019re all alike as opposed to why we\u2019re all different. So when it came time for my PhD dissertation, what I was most interested in \u2014 I figured that if there was any part of us at all that we had all in common, it would be our reproductive strategies. It would be our sex lives, our romantic lives, and our reproductive lives. So when I was reading about your research and what you\u2019re learning \u2014 as somebody who has been married and divorced \u2014 but also, I think so many of us who are single, but not just single people, kind of look around the world today at the matter of love, and it feels like there\u2019s just a lot of disarray. Now, whether there\u2019s more disarray than there ever has been, who knows? You know, maybe we know all the stories too much. I think it is a time of disarray. I mean, obviously, marriage and divorce has been in flux. One of the things that was interesting to me about your science is you do describe what happens in the brain as \u2014 has hallmarks of temporary insanity, right? I mean, it\u2019s obsessiveness. I mean, I think you\u2019ve said that the chief hallmark is that obsessiveness. And I just \u2014 I pulled out this passage from a novel. And I know you also like to work with literature and poetry. I do. Julian Fellowes, who created Downton Abbey \u2014 but he wrote this novel, and I just loved this passage when I found it. He said, \u201CLust, that state commonly known as \u2018being in love,\u2019 is a kind of madness. It is a distortion of reality so remarkable that it should, by rights, enable most of us to understand the other forms of lunacy with the sympathy of fellow-sufferers.\u201D \u201CAnd yet, as we all know, it is a madness that, however ferocious, seldom, if ever, lasts\u2026 But, paradoxically, mad and suffering as one is, and the heat of the flame, few of us are glad as we feel that passion slip away.\u201D You know, he goes on. What a beautiful \u2014 what a beautiful\u2026 It goes on. \u201CNo, while most people have been at their unhappiest when in love, it is nevertheless the state the human being yearns for above all.\u201D Yeah. In fact, parts of the brain associated with decision-making begin to shut down when you\u2019re in love. Literally\u2026 OK. And that makes so much sense. Yeah. The blood rolls out instead of rolling in. And so they begin to \u2014 begins to shut down. And of course, I mean, for obvious reasons. This brain system of romantic love \u2014 and I do think it\u2019s different from lust. I do think they\u2019re very different brain systems. But romantic love evolved for that reason, to enable you to overlook everything in order to be with this human being. And of course, that\u2019s what you really need to do to start that mating process. Because bottom line is that if you have four children, and I have no children, you live on, and I die out. The game of love matters. It matters big time. It enables you to send your DNA on into tomorrow. And so we\u2019ve evolved a brain system and attachments. A very strong brain system too. But it\u2019s not the same quite insanity. Maybe a different form of insanity, but it evolved to be so strong that some people will leave their community. They\u2019ll leave their town. They\u2019ll leave their family. They\u2019ll go to a different country. They\u2019ll learn a new language. They will start all over with their lives to do this thing. And then you wake up a few years later and \u2014 people wonder why love \u2014 why that early state of intense romantic passion begins to die. And bottom line is it takes a lot of metabolic energy. You don\u2019t eat. You don\u2019t sleep. You don\u2019t think about anything else. You focus on this person constantly. You change your hair. You change your life. You change your clothes. You change your friends. You do a million different things in order to win and be part of this relationship. And you can\u2019t tolerate that forever. Not only will you run out of energy, but you can\u2019t really have a child sitting there at dinner and the two of you racing around the dinner table after each other. Right. So that\u2019s what, I think \u2014 and you have described all of this and what\u2019s happening in the brain in terms of this brew of neurotransmitters and hormones. \u201CBrew\u201D is a wonderful word. Never heard that. So interesting. And yet, it\u2019s a whole different set of qualities that we need to have \u2014 that we need to be manifesting personally. And also in that relationship in order to actually be good parents, right? That\u2019s exactly \u2014 and that\u2019s one of the reasons I say to people, \u201CDon\u2019t marry him or her until some of that intensity has worn off.\u201D Really? You do say that. So that you really know more about who you\u2019re going to have a partnership with. It\u2019s very interesting because I now study personality, and I read an article not long ago about the fact that you really actually don\u2019t get to know somebody very well until about 18 months are over. And of course, if it\u2019s in a good relationship, you keep learning things about them 30 years later. I mean, when their parents die, if a child dies, if you suddenly have to move, or you lose all your money, or you make a lot of money, you\u2019re going to learn a whole lot of new things about somebody. I think that\u2019s one of the problems with American marriage. We somehow think that the minute you marry, you sort of lock the door and stay in place. Whereas relationships evolve, and a good one is constantly evolving. Was it Margaret Mead who said everyone should have three marriages even if it\u2019s to the same person? Oh, how wonderful. Yeah. Like, that everybody should have three marriages. And even if it\u2019s the same person, that the marriage has to become something new at a different stage in life. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful. I know that she said that the first one is for sex, the second one is for children, and the third one is for companionship. Yeah. But I mean \u2014 so what\u2019s so interesting again about the way you\u2019re able to break this down is this first part of it, this falling in love part of it, this passion, this madness, which then leads to this commitment, is just instinctive. It\u2019s not only built into us, it almost takes us over. No question about it. It takes over the brain. Right. Takes over the brain. But then, this other part, the part about raising children, the part about crafting a long-term love, moving into those next two marriages if you want to use that analogy \u2014 we\u2019re so unprepared for. Well, this is why \u2014 when you said we were in a time of disorganization, and we are. I mean, we are shedding 10,000 years of our farming background and all of the concepts that arose with that. I mean, the fact that a woman\u2019s place is in the home. Women don\u2019t have a head for business. Men should be the head of the family. Men should be the sole family provider. \u2018Til death do us part. All of that is vanishing before our very eyes, 10,000 years of these concepts. And so we\u2019re at this time of disorganization where nobody knows really how to go forward. Yeah. And so \u2014 but it gives us great opportunities to build the kinds of partnerships that we really want. And one of the beautiful things about what you just said is that, OK, well, we don\u2019t really know how to parent. And we don\u2019t really know much about this person. And so what we\u2019re doing now is getting into relationships very slowly. And that\u2019s the beauty of this. And that\u2019s a shift that you\u2019re seeing now demographically. Yeah. These one-night-stands, the friends with benefits, the living together before you getting married. More and more people are having children before they marry. And so, they are beginning to \u2014 they\u2019re beginning to really understand a human being before they sink the boat into a mutual thing. And I think it\u2019s important to dwell on that. Because what you are saying is that, especially generationally, you can \u2014 and I have children who are 16 and 20, right? And you can say\u2026 Boys? Girls? A boy \u2014 16-year-old boy, 20-year-old girl. Actually, she just turned 21. And you can worry \u2014 but parents can worry about the, as you say, the casual sex, the friends with benefits, which feels just really suspect and irresponsible and scary. But you\u2019re saying that that\u2019s not necessarily about them being flaky or casual. But it\u2019s a manifestation of being cautious and\u2026 Not only being \u2014 yeah, being cautious, really learning something about this person. Now, I mean, most people know all about contraception, so that worry is no \u2014 should no longer be with us. And, most people know about disease, and so that \u2014 they should be able to monitor that. And so, some of the riskiest parts of living with somebody are gone. And, of course, parents are now accepting their children living with somebody, so they don\u2019t even have the social stigma of it. And their social circles are accepting it. So, a lot of people almost intuitively reason, \u201CI\u2019ve got no reason to not do this. And I got huge reasons to really get to know this person.\u201D Well, and especially when so many people now are growing up in homes where there was \u2014 where marriages didn\u2019t \u2014 they failed. Exactly. They\u2019ve seen it around them. And not just them, but all their friend groups. I mean, I think of my kids. And then there\u2019s this interesting thing that\u2019s happening now with the fluidity of family, of all the forms of family. I mean, there is no model. Right. We\u2019re seeing a new form called \u2014 that I call the association. And, I\u2019m really excited about it because it\u2019s groups of friends. I live in New York. My \u2014 both parents are deceased. My older sister lives in Europe. My brother\u2019s dead. And my older \u2014 my twin sister lives in Europe. So, I really \u2014 Thanksgiving is a challenge for me. Mm-hmm. And I\u2019m between men, so that\u2019s a real challenge. So I have a group of friends who I see, and I see them regularly. And they\u2019re the ones that will come to the hospital if I\u2019m sick. They\u2019re the ones that I will call to say that I made a speech that people liked. And it\u2019s an association of friends that is my real family. And it\u2019s interesting how a lot of young people \u2014 they\u2019re much closer to their association than they are to their own family. So Christmas and holidays become very stressful for them. Because they go home to families that they really don\u2019t know very well, and who don\u2019t really know them. They don\u2019t know these people they way they know the people they hang around with in New York City. So we\u2019re building new forms of family. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with anthropologist of love and sex, Helen Fisher. I wonder if you\u2019ve also paid any attention to something I\u2019m aware of as a parent of teenaged children, and I hear a lot of people talking about it, is that even this romance piece seems to happen collectively in groups. Dating is not what it used to be. You don\u2019t invite the girl to go to a movie and dinner. You go out with a group of friends and then somehow people are coupled. But it\u2019s a very different pattern. And even that, I think, is cautious. I mean, first of all, they don\u2019t have a lot of money. And dinner these days costs a lot. And once you start having dinner with somebody, you are expressing a genuine interest. But if you casually go out with a group, and you go dancing, and then you all end up having breakfast at 2 a.m. at some place. And you can get to know somebody. It\u2019s the expanding pre-commitment stage. And there is, I think, a Darwinian wisdom to that. It\u2019s interesting. I was talking to somebody recently who said that actually the dinner date is coming back. But I haven\u2019t seen the signs of that. No. Even among older people. I mean, I\u2019m older. And I\u2019m forming new friendships in a group. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening to me. There\u2019s a couple men in that group that I could be interested in, but nobody\u2019s expressed anything. Everybody just goes with the group. And you don\u2019t know what the rules of the game are, \u2018cause it\u2019s a new game, right? It\u2019s a new game. Everybody has to make up their own rules, which is both extremely difficult, but has great opportunity. Yeah. I mean, for example, with technology. I mean, that is changing courtship. It\u2019s not changing love. I mean, once you \u2014 whether you meet them on Tinder or Facebook or Match.com or your girlfriend sets you up, when you meet that person in the bar or at the coffee house, your ancient human brain clicks into action. And you court the way we\u2019ve done it for millions of years. But bottom line is that courtship, how you meet somebody, what the etiquette is \u2014 we\u2019re now building what Margaret Mead called taboos. Instead of rules, taboos. One of the new taboos is that 60 percent of people on a date find it extremely rude if their partner \u2014 dating partner pulls out\u2026 Their phone? Yeah. And does a text message or uses their phone in any way. So I do this annual study with Match.com called \u201CSingles in America.\u201D And we don\u2019t poll the Match population, we poll the American population. It\u2019s based on the U.S. census. And 45 percent of women research a date before they go out. About 33 percent of men do. Far fewer men. We don\u2019t know why. Really. But my hypothesis is that men are much more afraid of being accused of stalking. And so, they\u2019re not going to do that. But what amazes me as an anthropologist is why doesn\u2019t 100 percent of both men and women research the date? Because it\u2019s natural. I mean, for millions of years, we lived in these little hunting and gathering groups. And they would arrive at a water hole, and some girl would see some cute boy at the other side of the water hole. And she didn\u2019t know him. She\u2019d ask someone about him? Yeah. Her mother knew his aunt. Her father knew his brother. She knew what he was going to be when he grew up. She probably knew what his religion was. She probably even knew whether he was a good shot or if he had a good sense of humor. People for millions of years went into relationships, even on the first date, knowing a good deal about a human being. And we somehow think that\u2019s it\u2019s natural to walk into a bar and know nothing about somebody, and unnatural to go onto a dating site. Where in fact, it really is the reverse. And now we\u2019re sort of on our own. In the past, our parents\u2026 Right. We don\u2019t have those extended circles of people who know them. We don\u2019t have any of those extended \u2014 and we are missing something. The loss of local community. Everybody\u2019s very upset about divorce. Divorce has been around for a good four million years. Serial pair-bonding is probably basic to the human animal. Series of partnerships. But what is really unusual for me is the loss of local community. We have extended communities. We have our internet friends. We\u2019ve got our work friends. We\u2019ve got our people who we exercise with. We\u2019ve got people who we go to a poetry conference with. Whatever it is, but we don\u2019t have local community. Well, and the other thing I\u2019ve thought about some over the years is how marriages are such lonely \u2014 the nuclear family is very unnatural in human history for these same reasons, right? That marriages and families would have been embedded in networks of other marriages and other families and elders and cross-generational. So well said. So well said. And I think it\u2019s like this death blow to marriage as an institution almost to have it be this isolated where you have two people who are left to take everything out on themselves. People are so upset about this \u2014 a single mother, or a single father. I\u2019m upset, like you are, about the two of them. They\u2019re all by themselves. Yes. And it\u2019s so interesting. I have a housekeeper who comes every two weeks, and I just adore this woman. And she\u2019s from Ecuador. And I asked her how many people she has for Thanksgiving. She has 50 people for Thanksgiving. I couldn\u2019t scare up 10 relatives. I couldn\u2019t do it. Yeah. But there\u2019s something beautiful about \u2014 and that\u2019s of course the way we lived for millions of years. So 100,000 years ago, if you divorced, OK, so he walked out of the little camp with his bow and arrow. And that was it. Right. But you still had your mother, your aunts, your uncles, your cousins. Yeah. A whole pile of people to support your child\u2026 Yeah. Right. \u2026with you. Right. Right. You had a whole local community. Right. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really disappearing. And that is a real shame. And so, it\u2019s part of this age of tremendous transition. So one of the things I feel comes through in your TED talks and in this presentation I saw you give yesterday is that this drive in us to mate and settle down is just one of the most fundamental things about who we are. I mean, but when you talk about these new associations, whatever stage of life we\u2019re at \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if this is a true statement \u2014 but I think most of us, at any given time, if we had a choice, \u201CWould you have a romantic sexual relationship or not?\u201D You\u2019d say, \u201CSure.\u201D But it\u2019s also possible not to be loneley without that and to have very rich lives that are full of love. Absolutely. Not that particular form of love, but full of love, which doesn\u2019t have insanity attached, which can be kind of a relief. Exactly. And you don\u2019t have to be annoyed if they leave their socks on the floor one more time. I mean, you know\u2026 So, I mean, do you think this is also, I mean, is this kind of a form of progress that we\u2019re charting, this new way of choosing our lives of love and association. I like the \u2014 it\u2019s a wonderful idea. The only thing I would disagree with is I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s new. Maybe the association part is new because it was always family. And in that kind of \u2014 there\u2019s some beauty in those \u2014 that opportunity for choice. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. We\u2019re moving back into a world where people can make choices. And I would guess in hunting and gathering societies, there are older women who say, \u201CNo. I\u2019m not going for another old man. I\u2019m going to hang around with the group and have a good time with my girlfriends.\u201D Right. And we\u2019re back at that. Whereas on the farm, they often married the next day after a partner died. Because they needed somebody to milk the cows. It\u2019s so interesting to have that big, broad lens, that perspective. Right. Well, I remember even learning that 100 years ago, or up until the early \u2014 late 19th, early 20th century, was it something like, the average marriage lasted for seven years because life spans were so different. Isn\u2019t that right? We could all hang on for seven years. Right? Almost. No matter the marriage. Right. That\u2019s interesting that you know that. I mean, very few people know that. The lifespan, by the way, has never changed. But the bottom line is, so many people died in infancy and childhood\u2026 And childbirth, yes. \u2026that the average was reduced. But in the year 1900, the average marriage, I think, was 12 years. 12. Yeah. And the \u2014 in the year 1990, the average marriage was also 12 years. But 100 years ago, the marriage ended because somebody died. And these days, it ends because somebody divorces. So I\u2019m becoming aware as we\u2019re speaking very, kind of, transactionally and biologically about the institution of marriage. And the damage that gets done to children when marriages fail the way they fail these days is significant. And those are the kinds of things that religious people talk about in sacred terms. I mean, it is thinking about marriage as an institution that is there to be nurturing, and in particular to be nurturing to the children. And, I mean, there\u2019s all this \u2014 like, the religious view of marriage as a sacrament is \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really figure in the way you study marriage and look at marriage. And I just \u2014 I wonder if you ever have conversations with religious people. It would be very interesting. But have you not \u2014 do people ever\u2026 They haven\u2019t yet, but maybe you\u2019ll inspire them. Yeah, I mean, do you see that as just a \u2014 as a way of thinking about marriage that is just completely removed from what you see and work with, or\u2026 No, I see it as a beautiful\u2026 What would an interesting discussion be for you? Well, just backing up, hold that thought because that\u2019s something I really have to think about, what an interesting discussion would be. But I think you\u2019ve started it right now. And I don\u2019t see it as religion supporting marriage. I see the profoundly basic human drive to love and form marriages as so important that we\u2019ve created institutions like religion to support it. So, even more important than religion are these profoundly basic human drives to love. And religions then build on that drive to support that drive. But it\u2019s one of mankind\u2019s institutions that is very supportive of love. So, what kind of conversation would I like to have with a theologian? Can you tell me? Well, I think maybe someone would say that they \u2014 this capacity that we have, I mean, not just restricted to romantic love, but including that, is just one of the most ennobling and defining characteristics of what it means to be human at its best. And I think\u2026 And I would agree, of course. Right. And I think they might be disturbed at your \u2014 that the scientific focus that you bring to it \u2014 that it might feel reductionistic \u2014 what happens in terms of neurotransmitters and hormones and biology. And, I mean, I wonder how you would\u2026 Great. \u2026engage that discomfort? You\u2019ve just enabled me to say what \u2014 if I\u2019d \u2014 when I die, what I\u2019m going to say next is, for me, the one thing I would like humanity to remember. And that is, the more we know about the brain, the body, human evolution, about biology, the more we will come to understand the power of culture to change that biology. Biology and culture and religion, they all go hand-in-hand. They\u2019re all parts of a huge, big system called humanity. And I don\u2019t feel that they threaten each other. I feel that they enhance one another. And that a truly religious person, if they have any imagination, can benefit from understanding that the love of God is in all of us in some form. That it\u2019s biologically based. It\u2019s not going away. And that it\u2019s part of humanity. So, I don\u2019t see a big dichotomy that other people might see. I see a tremendous union between the intellectual, the spiritual, and the biological. I think they work together as a team. You can listen again and share this conversation with Helen Fisher through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in a wide-ranging, personal conversation with the anthropologist/explorer of the science of love, sex, and marriage, Helen Fisher. She\u2019s well known for her TED talks and her research for Match.com, where she\u2019s chief science advisor. When we fall in love, it turns out, it\u2019s dopamine that makes us feel obsessed with the object of our desire, while chemicals released during sex activate a profound sense of bonding. Another thing from your science that I was applying to that is you talked about how casual sex doesn\u2019t really remain casual. It\u2019s not casual. Unless you\u2019re so drunk you can\u2019t remember. And why? And why? I mean, how you can explain it, it\u2019s because of what is set off in your brain and your body conspires to make you start feeling attached to this person. Or in love, or both. Or in love. Yeah. Right. And, when you have orgasm, you get a real flood of oxytocin and vasopressin. And these are the basic bodily and brain systems for attachment. Right. It\u2019s like what mother\u2019s get when they love their babies. It\u2019s a primal\u2026 Yeah, yeah. I mean, don\u2019t have sex with somebody you don\u2019t want to feel something for. I mean, people can do what they want to do. I\u2019m not in the \u201Cshould\u201D business. But the bottom line is, if you don\u2019t want to get attached to somebody, it\u2019s easier to not sleep with them. Right. Because you might end up being attached to somebody who really does not fit into your life. And I think as \u2014 again, in this new world \u2014 I mean, I grew up in a very conservative, strict, Southern Baptist \u2014 you know, small town where you were saving yourself for marriage, like, and this was just an absolute. And now I kind of look back on that and see it as helpful in a way. Like it provided boundaries that were good so that you didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I actually see these rules at a point. Right. Human animal needs boundaries. And here we are in a society now where we don\u2019t have any rules. Nobody knows what to do. Right. And even in very religious cultures like that, where people are kind of crafting their path towards marriage with these religious rules, I still think all the messages that are coming at them about who you marry, and about the romance of that are coming from movies with happy endings, and all the love songs that we just \u2014 that we\u2019re awash in at that age. I remember\u2026 And I wanted to ask you about that because I guess one of my kind of deeper concerns here with this subject is that somehow \u2014 I love your idea that this knowledge is power. And somehow our brains take us through these several, very powerful stages to getting to the point of being with other people. But somehow we need to figure out how to be intelligent and caring in this matter of long-term love and it seems like we have almost \u2014 it seems like our brains don\u2019t do that for us. It\u2019s such a good point because Americans love romantic love. We just love romantic love. But we don\u2019t pay much attention to attachment. And it\u2019s very interesting, I was on some radio with a guy from China. It was a great learning moment for me because I was talking about romantic love and how you can remain in love long-term as well as loving the person. And you can sustain this long-term romantic love in a deep attachment. And he said, \u201CWhy would you want to do that?\u201D Right. Because they admire attachment. Or at least he did. And he was representing the Chinese perspective that, OK, romantic love comes, and romantic love goes. What\u2019s really powerfully important is that feeling of deep attachment to a human being. And at that moment, I said, \u201COh, right, Helen. You\u2019ve just been a member of your own culture, and you\u2019ve not realized that other cultures historically\u2026\u201D The attachment itself is a wonderful thing. That\u2019s what he was telling me. And we celebrate romantic love, and we do not really celebrate attachment. And in fact, I remember a line from a poem that a friend of mine wrote, which was, \u201CWe are lied to by our love songs.\u201D Yes. Because they always end up with a happy ending. But what is it about Americans that \u2014 we\u2019ve been lied to by our love songs. We want to believe it. We do see it in the movies \u2014 rejection. But we have rose-colored glasses on. Yeah. And I just also feel like with all this change that we\u2019ve talked about, with new up-and-coming generations, it being a complete matter of choice for them, right? And then the fact that we\u2019re all living longer. Right. I mean, we have so many decades, potentially\u2026 Yeah, to live with somebody. \u2026to have \u2014 to be married, to have all kinds of relationships. Or to have a marriage that, as Margaret Mead said, might evolve to be a few marriages to survive. I just feel like somehow, we have to grab hold of this and kind of become learners. I think the young are. You do? I mean \u2014 yeah. In the \u201CSingles in America\u201D \u2014 not everybody. But in the \u201CSingles in America\u201D study that I do with Match.com, we ask them, \u201CWhat must you have in a relationship?\u201D And, \u201CWhat\u2019s very important?\u201D And they must have somebody they can trust and confide in. They must have somebody who respects them. They must have somebody who makes them laugh, which actually is very important biologically. I just love that. I love it. Yeah. Because laughter drives up the dopamine system. It\u2019s very good for you. Laughter\u2019s very good for you. Yeah. Yeah. They must have somebody who spends enough time \u2014 puts \u2014 gives them enough time. And they must have somebody that they find physically attractive. We are turning inwards. We are trying to build now the most important relationship. And when I ask the questions, like, they\u2019re very in favor of marriage without children. They\u2019re very in favor of children without marriage. They\u2019re very in favor of living together. What they will not tolerate is commuter marriages, people living in separate homes, people living in separate bedrooms. They want total transparency in the relationship. They want to be \u2014 have access to the person\u2019s cell phone. A great many of them would walk out even on a date who hides what they\u2019re saying on their phone or their texts. I think they\u2019re looking for a really special kind of relationship. 100 years ago, sure, you had a nice husband and that was great. But you also had very profound relationships with all your other people in the local community. And so, the partnership didn\u2019t have the same profound intimacy because it wasn\u2019t all you\u2019ve got. Now your partner\u2019s really all you got. And so we want everything in that partnership. That\u2019s deadly. So rather than being less serious about that primary relationship, I think we are profoundly more serious about it. I think people are taking this very seriously. There\u2019s never been so many self-help books. There\u2019s never been so many therapies, therapists, and couple\u2019s therapists, and all kinds of support systems. So this education is maybe just \u2014 it\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s happening in real time. They don\u2019t want to fail. They\u2019ve seen their parents fail. They\u2019ve seen their friends fail. They\u2019re scared of divorce. 67% of singles these days are terrified of the economic and the social and personal fallout from divorce. And we may see a real swing towards really good marriages. Well, you know, I did this study of married people. I asked these married people \u2014 it was 1,000 people in the study, a little over 1,000 \u2014 \u201CWould you remarry the person that you are married to now?\u201D And 81% said yes. So, and 76% said that they were still madly in love with this person. And I have friends who\u2019ve done other similar studies and found the same data. So, you\u2019re talking to an optimist. That\u2019s probably your problem. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with anthropologist of love and sex, Helen Fisher. Did I read that you were married once but briefly? Is that right? I was only married for a few months when I was 23. And, yeah. I married the wrong person. And actually the night we decided to divorce was one of our best nights together. And then, well, you know, I was a young hippie in graduate school. It was the \u201860s. OK. And I have then made two very long, powerful, deeply meaningful, and successful relationships. I didn\u2019t marry them, but there was true love. Mm-hmm. So how do you think all of these things you know through your science, through your work, how does it \u2014 how have you been able to work with that? Or have you? I mean, is there a limit to when we talk about the insanity part of the reality of love? I use the \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a metaphor or not \u2014 of a piece of chocolate cake. You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake. But then when you sit down and eat it, you just feel that rush of joy. And in the same way, I know a lot about love. I know a lot about marriage. I know a lot about adultery and divorce. Know something about the brain. I certainly know \u2014 hopefully know something about evolution. But when it hits you, you\u2019re off to the races. There\u2019s been times that I\u2019ve walked towards the phone saying, \u201CDon\u2019t call him, Helen.\u201D \u201CThis isn\u2019t a good idea, Helen. Take control, Helen.\u201D As I\u2019m punching the buttons on the phone and calling him. So, bottom line is, it has helped me, though. There\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve sort of met a man who I could have really loved and almost immediately found out that they loved somebody else. And, I knew immediately, no, no. Don\u2019t go there. Whereas I think if you don\u2019t know how powerful love is, you might try. When in fact, it\u2019s not the right idea. So, knowing what I\u2019ve known has helped me navigate. But the bottom line is, I\u2019m just like everybody else. Do you have any theories about, or any perspective on \u2014 it seems like the world right now, the world a lot of us inhabit, Western, urban, educated people, is full of amazing single women. And men \u2014 fewer are men who are single. And even fewer men who are as amazing or as appropriate. It feels like the world is out of balance, I think. And again, I may be talking about a certain demographic group. But it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s just 40, 50, and 60-year-olds. It seems like it\u2019s harder for 25-year-olds to know where to look for a mate. So, what perspective do you have on that? Well, first of all, I wrote a book about the natural talents of women and how they\u2019re changing the world. But I am also a big proponent of men. And I would say there\u2019s just as many amazing men out there as there are women in every age group. I don\u2019t think we understand men at all. We\u2019ve spent 50 years trying to bust a lot of myths about women. About women, right. And we\u2019ve spent no years at all busting the myths about men. But I have a lot of data with this Match.com \u201CSingles in America\u201D study that \u2014 and other data, too \u2014 but, that men are just as romantic as women are. I love \u2014 there\u2019s an old quote. It comes from a poem. It\u2019s borrowed from a poem by Ted Hughes. And I\u2019ve doctored it a bit, but it\u2019s: \u201CMen and women are like two feet. They need each other to get ahead.\u201D And we are built to work together, play together, love together, live together. And I meet an awful lot of single men in New York City. And they have brains, and they have feelings. They do love, and they want to be loved. Men fall in love faster than women do because they\u2019re so visual. They want more public displays of affection. They want to introduce a new partner to friends and family sooner. They want to move in sooner. And when you take a look at the brain \u2014 and I\u2019ve put a lot of men into a brain scanner, as I put a lot of women \u2014 it lights up exactly the same way when they\u2019re in love. And that deep sense of attachment. I remember, I was recently with a group of women from the major women\u2019s magazines. We were having a business lunch. And there were three women who couldn\u2019t find a man. They were all really good looking, young, smart, educated, going-somewhere women. And none of them could find a man. I said, \u201CYou know what? You said there\u2019s no men around.\u201D I said, \u201CI bet all three of you have at least one man in your life right now who would marry you within a week. You\u2019re picky.\u201D Yeah. And the bottom line is, we\u2019re picky for a reason. We are the ones that are going to carry that baby for nine months. We\u2019re the ones that are going to go through the danger of delivering that child. We are the ones who are going to raise that child. Largely, I mean, the real day-to-day work for the first four years, anyway, in every culture in the world. Now, men are changing diapers these days. No question about it. But still, they don\u2019t do it the way women do. Women have to be picky. But I think we\u2019re going to come to learn that men are just as romantic as women and that women are just as sexual. And that we\u2019re going to cast away these beliefs that men are just fools. That\u2019s really great. This has just been so \u2014 I haven\u2019t even looked at my notes. Oh, maybe just one last thing. And this is me being \u2014 using this as kind of a therapy. Oh, wonderful. For myself. I\u2019m not a therapist, but I\u2019ll do what I can. Well, just maybe two more questions. So, I\u2019m in my 50s now. OK. I\u2019m in my 60s. In your 60s. Yeah. And, I mean, being in your 50s and 60s is just so interesting. And in a way that\u2026 It\u2019s so interesting. Oh, I mean it\u2019s great. It is great. It\u2019s a little awkward, though, on this. It\u2019s uncertain. I mean, the trajectory of all of this is different. But one thing that I\u2019m aware of myself is I feel like one of the things that comes with \u2014 has come with age for me is I look back at my younger self and my love relationships. And I was so \u2014 I realize how much of it was about wanting to be loved, and how much of the exhilaration was about being loved. And I want to be more intentional moving forward about, like, the adventure of loving. Mm. I had an adventure recently that was very interesting. I fell immediately for a person in my business world. I would never touch that guy. He was very important in my business world. He\u2019s a happily married guy. And there was no way that Helen Fisher was ever going to put a move on him. Never. And I never did. And for the first time in my life, I would \u2014 every time I saw him, my heart would pound, or I\u2019d get a dry mouth. I would try to be a normal person. And I realized that I was going to have to enjoy this feeling all by myself. And I would come home and I would lie down and say, \u201COK, Helen. Just enjoy the feeling of\u2026\u201D He doesn\u2019t know. He never knew. And try to just enjoy the sensation of adoring somebody from the backwoods, from the back pew in the church. And it was a different experience for me to not make any kind of move. Because young girls do that. You know, they say, \u201CAh.\u201D Or you\u2019d think that it meant nothing if you couldn\u2019t make the move. Exactly. So, but I do think that what goes around comes around. And if you and I and other people just spend some time loving somebody. And it\u2019s interesting how they respond. I mean, it \u2014 a man and I sort of left each other a couple years ago. And so now, I don\u2019t have that intense need for him. I can love him in the way he should have been loved all along, with a deep attachment, a real understanding for who he is, and just giving him the time he needs with other people, not being at all upset if I don\u2019t hear from him. Released from that passion, you can finally love somebody in some new ways that can be very comforting. Not only for them, but for you. And then you can build a new kind of partnerships with them. It just feels like what we\u2019re talking about is like this kind of maturation of our collective capacity to\u2026 Too bad I didn\u2019t do it sooner. Yeah, well. That\u2019s how it goes. That\u2019s the maturation, right? I guess, just \u2014 oh, finally, I just wanted to note. I did \u2014 actually, Lily, my producer, found this blog that you wrote. OK. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve written on it recently, but for a while, and you always signed it, \u201CSempre ad astra.\u201D Always to the stars. Oh, yes. And I just \u2014 when I read that, I thought, \u201CShe\u2019s a romantic.\u201D I am. \u201CShe\u2019s a romantic.\u201D And so I wondered, oh, with this life you\u2019ve lived, and this work you\u2019ve done, how has the meaning of that term, and that thing, being a romantic, evolved for you? Can you talk about how it\u2019s changed over time? What a great question. Sempre ad astra. It\u2019s my family motto. Oh, it is? It\u2019s my family crest. My family apparently goes back to Holland in 1603. And on that family crest, or family tree, it says, \u201CSempre ad astra.\u201D And I\u2019ve loved it from that moment to this. And it\u2019s what I live. It\u2019s where I live is that term. You\u2019re going to make me cry, so I\u2019ve got to get my act together. Romance. Ask the question again. How \u2014 that romantic in you \u2014 your sense of what it means to be romantic or your experience with that, does that evolve\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve just sort of lived it. You just lived it. Yeah. I just am a romantic. It\u2019s a pain in the neck. I cry at parades. I look in a baby carriage, and it\u2019s going down the \u2014 baby going down the street, and say, \u201COh, boy, are you in for some rock and roll.\u201D I go into museums and I see all the little amulets and the pendants, and I think, \u201CSomebody gave that to somebody. 100,000 years ago. There\u2019s a love story there.\u201D I love poetry because it captures the passion of people around the world. It gives me a great sense of unity with all of humanity that ever was, and ever will be.
