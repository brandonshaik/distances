  "fullText": "I\u2019m not sure any living spiritual teacher has been recommended to me by more people across the years than Fr. Richard Rohr. Especially striking is how many men \u2014 diverse men \u2014 have told me they had trouble connecting to religion and spiritual practice, but that this Franciscan changed their lives, deepened their spirituality, helped grow them up. So, at long last, I\u2019m here to draw him out. And it\u2019s a conversation with expansive scope, much like his teaching and writing \u2014 on why contemplation is as magnetic to people now, including millennials, as it\u2019s ever been; on male spirituality and the epidemic of what he calls \u201Cfather hunger;\u201D and on the work of moving into what he describes as the second half of life. The first half is necessarily about survival, \u201Csuccessful survival,\u201D and preoccupations like titles and prestige and possessions with a dualistic, either/or sensibility. But all of that doesn\u2019t take us all the way to meaning, which is not a linear matter of age and time. To be a contemplative is to learn to trust deep time and to learn how to rest there and not be wrapped up in chronological time. Because what you\u2019ve learned, especially by my age, is that all of it passes away. The things that you\u2019re so impassioned about when you\u2019re 22 or 42 don\u2019t even mean anything anymore, and yet, you got so angry about it or so invested in it. So, this word \u201Ccontemplation,\u201D it\u2019s a different form of consciousness. It\u2019s a different form of time. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Richard Rohr is founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His many books include Falling Upward: A Spirituality for the Two Halves of Life, and most recently, Divine Dance. Well, I would like to start where I start all of my conversations, just hearing a little bit about the spiritual background of your childhood. Really? Yeah. Well, I\u2019m 73, so I was raised in what we Catholics call pre-Vatican II Catholicism. And not only pre-Vatican II conservative, but I was raised in the state of Kansas by German farm parents. So I had a very traditional upbringing, but it also provided a wonderful safe container as I like to call it. And in some ways, it no way prepared me for what my life has done or what\u2019s happened to it, but in other ways, there\u2019s a straight line from that very grounded beginning and where I am now. And how did you discover the Franciscans, or how did they discover you? Now again, this is \u2014 we\u2019re talking about the mid-1950s. OK. And if a young boy had had any kind of inner God experience, and you were a Catholic, the only thing to do was to be a priest. Now, when I was in the eighth grade, I read a beautiful little book, probably fanciful by today\u2019s standards, called The Perfect Joy of St. Francis. And I said, \u201COh my, I want to live a life like that.\u201D Then it so happened that a Franciscan from Cincinnati in full brown robe and white rope came and talked to our eighth-grade class, and he gave me this address off in Cincinnati. I went and joined, and it\u2019s a decision I\u2019ve never regretted. I\u2019ve had a wonderful life. So you \u2014 I wrote this down somewhere. You entered the Franciscan Order, became a friar, I believe \u2014 was it 1961? That\u2019s when I took first vows. That\u2019s right. And took first vows. And how old were you then? Oh, we\u2019d never let someone do this today, so I\u2019m embarrassed to say it, but I was just 19. I think they wanted to get us before we met a girl or something. But as you describe in your writing, the Franciscans then gave you a broad liberal arts education. Yeah, they really did. And you describe how this actually set off a very different second journey into rational complexity and also a different spirituality, it seems. I always feel like I was born at the perfect time. I was raised, of course, in the older, more stable world of the 1940s and \u201850s. And that gave me enough security and groundedness, so when everything blew open in the \u201860s, that\u2019s when I was studying philosophy and theology in this marvelous form that we were given, where we were really, as you said, given a liberal arts education, exposed to all of history and all of Christian history too. We studied historical theology, not just giving you the Catholic conclusions, as it were, but the whole process of \u2014 how do we come to this notion of grace? How did we come to this notion of Trinity? Or whatever it might be. And little did I think, even though it was a very stringent form of education \u2014 god, we studied a lot \u2014 but little did I think how well it would serve me that I can speak now with a certain kind of self-confidence that I\u2019m not un-Orthodox, or I\u2019m not crazy \u2014 maybe I am \u2014 but I have this assurance that I\u2019m speaking out of the perennial tradition, that these are not just my ideas. And that gives you a great confidence. A lot of people don\u2019t get that kind of education that they\u2019re speaking out of the perennial tradition. And I mean \u2014 I\u2019ve read you across the years. Oh, I\u2019m honored. I dipped into a number of books getting ready to be with you today. I felt like there were so many different directions we could take this conversation. Oh, I know. I kind of decided to at least begin with your work on Falling Upward, the second half of life. And I think that that\u2019s kind of a personal choice because that\u2019s kind of where I \u2014 that\u2019s the juncture I\u2019m at in my life, in a sense. But of course, it\u2019s not strictly chronological, which we\u2019ll talk about. That\u2019s right, it isn\u2019t. Because really, it\u2019s a template for a spiritual journey. Very good. And so \u2014 you know what? You just described \u2014 and you used some of the words and the images that are important to you in this \u2014 and this, I guess, was a phrase of Carl Jung, who popularized this notion of two halves of life, and that the preoccupations of the first half of life are there, and that they have their place. It is the raft but not the shore. But it is the raft. And you\u2019ve been talking about both your traditional, very stable identity, the container of your identity, of your upbringing, and then what the Franciscans gave you, is that container or identity that is that critical work, essential work, although everyone doesn\u2019t have such stability in their container or identity as you did, which is what we all struggle with. No, no. I know. What I\u2019ve been using lately, Krista, is \u2014 it\u2019s almost a simplistic metaphor, but I\u2019ve been telling the students at the school, \u201CPicture three boxes: order, disorder, reorder.\u201D And that if you read the great myths of the world and the great religions, that\u2019s the normal path of transformation. Now what conservative people want to do is just keep rebuilding the first box, \u201Corder, order, order,\u201D at all costs, even if it doesn\u2019t fit the facts or fit reality. What\u2019s difficult \u2014 and you just alluded to it \u2014 is so many people formed in the last 30 years were born into the second box of disorder. Right \u2014 don\u2019t have that order to begin with to reject and improve on. Yes, exactly. It\u2019s much harder to grow up if you were formed after 1968. And yet, what I always tell the folks is there\u2019s no nonstop flight from order to reorder. You\u2019ve got to go through the disorder. Your \u201Csalvation project,\u201D as Thomas Merton called it, it has to fall apart because it\u2019s not really love of humanity or God or truth. It\u2019s pretty much love of yourself. You don\u2019t know that, and that\u2019s not wrong. In fact, it\u2019s quite appropriate. But what the great religions are talking about and I\u2019m certainly talking about in the book Falling Upward is this necessary confrontation with the tragic, the absurd, what St. Paul would call for Christians the \u201Cfolly of the cross.\u201D Yeah, that disorder is part of the deal. And that\u2019s so counterintuitive, I know. And you also say in a very \u2014 and it just makes so much sense \u2014 it\u2019s such an interesting, different way to analyze this \u2014 but that we live in a first-half-of-life culture that most groups and institutions\u2026 And church. Right, including religious institutions \u2014 are in that order box. And as you say, 1968 happened, but these hallmarks of that striving, as you say, \u201Cto survive successfully,\u201D which has absolutely its place, we didn\u2019t necessarily outgrow that or move all the way to meaning in our institutional life or even \u2014 and culturally. If I said before that the conservative, which is where I was first raised, if they keep rebuilding the first box, so many progressive, academic, liberal, educated folks, they just keep sloshing around in the second box and almost resist any sense of order. I think of how the word \u201Cdisruption\u201D has become this catchword of the technological revolution. Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s a perfect example of it. And that makes it hard \u2014 frankly, I\u2019m no psychotherapist, but when I see the high amount of eccentric, unstable, mentally unhealthy people I meet today in almost every context, there\u2019s got to be some connection. That I find I give these retreats, and I talk about prayer and healing and transformation, but it\u2019s very hard to heal people in an unhealthy, unhealed culture. You send them back, and the incoherence of our system \u2014 sort of showing itself in our politics today \u2014 just undoes whatever moment of sanity, whatever moment of truth or freedom you might offer a person. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Franciscan priest, writer, and teacher Richard Rohr. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about what \u2014 so the move, the move from the order that is necessary to \u2014 from the raft to the shore, let\u2019s say. Because part of the reason, as you say, this is a choice each of us has to do this kind of shift to meaning, this trajectory to meaning. We are free to walk that path or not. And it involves crossover points, which involve \u2014 you used this phrase \u2014 \u201Cnecessary suffering,\u201D which is not something as human creatures we are drawn to do willingly. We often have to be kind of brought to our knees. It\u2019s moments of transition. I\u2019m afraid so. It\u2019s moments of crisis; it\u2019s thresholds; it\u2019s facing our shadows. Yeah. There\u2019s no other way, Krista, the human ego will give up control and hand over control until it has to. Why would we? And, you know, the 12-steppers have discovered this. They call it the first step, the admission of powerlessness. But who of us would take on suffering voluntarily? It pretty much has to be forced onto us. And it is, not a constant of life, but a very predictable occurrence in life again and again. Very predictable. I mean, the Buddha is even supposed to have said suffering is part of the deal. It\u2019s part of the deal. That\u2019s a translation from the P\u0101li, I\u2019m sure. My translation, yeah. So, just to echo what you just said, I mean, Joseph Campbell is someone who, at another era in American life, kind of gave voice to this. And you quote from him, and there is this beautiful quote from him, about that mythological trajectory. And I\u2019ve just been bumping into this everywhere I turn, so I\u2019m going to read it. Really? Yeah, just suddenly in the last month. Wow. \u201CWe have not even to risk the adventure alone\u2026\u201D Oh, yes. \u201C\u2026for the heroes of all time have gone before us; the labyrinth is thoroughly known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero-path.\u201D Here it is. \u201CAnd where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a God; where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; where we had thought to be alone, we shall be with all the world.\u201D Isn\u2019t that brilliant? It is brilliant. Oh god, to say that much in one paragraph. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Now, but what I also have been thinking about \u2014 and it very much seems relevant to me in the context of your work of really bringing these ideas and templates, this ancient wisdom or modern realities to modern people \u2014 one of the catchphrases that came down in American culture from the encounter with Joseph Campbell, a lot of it through Bill Moyers, was \u201Cfollow your bliss.\u201D Oh, yes. Right? And to me, that also is a kind of shorthand that epitomizes the first half life as opposed to that hard, risky work beyond it. \u201CFollow your bliss\u201D is not a good shorthand, and it\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s a very kind of American saying. Yeah, it is. It appeals. We can hear it. But Jesus would be a little beyond that when he says, \u201CTake up your cross,\u201D which is not so attractive. But he\u2019s much more leading us into the second half of life. Right. It seems important to me that you stress \u2014 although, there is a true progression of life that comes with age, which is about an accumulation of experience \u2013 but that this is not necessarily chronological and that everybody doesn\u2019t become an elder. Some people just get old. And it\u2019s also possible to be old and childish. It sure is. But I also experience \u2014 and I wonder if you have this experience too \u2014 that there\u2019s an important swath of the young among us who are, even at a young age, seeking a fuller and farther vision of who they want to be and how that is distinct from what they want to do or what they\u2019ve been taught. I gave a retreat two weekends ago in Santa Fe for 40 millennials, and what some of them have done already, for the poor in Africa, starting not-for-profits that care about this cause or that cause. And they conversed with me for a full weekend with some of the most mature, grounded, humble, responsive understanding to what I was saying, just proving the proof of what you just said. Some of the young people today feel like old souls. And some of my generation feel like old fools. It\u2019s like, god, have they learned anything? It\u2019s frightening. And it\u2019s exciting. Right, it\u2019s both. Yeah, yeah. A phrase that you use a lot that I\u2019d like you to just flesh out is an aspect of this progression towards meaning, towards spiritual fullness, is \u201Cliving in deep time.\u201D Just say what you\u2019re saying there. OK, well, let me say, first of all, I\u2019m not sure what I mean by that. But a phrase was used in medieval Catholic spirituality was \u201Cthe eternal now.\u201D \u201CWhen time comes to its fullness,\u201D is the biblical phrase. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told that in the Greek, in the New Testament, there\u2019s two words for time. Chronos is chronological time, time as duration, one moment after another, and that\u2019s what most of us think of as time. But there was another word in Greek, kairos. And kairos was deep time. It was when you have those moments where you say, \u201COh my god, this is it. I get it,\u201D or, \u201CThis is as perfect as it can be,\u201D or, \u201CIt doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201D or, \u201CThis moment is summing up the last five years of my life,\u201D things like that where time comes to a fullness, and the dots connect, when we can learn how to more easily go back to those kind of moments or to live in that kind of space. Now, I think that\u2019s what the tradition means by the word \u201Ccontemplation,\u201D that to be a contemplative is to learn to trust deep time and to learn how to rest there and not be wrapped up in chronological time. Because what you\u2019ve learned, especially by my age, is that all of it passes away. The things that you\u2019re so impassioned about when you\u2019re 22 or 42 don\u2019t even mean anything anymore, and yet, you got so angry about it or so invested in it. So already, the desert fathers and mothers discovered this word \u201Ccontemplation\u201D because I believe they found the word that most believers use, the word \u201Cprayer,\u201D to be so trivialized, so cheapened by misuse. Prayer was sort of a functional thing you did to make announcements to God or tell God things, which God already knew, of course. And they created another word to give us access to this deep time, and that word that kept recurring throughout the 2,000-year history of Christianity was the contemplative mind. It\u2019s a different form of consciousness. It\u2019s a different form of time. Let me add one thing. We used to, in Latin, use this phrase sub specie aeternitatis, and the old professors used to say, \u201CSub specie aeternitatis.\u201D And what it means \u2014 \u201Cin the light of eternity.\u201D In the light of eternity, this thing that you\u2019re so worried about right now \u2014 is it really going to mean anything on your deathbed? And for some reason, that had the power to relativize the things that a young man would get so impassioned about, positively or negatively. And those were various ways of directing us toward deep time. You can listen again and share this conversation with Fr. Richard Rohr through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Franciscan priest, writer, and teacher Richard Rohr. His books, workshops, and daily email meditations are considered essential by people across the spectrum of spiritual orientation. We\u2019re discussing male spirituality and how he became so formative for diverse men, including many who previously struggled with the very idea of religion or spiritual life. I also experience in your writing \u2014 this is the way I wrote it down, and I don\u2019t know if you say it this way \u2014 but one of the qualities of the first half of life or the early part of the spiritual life is dualistic thinking. Yes. That\u2019s almost all we have left. Right, and that\u2019s another way our culture is in the first half of life. But I kind of hear you saying also that contemplation is a very powerful antidote to dualistic thinking. Yes. Do you want me to talk about it? Yeah, yeah. Well, let me say, first of all, Krista, to cover my bases, I\u2019m not going to say that dualistic thinking is bad, per se, and non-dual is good, or I\u2019d be dualistic, wouldn\u2019t I? OK, I\u2019ll hold you to that. All right. So we\u2019ve got to succeed at clear-headed, non-fuzzy thinking. That\u2019s what education is about. And I want to say that, first of all, because so many people who come up to us religious folks and say, \u201CGod told me,\u201D and, \u201CI heard from the spirit,\u201D you find out they think they\u2019re at the non-dual level, but they really aren\u2019t. Do you understand? Yeah. So the normal way to get us through the day \u2014 I just drove over here where I\u2019m recording this from my house about 10 minutes away, and to turn right or left, I needed a good dualistic mind to even find the address or whatever it might be. So to get through the day, to be an engineer or a mechanic, a medical professional, you better have a good dualistic mind. But then you hit a ceiling, and it just doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work. But non-dual is where you move into both/and, where you don\u2019t look for all-or-nothing thinking. And we\u2019re seeing it in our political debates today. It\u2019s almost the only form of conversation left is all-or-nothing thinking. And it\u2019s amazing to me that we could have this many universities in this country and could have this many churches and synagogues and mosques and have so many people still at such a low level of consciousness that they read everything in terms of either/or. And that\u2019s why all of the world religions, not just Christianity, discovered that you needed a different kind of software to deal with mysterious things, holy things. And that software is contemplation. Is contemplation, the contemplative mind. Right. It\u2019s like putting on a different head, where \u2014 let me describe it this way, Krista \u2014 you let the moment, the event, the person, the new idea come toward you as it is, without labeling it, analyzing it up or down, in or out, for me or against me. It just is what it is what it is what it is, without my label. At this point in history, you have to teach people how to do that because none of us are taught how to do that. And that, for me, says that religion has not been doing its job for several hundred years because that\u2019s what we were supposed to evolve people to, a higher level of consciousness that would allow them to do things like love their enemies, overlook offenses. Yeah, that\u2019s non-dualistic thinking for you right there, love your enemies. The whole Sermon on the Mount of Jesus implies non-dual thinking. Yeah. Yeah, I think you said Jesus was the first non-dualistic religious thinker in the West. Of the West, that\u2019s right. And I think that the following you have, the way your words and teachings and speaking and your work touch people. I mean, I was reading \u2014 just getting ready to talk to you, I found this blog on the Patheos blog, somebody named Mark Longhurst, who \u2014 I\u2019m just going to read a little bit of it. \u201CNearly 1,500 people converged in New Mexico two weeks ago for Richard Rohr\u2019s second Conspire Conference and Living School Symposium. Our vocations differed, and our geographical homes stretched from Vancouver to Tokyo, but we all shared a common thirst to drink from the well of mystical Christianity.\u201D I mean, he goes on to say that he has a Masters of Divinity, two rooms and a basement full of theology, but had never experienced a contemplative form of prayer. So what you\u2019re describing\u2026 A lot of clergy haven\u2019t, yeah. Yeah, so what you say is when you offer that, when you introduce that, there\u2019s a great longing for it and a great curiosity about it. It is so humbling, Krista, when you see adult people just slip into such a beautiful peace and a beautiful freedom and a beautiful compassion. It\u2019s not this emotional religion that we\u2019ve come to expect, emotional religion should be, but just a quiet contentment, a quiet deepening, a quiet satisfaction that, \u201CI think the universe that I\u2019m a part of is beginning to make sense, and I\u2019m a part of it. I\u2019m a part of it, and therefore, I make sense.\u201D See, I\u2019m convinced that the discovery of a true God and the discovery of the true self are simultaneous journeys, and they feed one another. When you meet the true self, you\u2019re most open to a bigger, truer name for God. When you meet a bigger, truer, more loving God, you surrender to that same identity within yourself. And I think that starts to point also at the work you do with men in particular. I mean, you don\u2019t just work with men, but male spirituality, male growth. This is very striking to me, again, as I hear you, as I hear people talk about you, as people quote you to me. It\u2019s often men who say that this was their entry point, and they hadn\u2019t had an entry point to having a spiritual life, an inner life. And it\u2019s connected, as you said \u2014 you talk about the ways men in this culture have been taught and formed to strive for sex and prestige and possessions and titles, which is very much that stuff of the first half of life. The first half of life, yeah. And that, in fact, has been a straightjacket and an impediment to spiritual journey. I mean, obviously these are generalizations, but I know that it makes sense to me about the men in my life, certainly, my father and his generation, and it obviously makes sense to a lot of men you meet because I hear men talking about you everywhere I go. In the early \u201890s, I started reading everything I could cross-culturally on this rather universal phenomenon of male initiation, that on every continent, culture after culture, it was never assumed that the young male naturally grew up. He had to be taught. He had to be carefully taught, as Rodgers and Hammerstein would put it, and that was called \u201Cinitiation.\u201D So I, after reading these, oh, I don\u2019t know how many books, it all began to come together because the patterns were so similar. Basically, here was the assumption that cultures came to \u2014 and at this point in history, I don\u2019t think it needs much proof \u2014 that unless the male was led on journeys of powerlessness, he would always abuse power. And I know that seems damning, but the male just can\u2019t handle power unless he\u2019s somehow touched upon vulnerability, powerlessness. And it\u2019s no surprise that\u2019s the first step of the 12-step program. So I created a five-day event. We started doing them here in New Mexico at Ghost Ranch in 1996 to try to compress what was often several weeks or several months, but I knew I could never get men away that long, to try to give them a distilled experience of classic male initiation. And as you said, the response has been overwhelming. It\u2019s moved into 13 different countries now and so forth. I just got an email from the Czech Republic right before I came over here about \u2014 they\u2019re just ending them today outside of Prague, and 150 men are attending, and it\u2019s very gratifying. So I\u2019m grateful that God gave me a language that made sense to men, because a large percentage of men don\u2019t even take religion seriously, with good reason. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with Franciscan priest, writer and teacher, Richard Rohr. So I want to talk about some of the observations you make, some of the things you have heard and that are involved in your training, and actually I want to say it\u2019s \u2014 you spent a number of years as a chaplain at the Albuquerque jail. Yes, 14 years. It seems to me that this formed, this intensified your sense of urgency around this also, around men. Around the male issue in particular. Krista, I was jail chaplain here, a few blocks from where I\u2019m sitting right now, for 14 years, and if there was one universal I found among the men in particular, but certainly the young women too, was it was rare, if not never, to find someone in jail who had a good father. That\u2019s what got me just driven toward \u2014 we\u2019ve got to start growing up men because the male of the species does not know how to hand on his identity, his intimacy, his caring to his children. And the rage in the young male who never had a dad or had an alcoholic father or emotionally unavailable father or abusive father is bottomless. It\u2019s just \u2014 it moves out toward all of society, a mistrust of all authority, all authority figures, all policemen, of course, because \u2014 \u201CIf my dad abandoned me, I just basically don\u2019t trust older men, and I don\u2019t like older men.\u201D Now you can see what a bind this put us in when we defined God as masculine and called God \u201CFather\u201D exclusively. That\u2019s one metaphor, but it is a metaphor. And so people who never had a loving male in their life, and we come along and say, \u201CGod, the Father, loves you,\u201D they have no outlet to plug into, and that was my experience 14 years at the jail. I\u2019d go in these cells, and I mean, these young guys would almost worship me because they\u2019d never had an older man give them respect, give them attention, give them time. You used the language of \u201Cfather hunger.\u201D Yeah, father hunger. It\u2019s driving so many things in our culture, even this whole corporate world of the younger male\u2019s need to please the big daddy and get his pat on the back or his promotion. I think it\u2019s such a mystery of the human condition. I know, I know. That also, in some place you describe someone speaking to you about this father hunger and kind of in the middle of their life and realizing, calling it, saying they realized it was a chasm, a canyon, the emptiness and pain left of a relationship with the father that wasn\u2019t there. And the mystery that we can get very old, and that can still be with us. That this is not something that you just outgrow. No, no. And it\u2019s incredible how we can be defined by these broken relationships across a lifespan. Yeah, I\u2019ve had men older than me weep with me, still wanting a daddy, because they never had a father figure. It\u2019s heartbreaking, really. You say something that I just want to understand, where you say that \u201Cwhen positive masculine energy is not modeled from father to son, it creates a vacuum in the souls of men, and into that vacuum demons pour.\u201D And you say among other things, they seem to lose the ability to know how to read situations and people correctly. Why is that? Obviously, that can be crippling professionally, personally, but why \u2014 what is that connection? Here\u2019s the answer that comes to mind now. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best one. But young men who haven\u2019t been validated by an older male \u2014 because we look to our same-sex parent for validation \u2014 and when dad doesn\u2019t tell me I\u2019m a man or a good man or acceptable son, I think your first 30 years of life are so frantic, you don\u2019t have time to read inner emotions. Your emotional life \u2014 there\u2019s no subtlety to it, there\u2019s no nuance, there\u2019s no freedom, there\u2019s no grace, there\u2019s no time. I often see it in airports. In 46 years, I was on the road, and you\u2019d see these people rushing through airports, neither looking to right or left, like a deer caught in the headlights. When you\u2019re a deer caught in the headlights, trying to survive, I don\u2019t think you develop an inner world. Do you understand? It\u2019s just the whole life is externalized, and the soul is not born. And that\u2019s why, again, suffering for so many becomes the only path because it\u2019s the only thing strong enough to lead you into the world of grief, for example, or sadness or pain. And those tend to be the holes in the soul that awaken the inner world. And so an important part of every initiation rite was grief work, letting men get in touch with their unfinished hurt and begin to talk about it with other men. That\u2019s when the floodgates opened, and all of this success that they shined with externally they finally could admit was all a charade. Everything changed after that. I guess that\u2019s another mystery of the human condition, that if we can let ourselves feel what we think might kill us, it\u2019s the only way to grow to a place of being able to integrate it rather than be haunted by it. I have found in the men\u2019s work that a lot of men are afraid to expose this to their wives. I\u2019m not sure exactly why vulnerability is such a scary thing for a man. What I found on the men\u2019s retreats and the male initiation rites is that when a certain level of trust, vulnerability was achieved, men found it more open to talk to another man about this than even a woman. Now afterwards, they would go home and blurt it all out to their wife, too, but as much as they love their wife, I think so many men are afraid of looking weak or vulnerable around their wife or their girlfriend, yeah. Just coming back to this both/and thinking that is a quality of the second half of life, of spiritual deepening, you talk about this quality of \u201Cbright sadness\u201D that in that deepening, there is a gravitas and a lightness both. Say a little bit about the bright sadness. I remember some of the times when I was most happy, after \u2014 I used to spend the whole of Lent in a hermitage alone, and I\u2019d come back just sort of glowing, like a bliss ninny, for the next couple weeks. But when people would look at me, I remember again and again, they said, \u201CRichard, you look sad.\u201D And I said, \u201COh my gosh, do I?\u201D Because in fact, I\u2019m feeling exactly the opposite. And I don\u2019t know how that transferred to my face as sadness, but when you live at this deep time, deeper level of communion or love or grace or whatever you want to call it, there is a heaviness to it that \u2014 \u201CIs the rest of the world not seeing what I\u2019m seeing? Why are they so caught up in trivialities, and why are they making one another suffer so much?\u201D So it\u2019s the strangest combination of being able to hold deep sadness and deep contentment at the very same time. So I discovered that in myself, and my most wonderful moments were also my most sad moments, which leads you to a kind of participation in what I called earlier \u201Cthe one sadness,\u201D that your very fact of enjoying grace and love carries with it a dark side that I didn\u2019t deserve to know this, I didn\u2019t earn this, and most people think I\u2019m crazy if I try to talk about it. So the two intense emotions very often coexist in the contemplative mind. So that\u2019s what taught me this both/and world view, that opposites do not contradict one another. In fact, they complement and deepen one another. So recently, I took a break. I got some rest that I needed badly, and I was staying at a retreat center, and there was \u2014 actually, it was a meditation session I went to. And the person who was leading it read a passage from your book, Falling Upward and read the line \u2014 and it was about facing your shadow side as the only way to get bigger and deeper. And there was this sentence that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about, and I said, \u201CI\u2019m going to interview that guy in a couple weeks, and I\u2019m going to ask him about this.\u201D Well, I can\u2019t wait to hear what it is. \u201CI have prayed for years for one good humiliation a day, and then I must watch my reaction to it,\u201D which sounds so uncomfortable. There\u2019s nothing in me that wants to pray for one good humiliation a day. No, and there isn\u2019t in me either. I just said that to that group of millennials two weeks ago. Some years ago, I started recognizing that I was getting an awful lot of adulation and praise and some people treating me far more importantly than I deserved. And I realized I was growing used to it, that the ego just loves all of this admiration and projection. And a lot of it was projection. And I didn\u2019t want fame and well-knownness and guru status to totally destroy me, and so for me, this became a necessity, that I had to watch how do I react to not getting my way, to people not agreeing with me, to people not admiring me \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of them \u2014 and that I actually needed that. And so I do, I still, I ask God for one good humiliation a day, and I usually get it, one hate letter or whatever it might be. And then what I have to do, Krista, is I have to watch my reaction to it. And I\u2019ve got to be honest with you, my inner reaction \u2014 I\u2019m not proud to tell you \u2014 is defensive, is, \u201CThat\u2019s not true. You don\u2019t understand me.\u201D I can just see how well-defended my ego is. And of course, even your critics \u2014 and I have plenty of them \u2014 at least 10 to 20 percent of what they\u2019re saying is usually true. Right. And I\u2019ll recognize that very thing she\u2019s so angry at me for saying, I really could\u2019ve said it better, and I didn\u2019t use the right word. Now, a lot of Christians are trained to be what we call word police. They\u2019re always getting you on the right word, and it does drive you crazy after a while. So I try to learn from my critics, and they\u2019re often the best of teachers, frankly. There\u2019s a question \u2013 I think this may be on your website \u2013 so let me start this way. I often come to this point in a conversation as we\u2019re ending and will ask this huge, unanswerable question about just where somebody would start, about how your sense of what it means to be human has changed, has evolved, or is evolving. It seems to me that \u2014 you said right at the beginning of our conversation that a sense of God is all wrapped up with what it means to be human. There\u2019s this question on your website, and I kind of feel like it\u2019s connected to this, but I\u2019d like for you to think, to reflect on it, what it means, in any case. \u201CWhat if changing our perception of God has the potential to change everything?\u201D The Latin poet Terence is supposed to have said, \u201CNothing truly human is abhorrent to me.\u201D I think the truly human is always experienced in vulnerability, in mutuality, in reciprocity. When human beings try to deny their own vulnerability, even from themselves, when they cannot admit weakness, neediness, hurt, pain, suffering, sadness, they become very unhuman and not very attractive. They don\u2019t change you; they don\u2019t invite you. I think that\u2019s why Bren\u00E9 Brown, perhaps you\u2019ve interviewed her\u2026 Yes, I have. \u2026why her work is having such influence. Because like few other people, she has brought this central, for me, as a Christian, central, divine, gospel notion of vulnerability to really begin to make sense to a lot of people. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m anxious to present the vulnerable God, which, for a Christian, was supposed to have been imaged on the cross. But again, we made it into a transaction. Transaction isn\u2019t vulnerability anymore, really. Vulnerability transforms you. You can\u2019t be in the presence of a truly vulnerable, honestly vulnerable person and not be affected. I think that\u2019s the way we are meant to be in the presence of one another.
