  "fullText": "Matthew Sanford says he\u2019s never seen anyone live more deeply in their body \u2014 in all its grace and all its flaws \u2014 without becoming more compassionate toward all of life. He\u2019s a renowned teacher of yoga. And he\u2019s been paralyzed from the chest down since a car accident in 1978, when he was 13. He teaches yoga to the able-bodied. He also adapts yoga for people with ailments and disabilities, including military veterans. But Matthew Sanford has wisdom for us all on the strength and grace of our bodies, as we move through the ordinary span of our lives. The places you don\u2019t feel in you are graceful. They\u2019re not lost. They\u2019re not absence. They\u2019re part of your strength, of your fiber. In a piece of wood, it\u2019s not just the grains of wood. It\u2019s the empty space and spaces between the grains of wood that make it strong. It\u2019s both. And so the world gets lighter and easier when you include more of yourself here. \u201CThe Body\u2019s Grace.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. Matthew Sanford is an immensely energetic physical presence. He met me in my studio in his wheelchair in 2006, after he had just published his book, Waking: A Memoir of Trauma and Transcendence. Here he reads a passage from that: (reading) In principle, my experience is not so different from yours, it is only more extreme. \u2026 My mind-body relationship changed in an instant \u2014 the time it took for my back to break. But the changing relationship between mind and body is a feature of everyone\u2019s life. We are all leaving our bodies \u2014 this is the inevitable arc of living. Death cannot be avoided; neither can the inward silence that comes with the aging process. I now experience a different, more subtle connection between mind and body. It does not require that I flex muscles. It does not dissipate in the presence of increasing inward silence. \u2026It does require, however, that I seek more profoundly within my own experience and do so with an open mind. It means that I must reach intuitively into what may feel like darkness. How old were you when you were in the car accident? I was 13 years old. I was sleeping in the car when it happened. We were traveling from Kansas City, Missouri, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, because we spent Thanksgiving every year down with my mom\u2019s sister. And we were driving home and it was 31 degrees and misting. It seemed like a harmless day. And we were coming up upon a bridge and hit a slick \u2014 a patch of ice, preferential icing, you hear about that in Driver\u2019s Ed, I didn\u2019t really know what that really was, but we just slid off the embankment, went down, tumbled front to back three times in the car. My father and sister were killed. My mother and brother \u2014 my brother just jammed his shoulder, and my mother got a bruise on her face, on her eyes. And I was \u2014 I broke a lot of things: broke my back and my neck, both my wrists; I filled a lung with fluid and sustained an injury to my pancreas that didn\u2019t allow me to eat for about three months, two and a half months. So pretty as about as banged up as you can be on an accident. Mm-hmm. And it was pretty clear early on that you would be paralyzed, partially paralyzed, right? Well, yeah, you know, I didn\u2019t, I was in a coma so I was out of it for three and a half days. When I woke up, pretty soon I was told pretty quickly what happened. But what was so interesting about that, you know, is that I was 13; I could hardly process really what happened, you know, like I \u2026 Anyway, I mean, you\u2019d lost your father and your sister as well as\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s kind of like getting the weather reported to you. Yeah. You know, \u201CLaura and Dad are gone.\u201D And really, what was interesting about it is that I saw right away that my remaining family, they were desperate and they needed me to live. And it was a great way for me to attach to something living. So, you know, trauma happens not just to an individual. It happens to a whole community, to a family. And a lot of those initial early times was me connecting to my family and thinking, \u201COh, I need to live for them,\u201D right away, which I think was a healing story to myself. Right. You talk about healing stories in your memoir, and you talk about healing stories all the way through life. And it\u2019s often a line, right, that your mother and your brother needed you to live. It was a way for me to not feel how injured I was. The concept you\u2019re talking about of healing stories, I think it applies all over the place. We\u2019re constantly losing our trust in the world. Things happen, you know, even loss of childhood innocence, anything, you know, a death of a loved one \u2014 where suddenly the world changes its shape and you have to confront how are you going to connect back to the world. And can healing stories also be negative? I think healing stories can definitely be negative. But some of them can be good at the time. Like for example, for the first few years after I was injured, I would often be asked, \u201CWell, how\u2019d you get through everything you got through?\u201D And my answer would be, \u201CWell, I\u2019ve had two lives. I had one end at 13, my life as a walking person ended at 13. And I\u2019ve had this second life, so it\u2019s actually \u2014 I\u2019m kind of getting two lives.\u201D Well, that was a very smart healing story because I had to put away, at first, the childhood love of my body and trying to confront this new reality so that positing a discontinuity \u2026 You kind of, you just closed the door and \u2026 Yep. Yeah. And went on to the next one. And that was, at the time, exactly what I needed to say. However, eventually, and eventually through the practice of yoga, is that I needed to reconnect to the boy that loved his body, too. I needed to have all my ages, and the process of doing yoga allowed me to reconnect with the boy that\u2019s really disappointed about what happened to my body and what happened to my life. Here\u2019s another passage from Matthew Sanford\u2019s book, Waking. (reading) I am told repeatedly that my arms must now \u201Cdo double time for both my arms and my legs.\u201D Building in my mind is an image of my arms, a fantasy of a bodybuilder\u2019s arms rippling with flex. Many people add to this image. The rehab specialists do it to motivate me. A male nurse tells me that \u201Cchicks are going to dig it,\u201D and with approving eyes, my friends and family beam, \u201CWow, those arms are going to be huge.\u201D \u2026During my workouts in rehab, however, I drift out the window, not into my arms. \u2026 The rehab gym is full of people: standing people, walking people, sitting people, unable-to-talk people. Most of them are older, their dysfunction brought on by age. I am in between, too old for pediatric rehabilitation and definitely the lone boy beginning puberty. As I watch this scene, I set it against the view out the large south-facing windows. \u2026 I am not making the progress they would like, but through silence, I continue to smile. I am aging much too quickly. And so you had to grieve and it\u2019s almost like you had to grow into the stage where you could grieve at different levels. Then you also talk about your body grieved at different stages and different ways. Tell us about that, because, you know, you just, you have this \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use, you know, insight into your own body, that\u2019s too mild. And, and you\u2019re in touch with your body. You know, all these phrases are kind of clich\u00E9d, but you know things about your body, you\u2019ve had to live with it more intimately by way of the fact that it was damaged and\u2026 You know, for sure, and part of that was that I had to, I mean, the overt connections between my mind and my paralyzed body, the ones that are most easy and most efficient, aren\u2019t here anymore, the spinal cord. Which is that I think a thought and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m going to \u2014my hand is\u2026 You move. \u2026gesturing because I\u2019m animated in this conversation. Right. But same with your toes. You might be pressing or wiggling your toes at the same time. Right. I\u2019m shaking my foot, which I do when I\u2019m\u2026 Exactly. Yeah. I mean that\u2019s just part of, you know, the connection between your mind\u2019s intent and your body, so intimate they seem as one. Well, that connection got changed in my case. So what ends up happening with me is that I have to go inward and listen to levels that we all share. You have the same connections in your mind-body relationship that I use to do yoga and that I use in the rest of my life. And I believe that we need those connections. I am forced to do it. I am trying to reconnect my body\u2026 Right, because your more easy, obvious connections were severed. Right. And I think the rest of us often, we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t have to go there. I don\u2019t have to seek those subtle connections. One of the big healing things for me was to recognize that my paralyzed body didn\u2019t stop talking to my mind. It changed its voice. It went to a more subtle whisper that doesn\u2019t have as much clarity. It\u2019s sweeter, it\u2019s quieter and it doesn\u2019t as quickly react. I try to describe it as energetic presence. Like if you were to squeeze my ankle, it would feel like you\u2019re squeezing a tube of toothpaste, I can feel the surge up my body through my spine. But you feel it as energy rather than as nerve endings. Right. It\u2019s not as loud. It\u2019s not as crisp. For me, it\u2019s also very auditory, and I don\u2019t know if that is because I\u2019m just auditory, like that\u2019s how my brain\u2019s wired, or, you know, I don\u2019t know if I were more a visual person, but I kind of, I inwardly listen and hear. I pay attention and I can feel these changes. But, you know, at the same time, it\u2019s a lot easier for me to get distracted. If I\u2019m really nervous, I don\u2019t hear these levels as well. If I\u2019m at a rock concert, I don\u2019t hear it at all, right? I mean they\u2019re there. It takes some attention. And if you focus too much on it, you, you can amplify it to the point of exaggeration. I mean, there\u2019s a reason why people like me weren\u2019t surviving 2 million years ago. Right. This probably isn\u2019t great for survival when you\u2019re getting chased by tigers. Right. The flip side of this, what you\u2019re describing that you\u2019ve learned over these years \u2014 how many years is it? Fifteen years since I started yoga. Fifteen years. Is that you had real experiences, as you say, of leaving your body early on, not only after the accident, but just through excruciating rehabilitation and other operations that followed. I mean, tell me about that. It\u2019s so interesting because there\u2019s one experience in particular that happened to me soon, right when I got to the Mayo Clinic, that I call an overt, out-of-body experience, although I don\u2019t know what really happened. I was drugged when it happened. I don\u2019t know if I really was watching from above, but I had some screws twisted into my skull to stabilize my broken neck. And I got shown something there about the fluctuation and movement that can happen between mind and body, that there isn\u2019t the crisp boundaries that we think there are or that it\u2019s all the same. I got shown that, oh, what we think is all a tight knot, is actually much more loose. And so that insight got revealed to me early, and what ends up happening to me through the first three months where there\u2019s a lot of corrective violence, you know? Right. People don\u2019t get that hospitals are a violent place. Right. It\u2019s all good, and I wouldn\u2019t be here without it. Yeah. You know, corrective violence. We had to counteract what happened to me. But\u2026 You had to have your wrists broken again\u2026 Rebroken and\u2026 \u2026because they healed incorrectly. \u2026and the spine straightened and all the things that, like, literally. But, you know, when you take a knife and cut someone open, even if you\u2019re using anesthesia, it\u2019s still really hard on the body. But what I did is I learned how to move away from it to avoid pain. But one of the things that I think, my story, I think, is just more extreme. I think that we do that all the time through the course of our day. When we\u2019re daydreaming, you know, when we\u2019re just kind of not paying attention and kind of off somewhere else, that we have that capability within our mind-body relationship, within our consciousness, and that I got shown that really early and in a really dramatic fashion. And the question then became for me was, when I encountered then, after I start to feel better and I\u2019m still in the hospital, but I\u2019m aware enough to, what\u2019s going on here? I was being told over and over that I didn\u2019t have sensation. My sensation in my paralyzed body was over. And I came up to the doctors and I\u2019d say, \u201CWell, yeah, but I feel stuff. I feel tingling and kind of burning and itching and, you know, that\u2019s not exactly all the way gone.\u201D And they were really worried that I\u2019d think that would be helping me walk again, that that would be some like somehow, my spine\u2019s regenerating. The only healing they were focused on was like if my spine couldn\u2019t regenerate, then the rest of is just going to be lost. And those sensations, listening to my own experience, ends up being those sensations I were told weren\u2019t real then at 13 and I believed. I mean, you\u2019re only 13, you believe the adults around you. I mean, the innocence\u2026 And you believe doctors. All of us believe doctors when we\u2019re sick. Yeah. And we all believe doctors. They\u2019re well-intending, but what ends up happening is that level of mind-body connection is not one that we recognize here. It ended up being the cornerstone of my yoga practice. And what I only figured out over time was that it isn\u2019t just the ability to disassociate. I mean, that\u2019s, we kind of all know that. We kind, you know, we know that kids who were abused as children can\u2019t remember, and that\u2019s just something that we can do. But what I found that was so amazing was the silence in those experiences. And then for me with my particular injury, being a mind-body injury at core, it\u2019s got a physical cause, but the real injury I live with is that my mind has a harder time being in my body than yours does, that that was a form of silence too, that literally a level of silence or absence of normal sensation, silence, got infused into my mind-body relationship, but I think that\u2019s happening to all of us. I think that\u2019s aging. Like our mind-body relationship is changing over time. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Body\u2019s Grace\u201D \u2014I\u2019m with yoga teacher Matthew Sanford. The word \u201Cyoga\u201D means \u201Cto yoke,\u201D to dissolve separation between body, mind, and breath. It\u2019s an ancient discipline, with roots in Hindu metaphysics. For Matthew Sanford, yoga became a way to delve into the \u201Cinner silence\u201D he discovered after he became paraplegic. It\u2019s a silence he describes now as being at the core of his disability and all of human experience. I want you to talk about the term \u201Csilence.\u201D You use it a lot in your book. I mean, here, there are many evocative lines. I mean, here\u2019s one: \u201CThe silence is the aspect of our consciousness that makes us feel slightly heavy. It is the source of our feeling of loss, but also of a sense of awe.\u201D In another place you\u2019re talking about you\u2019re dealing with physicians and you say, \u201CThis silence demands grace, not rupture.\u201D Really talk to me about what that silence is, because you\u2019re using the word in a completely particular way to your experience. Not an easy question\u2026 No, I know. It\u2019s a big word. \u2026 because I\u2019ve been trying to define it many, many times. It\u2019s a big word, the way you use it. But part of what I try to do is make it seem more ordinary. When I do compare it to our experiences, I, you know, like when you\u2019re washing your dishes for another day after another meal and you have that kind of quiet feeling, I think we all know what I\u2019m talking about. You can kind of feel it, when you feel beauty. It\u2019s the silence within us. Mm-hmm. For example, you know, when you learn to soften your organs of perception, let\u2019s say if I\u2019d ask you right now to soften the inside of your mouth, and in particular, relax your tongue, something will happen to your perception inward in your body and you will hear something different. The world will suddenly get a little quieter; you\u2019ll feel a different kind of presence in you. That\u2019s what I mean by silence. And I do think it\u2019s an ordinary experience. I think that we have it all the time. We just don\u2019t recognize it. I think that\u2019s where stress lands. I think that there\u2019s an invisible aspect of our consciousness that\u2019s here, that we need to manage better, we need to be more present with for a lot of reasons because I think this same silence we\u2019re talking about both connects us to other people and separates. It goes either way. In the way I understand it, it also goes towards life or towards death. Or it is both. You know what I mean? It\u2019s not like the silence can only go toward life. In fact, I kind of think that level of absence that we carry within us that I\u2019m calling silence is itself some level of dying or death that we carry within us. And so it\u2019s not that the silence can go away from it. I think in trying to listen, for example, to the silence of my paralysis, that it itself has texture, that it itself has life in it. And it\u2019s a kind of life that mixes. In a yoga pose, for example, you try to make what I would say the silence congruent with physical exertion, not just physically exert with a lot of will. Think about what you can feel in your body. You only feel a little portion of it. If I were to ask you to stretch the intercostal muscles right now, you wouldn\u2019t exactly know how to do that. Yeah. Like you have silence too in your mind-body relationship. If I\u2019d ask you to lift your inner \u2014 the arches of your feet directly, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. If you were to try to go there, you would encounter a wall, a brick wall. Now, the question is, is it just a brick wall? Or if you start, and start to listen and to be quiet, you can start hearing that brick wall. It isn\u2019t just a wall. It\u2019s a different quality of awareness that\u2019s residing within you, that in that silence, sounds can gain texture again. And I say one place the moon might reveal itself, life reveal itself again, only darker. I compare it to walking from a well-lighted room into a dark one. At first you can\u2019t see anything. But if you sit and you pause and you listen, usually there\u2019s enough light to get across the room, you know? It\u2019s not going to be like turning the light back on, but in fact, the world gets this other kind of texture that makes it beautiful. Also makes it scary in the dark. You know, it goes either way. Here\u2019s another passage about this silence, from Matthew Sanford\u2019s memoir. (reading) Imagine walking from a well-lit room into a dark one. Imagine the darkness as a visual expression of silence. My rehabilitation made a mistake with the silence by focusing on the absence of light. It too quickly accepted the loss and taught me to willfully strike out against the darkness. It told me to move faster rather than slower, push harder rather than softer. It guided me to compensate for what I could not see. Another course of action, however, is patience. Stop moving, wait for the eyes to adjust, allow for stillness and then see what\u2019s possible. Although full-fledged vision does not return, usually there is enough light to find one\u2019s way across the room. After a while, the moon may come out, sounds might gain texture, the world might reveal itself once again, only darker. Tell me how you became aware of the silence. Um, or when I started to see it in my body. Yeah. See that was one of the big breakthroughs that came to me through yoga is that in a way, I was aware of the silence. You know, I still am. I mean I\u2019ve had a set of experiences in my life \u2014 and it\u2019s not just the car accident. There\u2019s a lot of trauma going through my story in the last 27 years. And it makes me feel separated. I feel a little bit like I\u2019ve got a set of experiences that make me different than other people. I mean, a lot of my close friends are now reading the Waking for the first time and knowing that I went through stuff that they\u2019re shocked at. But that\u2019s always been between me and them, that there\u2019s been a gulf between us, that silence has always been there. But I think we all feel that. We all feel it, individuals. I mean, there\u2019s a whole movement of existentialism that talks about the radical separation of the individual from everything else. Right, right. And I think they\u2019re describing some of the same stuff, that they\u2019re trying to put in context and into story \u2014 an experience that we all have, where we all move. But I think that what\u2019s happened to you is that with yoga, in particular, you\u2019re kind of staring that straight on and not accepting it as a wall or as a separation. And to get to your \u2014 the practical answer to your question is that when I started to do yoga, there was a time where all, and I knew I could feel stuff, I could feel. The first time I met my yoga teacher, I was so lucky I got\u2026 Tell me that story about how you came to meet her or be doing this. Did you know you wanted to do yoga? No. I was in \u2014 I was having lots of pain in my body, because my body has a lot of pain in it. But I was at a body worker and she says, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you try yoga?\u201D And so I tried yoga because I thought, \u201CWell, a 4,000-year-old discipline that\u2019s about integrating mind, body and spirit seems like a good place to start.\u201D But then I got extraordinarily lucky. The first teacher I met, Jo Zukovich, that relationship, I don\u2019t think I would, I know I would not be where I am now and been able to stick with if I also hadn\u2019t had an extraordinary personal relationship with my yoga teacher and her family. They kind of took me in. Because it was hard, because I had a lot of things, when I was first starting yoga, a lot of, like I said, I was asleep in the car. I had no memory of that day at all. I had a lot of post-traumatic flashbacks where I was encountering that my body had memory. And that body had stored it, right? Had stored it. And, in fact, that I had left my body to avoid the pain. But what I had done is made my body absorb it alone. So as I started to reconnect to my body, I had to reconnect to the fact that not only was it conscious in a way that I hadn\u2019t thought was even possible\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s got memory. I still \u2026 Your body was alert to that car accident. The whole thing. I don\u2019t have any visual memory of that day. I can feel the skid off the bridge, I can feel where the blow came from, my lung was collapsing, I had trouble breathing, I can feel that angst. It\u2019s all in my body. And so I had to, like change. It\u2019s like a physical narrative rather than an oral narrative. Exactly. And it completely changed my life. But what\u2019s ended up happening, and this gets back to your earlier question, is that what ends up happening is that that silence that I used to disconnect, I start to realize is embodied in my paralysis and that the paralysis is itself a teacher of presence to me. And I compare it to an artichoke. You take an artichoke and you pull, as you eat an artichoke, you pull off leaf after leaf \u2014 thriving muscle off of my outer body, off of my legs, after muscle \u2014 and eventually you get to the heart of the artichoke. That\u2019s what I think I experienced in my paralysis. I experienced what existence would be like before toil, before action. Like this is what it is when it just hums. And to whatever extent I can feel and intuit that, which I call energetic awareness or sensation, I\u2019m getting a glimpse into a level of existence that we have a hard time hearing. And that\u2019s part of why I came back to tell my story. First of all, you practice Iyengar yoga, which, I mean, it sounds to me, from the way I read the story, you kind of happened upon this teacher who happened to teach Iyengar yoga. I mean, there are many forms of yoga \u2026 Oh, yeah. \u2026 but this one is about alignment and precision, which \u2026 Is what I need, yeah. \u2026 seems perfectly suited to you, with your spine. And also it focuses on each individual pose, right, instead of sequences that have to go together. So Mr. Iyengar, he\u2019s alive in Pune, India, still; he reveals the universe of yoga in each individual pose. There\u2019s a level of depth and precision to it that\u2019s mind-boggling, but it was exactly what I needed because I could only do and started off with a few poses. But I could see the whole depth and clarity of yoga right away because each yoga posture, regardless of what it is, have developed, I think, over time because they seal energy or they make it resonate through the mind-body relationship. The particular positions make us, it flowed differently. I can feel that. That\u2019s how I can teach you yoga if you wanted to do yoga, is that I can feel that energy flowing. Right. Because the doctors will tell you that you don\u2019t have sensation in your legs, right? Mm-hmm. But you say, \u201CMy mind can feel into my legs.\u201D Yeah. What\u2019s that like? If you\u2019re really, really tired and you finally get into bed, and you have that sinking feeling, you\u2019re laying there and you feel that \u201Cah\u201D relief, and you feel like you\u2019re falling even though you\u2019re just laying there, you keep falling, \u2019cause you\u2019re so tired, that level of dropping into your body and feeling, like if you were to take that experience and start listening then to your body from that level, that\u2019s what I think it is. It\u2019s a landing, it\u2019s a grounding, it\u2019s a feeling of embodiment. There\u2019s a reason why, when my son who\u2019s six is crying, he needs a hug. It\u2019s not just that he needs my love. He needs boundary around his experience. He needs to know that the pain is contained and can be housed and it won\u2019t be limiting his whole being that he can \u2014 he gets a hug and, hmm, he drops into his body. And when you drop into your body, paradoxically, typically pain is less. Pain gets more intense and more \u2026 When you\u2019re afraid and try to keep it at bay. \u2026 and then pull out of it, it really denies freedom. And it\u2019s a great short-term strategy. That\u2019s what I did when I was 13. I pulled out of my body to get it, but it\u2019s a short-term strategy. And a lot of the process of my life is like embodying again and letting \u2014 and surrounding what\u2019s going on, so I can be part of the world.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. Ms. Tippett: I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CThe Body\u2019s Grace,\u201D with yoga teacher Matthew Sanford. He\u2019s been describing his arc of learning to be physically whole. In 1978, he was paralyzed from the chest down, in a car accident that killed his father and sister. He\u2019s written a book called Waking: A Memoir of Trauma and Transcendence. It\u2019s also a reflection on deeper lessons Matthew Sanford\u2019s life has for our larger culture. Here\u2019s another passage he read for me: (reading) As I wake up to the horror of traumatically induced body memories, I am forced to feel death \u2014 not the end of my life, but the death of my life as a walking person. \u2026 In principle, my experience is not that uncommon, only more extreme. \u2026 If we can see death as more than black and white, as more than on and off, there are many versions of realized death short of physically dying. The death of a loved one sets so much in motion. \u2026 Then there are also the quiet deaths. How about the day you realized you weren\u2019t going to be an astronaut or the queen of Sheba? Feel the silent distance between yourself and how you felt as a child, between yourself and those feelings of wonder and splendor and trust. Feel your mature fondness for who you once were, and your current need to protect innocence wherever you might find it. The silence that surrounds the loss of innocence is a most serious death, and yet, it is necessary for the onset of maturity. What about the day we began working not for ourselves, but rather with a hope that our kids might have a better life? Or the day we realized that, on the whole, adult life is deeply repetitive? As our lives roll into the ordinary, when our ideals sputter and dissipate, as we wash the dishes after yet another meal, we are integrating death, a little part of us is dying, so that another part can live. Ms. Tippett: You know, I want to talk about how the way you\u2019ve lived with what happened to you. I think our culture tends to like heroes, it tends to have phrases like \u201Cbeating the odds\u201D and \u201Cconquering\u201D and \u201Cbeing victorious.\u201D And I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to diminish the example of somebody like Christopher Reeve, but, you know, that was an example of someone for whom, um, healing was only going to be reversing \u2026 Overcoming. \u2026 reversing what had happened to him. Mm-hmm. And that would be a perfect example of a healing story. And I think that\u2019s a very pervasive one in our culture. Yeah. And when it comes to healing, when it comes to a whole bunch, when it comes the aging, we admire that 80-year-old guy that runs a marathon. Yeah. You know, we want to see that proof that mind can overcome matter because the body is going to be what ends up shutting down. And believe me, I didn\u2019t get this right away. I mean, I broke my leg doing yoga, you know? I\u2019m \u2026 Because you were trying to be heroic. Right. Oh, I was \u2014 all of a sudden, I wanted to do the poses and, like, show how much I could do and, whack, and \u2026 Stretch it to the limit. And I, unfortunately, had to not, you know, I\u2019m not the sharpest tool in the shed. I had to break a bone again before I learned nonviolence. You mean nonviolence to your body? To my body. But you need all kinds of strength. You need to be able to also \u2014 and it\u2019s overused. And I am now, just now, after 15 years of yoga, understand this word deeper and deeper, and that is \u201Csurrender.\u201D And it comes from being more present, surrendering into the world, feeling more. But I don\u2019t mean intellectually. I mean literally having your body as if you\u2019re getting hugged like my son. It has that like, \u201Cah\u201D feeling. That is really strong. But your heart feels vulnerable when you let yourself be in the world like that. That\u2019s why we avoid it. You know, the kind of strength that I\u2019m talking about that has guided a lot of my exploration makes you feel, oh, so vulnerable and makes you have to feel more. In your story, there were times when you \u2014 say, one stage of your understanding of this and your grappling with it was to decide that you still had the use of the upper half of your body and that you would make that as strong as possible, and you would live in that part of your body and kind of declare the rest of it gone. That\u2019s how I was guided to believe, in my opinion. Right. And did you, in fact, feel more invulnerable when you had made that kind of declaration? Um, you know, did I feel invincible? No. But that idea of being willful and being able to attack any problem with a lot of will \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 that makes you feel a type of control over the world \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 that can make you feel less vulnerable. But I also know the unthinkable is possible. You can have as much control as you want, but the world is so big. Life does its own thing with us on some level. You know what\u2019s so interesting? The, you know, the phrase \u2014 I think all the language around something like a mind-body connection is a little bit loaded, just like a lot of the language around religion and spirituality can sound New Age-y. And, I mean, you had the experience with physicians that you did yoga and they thought of you as New Age-y. And I think part of that is just a language problem. But what you\u2019re pointing out is that a lot of our \u2014 the culture\u2019s glorification of will and triumphing by determination, that\u2019s also a form of mind-body, you know, we\u2019re asserting the mind-body connection without calling it that. Right. It\u2019s a form of integration. Dominance over bodies \u2026 Right. \u2026 is what human beings have done for thousands of years, whether it be nature, whether it be each other. That it\u2019s \u2014 my whole point is that we also need \u2014 that\u2019s one thing we want in the tool belt, to use will when you need to have it. But we, I think, are just on the beginning of realizing that there are many other ways to integrate with body. And, in fact, I believe our human survival over time is going to depend on us getting much more subtly aware of bodies. And even in bodies that don\u2019t function with the perfection to which we aspire, which, in fact, is a fallacy. Which is one of the things about yoga \u2026 And I mean, aging is an example of that as well. And also, you know, I also specialize in adapting yoga to people with disabilities. Right. And one of my \u2014 it makes me love yoga so much more. Yoga can travel through any body. It\u2019s not about the perfect pose. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s like literally it\u2019s a phenomenon that occurs at your mind\u2019s intent and your body\u2019s limits. I thought when I first started teaching adaptive yoga, that\u2019s what I started teaching first. I thought, \u201CWell \u2026 And adaptive yoga means? Just adapting yoga poses and whatever you can to allow or have someone that lives with not as able a body. For whatever is physically possible. Right, to do whatever they can do with yoga, adapting it to someone who doesn\u2019t have as easy of a mind-body relationship. But you see in class what they\u2019re already doing. The things that some of my students already do just to live their everyday life are themselves miraculous solutions to a mind-body problem. It\u2019s not, like, \u201COh, do it this way. This way is better. This way is better.\u201D You better make sure you understand why they\u2019re moving the way they\u2019re moving, what problem it\u2019s solving. And it makes you just go, \u201COh, my goodness, there is so much ingenuity in the human mind-body relationship.\u201D And then you try to help them do it with not so much will. I want to ask you about something you wrote. \u201CI have never seen anyone truly become more aware of his or her body without also becoming more compassionate.\u201D What\u2019s that about? What\u2019s that? Why is that? Well, it\u2019s just true. It\u2019s an observation. But why do you think it\u2019s true? I think it\u2019s true for a lot \u2014 I think exactly \u2014 in my opinion, when mind separates from body, we get more self-destructive. We get more destructive in general. If we\u2019re more separate from our own selves, are we more separate from others as well? I think so. As you\u2019re more in your body, you do feel more connected to people. You think about the importance of other life. And when you\u2019re part of the world, it\u2019s much harder to not feel compassion about the world. Mr. Sanford: All right, so now, you know, lay flat on your mat \u2014 are we staggered in here? Everyone OK? We visited a class Matthew Sanford taught one Monday evening at the Courage Center, a rehabilitation complex for people with all kinds of physical challenges in Golden Valley, Minnesota. He\u2019s also worked in recent years with military veterans. In this class, volunteers assist the students, some of whom are paraplegic, to move their bodies into the poses Matthew Sanford calls out from a mat. (instructing class) So now everyone that\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re trying to get everyone all set. But if you\u2019re already laying on your back, take your arms over your head. Take your arms over your head. Straighten your arms. Straighten your arms and stretch out through your heels. Literally grow. Get taller. But then I want to \u2014 have you pick a point in the center of your body, like lay in \u2014 where your back is touching the floor in the mid-back. Like literally try to grow from the center of your body out through your fingertips, out through your heels. One of the things we give up, you know, when we have difficult mind-body relationships is we give up presence, stretching from the fingertips out through the feet. And I don\u2019t even care if you can\u2019t physically do it, right? I want you to start seeing your presence in your body as if it\u2019s growing, like it\u2019s organic and it includes your body. Mm-hmm. So this next couple of breaths, breathe with your back body, breathe \u2026 Watch video and see photos of Matthew Sanford\u2019s adaptive yoga class at onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, with Matthew Sanford on \u201CThe Body\u2019s Grace.\u201D And I have to say, I\u2019m sitting here with you and your body is very alive and it seems to me to be very connected. You know, you\u2019re in a wheelchair, but you\u2019re animated. You have incredible energy. And do you use that word \u201Cdisability\u201D for yourself? Do you think of yourself as disabled? And if you do, what does that mean? I have a whole bunch of thoughts about that. I get tired of having the language have to be correct. Yeah. And I think the language is the first step of moving consciousness, so I tolerate it, you know? But when someone tells me that I can\u2019t call myself disabled or a paraplegic or something, or whatever the word may be, I kind of want to look at him and go, \u201CWait, it\u2019s my experience.\u201D And probably \u2014 don\u2019t want you to use the word because it\u2019s uncomfortable for somebody else. For them. Yes. Well, that\u2019s my point, you know? It\u2019s like I realize it\u2019s an attempt to bring more awareness to the issue that surrounds disability. But I think it brings too much morality around it, like there\u2019s a right thing and wrong thing to say. And I think that that\u2019s not consciousness, that\u2019s just words. OK. Right. So that\u2019s the level on that. But do I think of myself as disabled? I have to tell you honestly that there are times, even now, 27-plus years later, where I will see my shadow and be shocked. You know, like I\u2019ll look at it. It\u2019s in a wheelchair and it\u2019s like, \u201CWow, that\u2019s what I look like when I\u2019m wheeling through the world.\u201D Like, I don\u2019t, but at the same time, I definitely am disabled. But my life force isn\u2019t completely determined by the ability to flex muscles, that there\u2019s something here. I don\u2019t know what it is and I don\u2019t care of it\u2019s neurophysiologically explained, but there\u2019s a presence here that flows through us that isn\u2019t solely determined by the fact if I could stand up or not. And I\u2019ve always felt that surge. I also know that that connection was what made me such a good athlete as a little kid. It\u2019s like, you feel a free throw. And it comes from your legs, and it comes from your arms, and it comes from unity. All that unity is still here, right? I just can\u2019t quite stand up. So, you know, you describe in your book that at different times in your life, and through all the operations, and your initial injury and other injuries, you then, at some point, started to realize that healing could look like something different than being able to walk again. I mean, do you feel that you are healed? I think my mind-body relationship continues to heal, that as I practice yoga and pay attention and be in love with the world, actually, it continues to heal. Before I started yoga, I really did feel like a floating upper torso. And like when I\u2019d be talking here with you, I\u2019d be more talking just with my upper body. You can still see it. And a lot of people have \u2026 Yeah, but you are \u2014 I feel like you\u2019re talking with your whole body. The whole thing. It\u2019s moving through the whole thing. And that presence was not realized in me before I started yoga. And you\u2019re saying that that presence is about your mind being connected to your physical \u2026 And like I\u2019m talking with you with my whole being. It\u2019s like yoga poured water on me and through me. And I was really dry and kind of tired before and that there was so much more here that needed to just kind of be here, right? And so I practice yoga not just to become, like, really great at yoga poses. I practice yoga to feel this. Um, you say at one point in your memoir that you completely disagree when people say, \u201CMy body is failing me.\u201D I\u2019m in my 40s too. You know, people start to say this after they\u2019re 40. It\u2019s your eyes or your knees, right? But you say that that\u2019s absolutely wrong. And I say that and it\u2019s full of grief for me because I took advantage of my body as a 13-year-old by leaving my body to absorb all the trauma that it did. And one of the lessons that I\u2019ve learned is it was my body that kept me living. Your body, for as long as it possibly can, will be faithful to living. That\u2019s what it does. I mean, even despite the fact that it \u2014 that there\u2019s decay that comes with age. It\u2019s coming apart. It\u2019s because \u2014 like, my body didn\u2019t ask to get hammered and break, and to have its spine shredded, and many bones broken. And it went, \u201COK, let\u2019s regroup. Let\u2019s go.\u201D And only a little part of my body didn\u2019t heal. Only \u2014 you know, an inch or two of my spinal cord was not able to regenerate. It went to work, right, and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll do. It might get confused. It might not know how to grow the right cells, but I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s moving toward living for as long as it possibly can. So if we know that about our bodies, even as we age, even as there are things happening in them that we don\u2019t like, how might we live differently in that awareness? You know, there\u2019s a thing in yoga. It\u2019s called pranayama. It\u2019s yogic breathing. And you breathe in a yoga pose for the spaces \u2014 I believe this \u2014 for the spaces that you can\u2019t feel. You don\u2019t just breathe for the bicep that you can really flex. You are trying to get life force through the spaces you can\u2019t feel. When you do, your balance increases, your strength increases, your flexibility increases. I think that when you talk about in terms of honoring your body, but don\u2019t make that a moral insight, you know? Like, \u201COh, no, I better only eat this or not that,\u201D and get all caught up in \u2026 Right. Right. And that is the other way we do it too. And that\u2019s the other way we do it. Yeah. We work until we think that that\u2019s a moral insight. So, you know, grace \u2014 I like grace \u2014 or responsibility to my body. That, boy, doesn\u2019t inspire me at all. Mm-hmm. And you\u2019re saying be graceful with your body, is that what you mean? Or know that the places you don\u2019t feel in you are graceful. They\u2019re not lost. They\u2019re not absence. They\u2019re part of your strength, of your fiber. In a piece of wood, it\u2019s not just the grains of wood. It\u2019s the empty space and spaces between the grains of wood that make it strong. It\u2019s both. And so the world gets lighter and easier when you include more of yourself here. And how do you think about \u2014 deal with those parts of your body that you don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening to them, the skin that\u2019s aging, the knees that hurt? I mean, those are minor problems compared to the pain that you \u2026 No, no. But \u2014 no, this is hard. This takes patience. I\u2019d like to tell you there\u2019s a one magic insight and suddenly it\u2019s all easy. No, it\u2019s work, like everything else. I know, I think more \u2014 I don\u2019t know more deeply, but differently than most people, how much my body has absorbed and moved toward living still. So I look at \u2014 you know, I have places \u2014 skin on my body, you know, old pressure sores and old stuff that happened \u2014 that you can see the skin is struggling to stay and hold. I don\u2019t, \u201COh, it\u2019s not holding, dang it.\u201D I feel like, \u201CMan, it\u2019s working as hard as it can,\u201D you know? How are you going to see it? Are you leaving here? Is your presence changing as you leave here that allows for other things? Yeah, my body does not heal as well as it used to when I was 13. That\u2019s true. My physical body doesn\u2019t do it. But because of the compassion I can feel for my body, for others, something else is healing. You have a six-year-old son. There\u2019s nothing in the world more embodied than a six-year-old boy. Pure energy. Yeah. Pure physicality. How does your son think about your body? I was so worried about this before I was a parent. I thought that he would have more issues than he does. He likes the idea that he\u2019s going to be taller than me sooner. OK. And he hasn\u2019t quite grasped that I\u2019m actually almost six feet tall. Because you\u2019re in a wheelchair. Right. Yeah. He doesn\u2019t quite get that. So he likes that part. He\u2019s always kind of measuring himself against me. Paul is amazing. There are a couple of times when we\u2019ve been in, like, on \u201CDaddy and Me Days.\u201D There is one story that it was a relay race at, like, his nursery school or preschool. It was like this kind of running down this mat and going to the end and coming back. And I couldn\u2019t line up with them and do the relay with them, so the other dads and sons were doing it. But he did it on his own right down along the side, and ran down and then came back, and came back and gave me a big high-five. And so he knows that I can\u2019t do all the things. But when he came back and high-fived me and went, \u201CHey, we did it anyway,\u201D it was like silence and love. Ms. Tippett: Matthew Sanford\u2019s book is Waking: A Memoir of Trauma and Transcendence. His DVD is Beyond Disability. He\u2019s the founder and president of Mind Body Solutions in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Like many of you, I practice yoga, as do some of my colleagues: vinyasa, Iyengar, hot yoga. You can read about our personal experiences on our blog, and we\u2019d welcome your stories too. Find that on our website \u2014 onbeing.org \u2014 along with another conversation with a wonderful teacher of yoga, Seane Corn. You can take in a video of her demonstrating what she calls \u201CBody Prayer.\u201D It\u2019s a stunning few minutes of grace, athleticism and spiritual focus. And you can watch my in-studio conversation with Matthew Sanford or listen again and download this show. That\u2019s all at onbeing.org. And if you spend time on Facebook, Tumblr, or Twitter, you\u2019ll find us in all those places too. And then, now, take your hands out straight, straight over you like you\u2019re getting long, like you\u2019re Superman flying through the air. And then, even if you can\u2019t do what I\u2019m about to say, it\u2019s OK because I can\u2019t do it either, right? I want you to lift both your hands and your legs off the mat and extend. Shalabasana. Even if you can\u2019t do it, Tim, come on, do it anyway. And breathe, and then release. Take a break. That\u2019s a hard pose, by the way."
