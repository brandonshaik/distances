  "fullText": "The greatest mysteries are the simplest ones. Those are the ones that we confront every day. I had a conversation once with a priest \u2014 I was traveling and went to confession in this very remote place. And suddenly he said, \u201CWell, we don\u2019t know what God is, do we?\u201D Right. What it says is, we \u2014 every time we try to identify God, we are sure to identify what he is certainly \u2014 what she is certainly not. And the genius of God, to dwell where we would least likely look \u2014 within the depths of our own being, our own shallowness, our own darkness, our own humanity. Martin Sheen has appeared in over 100 films, including Apocalypse Now. He\u2019s best known on television as President Bartlet in seven seasons of The West Wing. But he has another, lesser-known life as an activist. He\u2019s been arrested over 60 times in vigils and protests about race, war, and nuclear weapons. He is driven by a deep and joyful faith, which has been at the center of his identity since he had a crisis and reawakening at the height of his fame in mid-life. And my 2015 conversation with Martin Sheen is full of wisdom and delight. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Martin Sheen was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio to an Irish mother and a Spanish father. His mother died when he was 11, and his father raised him and nine siblings on his own. I\u2019d love, before we start, for you to say your legal name, the name you were born with. I want to hear you say it. Oh, yes. Me llamo Ram\u00F3n Est\u00E9vez, a.k.a. Martin Sheen. OK. All right. Wonderful. So one thing that\u2019s interesting to me is, it seems to me that especially when you were playing President Bartlet on The West Wing \u2014 journalists have written a lot, across the years, about your progressive politics. And Catholics, here and there, have paid attention to your religious foundations, which, in fact, underpin your progressive politics. I experience you to be a very integrated person \u2014 have an integrated experience and conscience. And so I feel like there are these two people who the public knows, there\u2019s Martin Sheen and Ram\u00F3n Est\u00E9vez, and I want to talk to both of you, or all of you, as it were. OK. And I feel like that\u2019s who you live as, but I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t feel like this person gets drawn out all the time. So here we are, all three of us. OK. Good deal. Yeah, that\u2019s a good way to put it. Yeah, yeah, because I do feel, sometimes, I live in a split personality. Well, OK, we\u2019ll see what we can \u2014 we\u2019ll unite that. So there\u2019s this question I always ask when I start an interview, and I\u2019m interested to know how you would start to describe the religious and spiritual background of your childhood. How would you describe that now? Well, it was the foundation, really, of the rest of my life. I was raised in a large, very poor family of immigrants. I was the first generation, Spanish-Irish. And so that really set the focus for the rest of my life. We had a phrase when I was young, in our community, that one serves oneself best by serving others first. And that stood me in pretty good stead the rest of my life, because it was always a question of community, where if you were doing well \u2014 and I mean \u201Cwell\u201D by you were living an honest life \u2014 you were a part of community. And when you were not, you had drifted from that community. So I drifted kind of in and out. But as a boy, the staples of my life were my family, my church, and school. And they were all integrated. They \u2014 you couldn\u2019t separate one from the other. My teachers were as much my family as my blood relatives. When I look at the trajectory of your life and the story of your \u2014 I\u2019d say the development of your social and your spiritual conscience across adulthood, it\u2019s very much a kind of classic story of \u2014 there was hardship, but how hardship often leads to what are gifts, and that it\u2019s not so much what you are given but how you take it in and work with it. You\u2019ve said somewhere that caddying was where your social conscience began to be formed. Can you say some more about that? Very clear. And I guess that was a job you had to take, because you all had to work to keep the family going. Yeah, we did. I started caddying \u2014 I hate to admit this, because I\u2019m going to reveal my age, but I started caddying in 1949, at a private country club. And yeah, those were very formative years. I spent my whole boyhood \u2014 well, at least every summer, early spring to late fall \u2014 at the golf course, caddying for a lot of very over-privileged people, mostly the men. But I\u2019m very grateful to them, because in large measure they taught me what not to be. And it just became a matter of course that they \u2014 you were a servant. And they rarely saw you, saw you as a person, and so they would tell stories in front of you and talk about each other, and you were kind of a fly on the tree on the golf course, as it were, or a bumble bee. But you got a sense of these people. A few exceptions, but most of them were over-privileged and unaware, and so they were not our inspiration. And then it\u2019s so interesting to me that you say you had a movie habit early on, and the expectation in your life was that you would do some kind of manual labor, but you couldn\u2019t do that because you had had this forceps injury at birth. Yeah, I had an injury. I mean I wonder if that movie career would even have been a path you\u2019d walked into. Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, because I never really had a consciousness about what I wanted to do. And yet, I knew \u2014 and I think all children know, at a very, very young age, something about themselves, deeply personal, that is almost impossible to communicate with any understanding to anyone else. But I had this, as well, and I started going to movies \u2014 I guess I was around five or six. And gradually it dawned on me that I was like one of those people I was looking at on the screen. And it was a revelation, and it was \u2014 a great sense of peace overcame me as a child, because I knew that it was possible \u2014 that I could do that. In fact, it was more than that I could do that. It was that I was that already. An actor. I just sort of embraced that. Yeah, I knew it. And it was like, \u201COh, that\u2019s what I am. Oh, fine.\u201D I was worried about this business deep inside of me that I could not communicate. \u201COh, that\u2019s what it is. Fine. All right, well\u2026\u201D And I just sort of waited until I was old enough to pursue it. And I did. And then, I think, you \u2014 like a lot of people, you weren\u2019t \u2014 you became less religious, or less overtly religious, as you left home and ventured out in your career. Is that right? I mean it just wasn\u2019t \u2014 it stopped being \u2014 Yeah, very much so. I mean this is what your passion was. Yeah, for sure. It was interesting to me that you discovered the Catholic Worker in New York, but I sense it was not so much as a devout Catholic but as a starving actor. No. Exactly, yeah. I was working at the American Express Company as a stock boy down on lower Broadway in Manhattan, and I got fired just a few weeks before Christmas. And then, a week or so later, I got hired at The Living Theatre by Julian Beck and Judith Malina, who were two of my first teachers, really. They were extremely involved in social justice work and in political radicalism. They were the first ban-the-bombers and Women Strike for Peace. And gosh, they were just a great source of inspiration to me. And I started at the theater as a curtain puller and a general understudy, and they didn\u2019t have a lot of money. In fact, I was paid five dollars a week. This was in 1959. But I was worth every penny. At any rate, they said, \u201CLook, we know you can\u2019t live on this, but we have a friend who has a soup kitchen nearby. And you go down there, and you don\u2019t have to pay anything, and you just wait on line, and they\u2019ll feed you five nights a week.\u201D And it was the Catholic Worker. And was that friend of theirs Dorothy Day, or was it someone else? Yes, the friend was Dorothy Day. She had done some prison time with Judith Malina. They were very close friends. In fact, each one of them wrote about the other in their autobiographies. They did 30 days together for protesting nuclearism, and that was the national religion at the time. It\u2019s so interesting. But yeah, and so I started going there. For months and months I went there. I had no idea \u2014 I could\u2019ve met Dorothy Day, but I couldn\u2019t tell you, because I wasn\u2019t there for any other reason but to satisfy my hunger. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with Martin Sheen. His breakthrough role came in Terrence Malick\u2019s Badlands. Then, while filming his starring role in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Apocalypse Now in the Philippines in 1977, he experienced a health breakdown and an existential crisis. This continued as he traveled to India to work on the film Gandhi. It\u2019s interesting to me how your film projects and your acting projects, they also \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that they converge with where you are personally, or maybe it\u2019s this thing of not choosing your life but living it. It seems like you are working with whatever your life experience is, and for you, that life experience included these film projects and these dramatic roles, which took you kind of out of yourself, or to a larger place. Yeah, I\u2019ve often said that if I knew, going in, what awaited me on Apocalypse, I would have passed. Really? But since I went through that experience, I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, because it brought me to myself in ways that maybe nothing else could have at the time. I survived a physical illness, but I didn\u2019t know if I could\u2019ve survived a spiritual crisis. And that made it real clear how much was at stake. So between Apocalypse and Gandhi, there were about four years. And they were years of reflection and alcohol abuse and insecurity and anger and resentment and a near breakup with my family. But I was searching for that elusive thing that all of us search for. Most of the time, we\u2019re not even conscious of it. But we\u2019re searching for ourselves in an authentic way. We want to recognize the person we see in the mirror and embrace that person with all the brokenness and lackluster, all the things that only we are aware of in the depths of our being. And that\u2019s what I was offered an opportunity to deal with when I finally arrived in India, in 1981, to do this part in Gandhi. I was only there about five or six weeks. And my son Emilio accompanied me. And that was the turning point, because I saw a poverty very up-close and personal that I could not have imagined, and it really went to the center of my being and took me out of myself. And that\u2019s what changed my life. Right. So there\u2019d been that inward journey and that inward reckoning. And then this also took you back out again, and those things came together, it seems. Yeah, I came home from India really shaken. And I remember bringing some books on Indian philosophy and Hinduism and nonviolence, and all of the energy that was mine to absorb during that period. And as soon as I got home, I had to go straightaway to Paris. And while I was in Paris, during that very, very sensitive period, I ran into an old and very dear friend who became my mentor, really, and that was Terrence Malick, who was living in Paris, very underground. He was on the same kind of journey, I guess, I was. But he saw in me this struggle, and he, I guess, for lack of a better term, became for me a spiritual advisor. And he gave you The Brothers Karamazov? Yes, he would give me material along the way, say, \u201CWell, Martin, I think you\u2019re ready for this.\u201D And he\u2019d give me material, we\u2019d talk about that, and then he\u2019d give me another book. And the final step, I guess, in my journey was The Brothers Karamazov. And that did it. It got me in ways that I could not have imagined. I stayed up nights. It took me a week to read it. It was over 1,000 pages. And then I finished it on \u2014 I mean I remember very specifically \u2014 May Day in Europe is a big celebration; it\u2019s like our Labor Day, and I had off from work that day. I\u2019d finished it the night before, and I knew that I had to respond to this need within me that was now at a very critical crossroads. And that is: All right, where do you go from here? And I walked \u2014 I was living in the Left Bank at that time, and I walked over to this little Catholic church. It\u2019s the only English-speaking church in all of France, I discovered later, and it was the church where Oscar Wilde converted. And I learned that later. I said, \u201CWell, I think I came to the right place.\u201D And I came back to Catholicism. And it was the single most joyful moment of my life, because I knew that I had come home to myself. In deeply personal ways, this satisfaction has lasted all these years. I\u2019m still on the honeymoon. [laughs] Go figure. It\u2019s beautiful. I wonder\u2026 But see, I didn\u2019t come back \u2014 I was afraid to come back to the piety of my youth. I wanted the sacraments. I wanted the community. But I didn\u2019t want to feel like I was under a microscope and that God was watching me and looking for me to make a mistake \u201Cand now I gotcha!\u201D you know? It had to be an active spirituality. I want to keep going on that; I just want to ask you a couple questions before we do that. One is, I just \u2014 so just imagine, people who are listening to this may not have ever read The Brothers Karamazov or may have read it 20 or 30 years ago in college. I mean it\u2019s a great novel \u2014 Oh, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you want your life changed. Say a little \u2014 I mean it\u2019s a great novel that weaves into the great debates of his age about God and free will and morality. But could you just say a little bit about what was it in that book that galvanized you? It\u2019s about the reality of commitment. It\u2019s about knowing that you are living an honest life and knowing when you are not, basically. And it\u2019s about family. It\u2019s done within family and community. And it\u2019s not something that you can easily shake. It\u2019s not a work that you can put down and pick up something else and not reflect. You\u2019ll find yourself going back to it again and again and again. It was Dorothy Day\u2019s favorite book, as well. I didn\u2019t know that. And she read it \u2014 she would reread it and talk about it and write about it, yeah. Dostoyevsky had a grip on the reality of life as it is. And he was a habitual gambler; he was not a celebrated man, in many respects. But he longed to live an honest and free life, because that\u2019s really where we find the presence of God or the One, the Other, whatever we express as a higher power \u2014 that we are part of a community. And that work, Dostoyevsky\u2019s work, specifically in that book, is about being a part of community and not being able to let it go without a severe penalty. And I think that points at something, a dynamic that I sense, which is \u2014 on the one hand, you\u2019re talking about this call to activism, which you followed after that. But also there\u2019s the inner work, and those two things go together. And \u201Clove\u201D is a word you use when you talk about that conversion, that experience you had. Yeah, the love that I longed for and, I think, all of us really long for, is knowing that we are loved \u2014 a knowingness about our being that unites us to all of humanity, to all of the universe; that despite ourselves, we are loved. And when you realize that, and you embrace that, you begin to look at everyone else, and you can see very clearly who in your vision knows they\u2019re loved, and who does not. And that makes all the difference. And I began to give thanks and praise for that love. You know how so often people say they go on this journey \u2014 and I said it too, that I\u2019m looking for God. But God has already found us, really. We have to look in the spot where we\u2019re least likely to look. And that is within ourselves. And when we find that love, that presence, deep within our own personal being \u2014 and it\u2019s not something that you can earn or something that you can work towards, it\u2019s just a realization of being human, of being alive, of being conscious. And that love is overwhelming. And that is the basic foundation of joy. And we become enviable joyful. And then we see it in others, and we seek to ignite that love in others. You can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t force someone to realize they\u2019re loved, but you can show them. And most of the effort we make is just by living our lives, by being compassionate and loving and respectful and being a vassal of service for others. That\u2019s what feeds that love. It\u2019s like giving back. But just that embrace, I sometimes \u2014 it is so overwhelming, at times, this reality of loving because one is loved \u2014 that it just brings you up short. You just sit and stare, sometimes, into a vacuum and say, \u201CWhere did this come from? And why is it so clear, and why is it so simple and so powerful?\u201D And one of the great mysteries that I experience at mass is the reception at communion. How do we embrace that? How can we possibly consciously understand what that is? And I don\u2019t have a clue. I just stand on line and say, \u201CI\u2019m Ram\u00F3n, called Martin, your friend. You\u2019re welcome here. And I\u2019m with them.\u201D Whoever the crowd is I\u2019m getting on line with, you just look at the people who are on that line, that community. That is the greatest and simplest expression of overtly trying to explain this mystery I\u2019m talking about, because it is a mystery. It is probably the most profound mystery in all of the universe, this love. Sometimes I\u2019m overwhelmed just watching people on line to embrace that sacrament. It is the most profound thing. I never, ever can get over it. It\u2019s just something you have to surrender to. And just saying, \u201CYeah, I\u2019m with them,\u201D that\u2019s the community of saints. And that\u2019s the basis of \u2014 and that embeddedness in that sense of love and that sense of belonging, that sense of community is then the foundation from which you got very engaged in the world in a different way. And also, I\u2019m so interested in \u2014 Yeah, it\u2019s experiencing true personal joy. OK. And working on hard things, right? I mean also experiencing joy and fighting against injustice. Absolutely, yeah, that\u2019s it. I couldn\u2019t do it if I \u2014 all the demonstrations I\u2019ve ever been on have been nurtured and inspired and performed in this arena of joy. And so when I would go to a demonstration, no matter what the issue or the cause, it would always be prayerful and joyful. I would never take it personal with the guards or the police or whoever I was being arrested by. In fact, I remember my first arrest with Dan Berrigan in New York \u2014 we were protesting nuclearism. And he was a Jesuit priest and became well known as a Vietnam war protester in particular. Yes. He went to prison. He burned draft files at Catonsville, Maryland and went to federal prison with his brother, Philip, for several years for opposing the war in Vietnam. He was the greatest source of inspiration for me when I came back. He was underground after he was found guilty, and he stayed underground for months, and every now and then he would surface to a peace group or a community. And once he was asked, by someone in one of these groups, \u201COh, yeah, Father Berrigan, it\u2019s all well and good for you to protest the war in Vietnam and to choose to go to prison. You don\u2019t have any children. What\u2019s going to happen to us? What\u2019s going to happen to our children if we go to prison?\u201D And Daniel Berrigan responded, \u201CWhat\u2019s going to happen to them if you do not?\u201D That\u2019s the kind of inspiration that I had to embrace. Yeah, Dan Berrigan changed my life. I\u2019ve often said that Mother Teresa drove me back to Catholicism, but Daniel Berrigan keeps me there. You can listen again and share this conversation with Martin Sheen through our website, onbeing.org.\u00A0I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the actor Martin Sheen. Born Ram\u00F3n Est\u00E9vez to Irish-Spanish immigrants, his deep Catholic spirituality and his social justice passion have been at the center of his life, both on-screen and off. While taking part in actions, ranging from the Farm Worker movement of C\u00E9sar Ch\u00E1vez to protests against nuclear weapons and war, Martin Sheen has been arrested over 60 times. I did not know this about you until I kind of got into this preparation for this conversation. You got arrested a lot, protesting the wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua. I mean at one point, you said, you got arrested every Wednesday morning. Was that in L.A., or where was that? Yeah, we had the Wednesday Morning Coalition at the Federal Building. We would meet at La Placita every Wednesday morning with this coalition that included priests and rabbis and people from all over the community. It was \u2014 all these guys led these things. And we would block the courthouse entrance, protesting the war in El Salvador, and we\u2019d be arrested. And I had a backup \u2014 I had like 13 arrests at one time, before I got a court date. And it\u2019s federal, because it\u2019s a federal building, so you come before a federal judge. And she said \u2014 well, because I\u2019m always arrested under my real name, Ram\u00F3n; I have no ID as Martin \u2014 so she said, \u201CRam\u00F3n, it doesn\u2019t seem \u2014 if I put you in jail, it isn\u2019t going to make any difference. You\u2019re going to continue. You\u2019re hell-bent on this protest, aren\u2019t you?\u201D I said, \u201CI\u2019m afraid so, your honor.\u201D She said, \u201CWell, will you do community service?\u201D \u201CI will,\u201D I said. And she sent me to the Bread & Roses homeless caf\u00E9 in Venice. And I was there for ten years. And that was Sister Rose Harrington, right? Sister Rose founded it. Another one of your saint comrades. One of my \u2014 God rest her, yeah, another one of my heroes. She founded this unique homeless kitchen where they served at tables with flowers. And you had to have a reservation, because that told us how many to expect, but it also was a great source of dignity for our guests. She said, \u201CWe call everyone Mr. and Miss or Mrs., and they are our guests. And they\u2019re the only reason we\u2019re here. And we treat them with respect and dignity.\u201D And I did, and that was the longest job I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Yeah, ten years. In fact, I only had to leave to go and do \u2014 I had to leave to go and do The West Wing. So \u2014 obviously, no one with your kind of criminal record could ever have been elected president. No, thank God. But I did love it that in those years \u2014 what did you say \u2014 did you have a business card? Or you presented yourself sometimes \u2014 what, it was \u201Cthe acting president of The West Wing.\u201D \u201CThe acting president of the United States,\u201D yes, yes. A friend of mine, Matt Clark, came up with that, and I kind of \u2014 I liked that a lot. So that was from 1999 to 2006, seven seasons. Yes, it was, yeah. It was one of the best of times. It really was, yeah. It was a great experience, both professionally and personally and spiritually. And I only asked two things of the production when I got the part: Could the president be Catholic, and could he have a Notre Dame degree? Really? And they gave me both, yeah. I wanted him to be Catholic so that I could personally relate to every issue in a moral frame of reference. And I wanted Bartlet to do that, even with the death penalty and with issues of war and peace, all of it. I wanted him to be known to be a practicing Catholic, and he dealt with things in a moral frame of reference. I was inspired by that with Jimmy Carter. Oh, OK. That\u2019s interesting. In fact, he was one of the inspirations for the character of Bartlet. It was Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and John Kennedy. OK. Not bad. Not bad source of inspiration. Yeah, and that you insisted on being Catholic. That\u2019s interesting. I mean I went back and watched the pilot, and I think it\u2019s 18 minutes in, the White House Chief of Staff \u2014 you have not appeared yet. No, I don\u2019t appear until the last scene. But the White House Chief of Staff, he says, \u201CThis president is a deeply religious man.\u201D Oh, I don\u2019t remember that line, but yeah. So I mean there it was. Your wish was represented from that very beginning. But a deeply religious, deeply Catholic, and also deeply politically progressive man, which \u2014 it\u2019s certainly a huge tradition and lineage in Catholicism, right, as we\u2019ve been discussing, but it\u2019s not necessarily the kind of Catholic that\u2019s made the news in politics in the last couple of decades, which is interesting. Yeah, it\u2019s true. I would say I was less religious and more, at least in a personal effort, towards spirituality. It\u2019s hard to be defined by a religion and to shake that kind of mantle, whatever the religion is. I think that what is more unifying \u2014 because unfortunately, religions so divide us these days, more and more. But spirituality unites us, because it\u2019s about our humanity. And that\u2019s where I think we really have to come together. We\u2019re in Advent now, and one of my favorite Advent quotes is from Thomas Merton. I have it pinned up on my wall at home. It was a Christmas card from Daniel Berrigan, and it had this quote. May I give it to you? Yes, please. This is Advent. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. This is Thomas Merton on a Christmas card: \u201CInto this world, this demented inn, where there was absolutely no room for him at all, Christ comes uninvited.\u201D That\u2019s Christmas. Right. You talk about religion or spirituality or keeping Christ in Christmas? Who wants to deal with that? I love that phrase. That quote is my favorite Merton quote. I like that. \u201CInto this demented inn.\u201D But Christ comes, God comes to us uninvited. We\u2019re not out there looking, waiting for him. We think we are. I have another phrase I use so often when I\u2019m faced with having to do something that I know I have to do, and yet I want to put it off, procrastinate a bit. It\u2019s: \u201CWe must accept the cup as offered, not altered.\u201D And so we always want \u2014 \u201CCould you pour some out, please? It\u2019s so full.\u201D Or \u201CCould you put a little sugar in there, please?\u201D Or \u201CMaybe not today; can I take some tomorrow?\u201D No, no, afraid not. We have to accept it as it\u2019s offered. And so that\u2019s what I think the full embracing of spirituality is really about. It\u2019s about a consciousness that is not always expressed in religion, but it is in our humanity. One thing that I wondered if \u2014 I just want to ask you a question, if I may. How \u2014 may I? Yes, absolutely. One of the things I wanted to talk to you a little bit about, if you don\u2019t mind, is this business of prayer. Do you ask people, in your interviews, if they pray or how they pray or what they pray, or what does prayer mean to them? Have you ever gone into that area? It certainly comes up, but it\u2019s not a question I would just ask somebody out of the blue, because it\u2019s the most intimate question, right? Yes, it is. Yeah. This is the most curious element of the spiritual life. I\u2019m always curious about how people pray and what images they use to go to that place where they can pray. And what does prayer mean to them? What do they expect? Is it something across your life that has \u2014 do you feel that prayer has changed a lot? Yeah, one of the most curious questions in the New Testament is the friends of Jesus saying, \u201CTeach us how to pray.\u201D And he gives them the Our Father. That\u2019s the only prayer that really comes to us from the master. And how interesting that those men at that time, or at least the people in his community, asked him how to pray. That they were devout Jews, and they had a very structured form of prayer and worship and sacrifice, and that they asked him, \u201CTeach us how to pray,\u201D is a very curious question to me, that they wanted to go deeper. They wanted to go more personal, I guess. Most of us, you know, will pray when something \u2014 we\u2019re in the form of a crisis or we want something or we feel we need something. I saw an interesting thing the other day in the paper. Somebody \u2014 one of the candidates was asked where God was when 9/11 happened. And he said, \u201CWell, there\u2019s good and there\u2019s evil in the world, and we have to be aware of that.\u201D Well, my response to that would have been that God was in the towers. God was present to each individual going through that horrible \u2014 facing their own death, individually and with a community. That God is present in our deepest hungers, in our worst times as well as our best, but we often are forced to pray in ways that we can never articulate, in bad times. How often the expression is \u201COh, my God,\u201D when we see something good or evil. The expression is the same. \u201COh, my God,\u201D you know? So I\u2019m just curious about that. So can I ask how you \u2014 how prayer works for you, and has that changed across your lifetime? Is it different now than it was 20 years ago? Oh, yeah, it changes almost daily. I feel it\u2019s the one time where I am commanded to use my imagination, because that, I think, is where it starts, isn\u2019t it, is with the imagination. So what do you imagine? What are you seeing? What are you feeling? What are you driving towards? Where are you during that period of prayer? That\u2019s the thing that fascinates me. For me, the central energy of it, I guess, is at communion, at the Eucharist. And for the most part, I\u2019m just so stunned and so joy-filled that for the most part I just say, \u201CThank you. Thank you for your presence. Thank you, thank you.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with actor Martin Sheen. In the summer of 2003, he traced part of the legendary pilgrimage route, the Camino de Santiago, and later starred in a film about it, The Way, which was written and directed by his son, Emilio, and co-produced by Janet, his wife of over 50 years. So let\u2019s talk about The Way and the pilgrimage, because you\u2019ve also said \u2014 one of the ways you describe who is Martin Sheen, who is Ram\u00F3n Est\u00E9vez \u2014 you are a pilgrim. Now, the road to Santiago de Compostela is this famous pilgrimage and 1,000 \u2014 no, what is it \u2014 800 kilometers. It\u2019s 800 kilometers. It\u2019s 500 miles, yeah, and it\u2019s 1,000 years old, and blah, blah, blah. My father was a Gallego. He was born not too far, about 70 kilometers from Santiago. He was from Vigo. But it is interesting that it was also a pilgrimage into your family roots, I mean back into both of your names, Martin and Ram\u00F3n. Yes, it was. Yeah. No one had ever been given permission to film inside the cathedral in Santiago. Oh, I didn\u2019t know that. Only newsreel footage and documentaries. They never allowed a production company in there to actually film a drama. But we prevailed upon them and said we were very respectful and we were Spanish and we were Catholic and we wanted to celebrate this. And so they let us in. They lit the cathedral for us and let us film the mass and the Botafumeiro, the huge incense burner that flies across, from ceiling to ceiling. But pilgrimage, although it\u2019s a physical endeavor, for the most part it\u2019s an interior pilgrimage. It\u2019s an interior journey. And all the pilgrims who\u2019ve ever done it have come to that realization. You\u2019re walking, physically \u2014 that\u2019s something you\u2019re doing outside, but there\u2019s something else going on inside. And it\u2019s the journey to your true self, I think we begin to realize, because we\u2019re quiet and focused in a way that we normally are not. So you get six, eight, ten weeks on pilgrimage to learn about yourself and to celebrate your life. Well, this is so wonderful. I just want to ask you a couple more questions. Sure. I actually want to go back a little bit to The West Wing. You said that it was such an incredible experience personally, professionally, and spiritually. How would you talk about, for you, how that was spiritually significant, playing that role and being part of that series? Well, what we do for a living \u2014 that is, artists \u2014 is, we live on the energy of our imagination. Our imagination projects us to fulfill our work. And it is the one sure measure of authenticity, is to use your imagination to explore realities. And so working as an actor on The West Wing, reflecting the most powerful office in the world, it seemed to me the most important thing was to project the humanity of that office and that whoever occupied it had a responsibility to be more human than anyone else around him, and to trust the instinct of your humanness, to embrace all of the brokenness and the insecurities and the fear and anxiety and to trust in something higher, that as long as you were doing your best to be honest and forthright that you would come out on even ground. And I trusted that, as an actor. And I discovered very early on that if I used different language than what had been written by Aaron Sorkin, I felt it was more realistic \u2014 \u201CWell, I\u2019m more Martin. Martin would say this.\u201D And he goes, \u201CYeah, well, OK.\u201D And it took me a while to embrace that. And when I finally did and got out of his way with the language, I realized that it was not Martin, it was Bartlet. There was a scene one time, he actually \u2014 I thought it was a mistake, but in the script he had me literally banging my head on the desk in the Oval Office. And I said, \u201CI can\u2019t do this, Aaron. I\u2019m sure you made a mistake.\u201D He said, \u201CNo, if you do it, you\u2019ll see.\u201D And just like all imaginative artists, I was ruled by him, and I did it, and it was the only thing that I could do in the scene that reflected how the president felt at that moment. I actually wondered how you felt about lighting up a cigarette in a church. Oh, my, my. That was not easy, because\u2026 No? That\u2019s the National Cathedral. And when we filmed that in the National Cathedral, I was very reluctant to do that. But it was only when I did it that I understood how important it was. Here was a man who was facing despair, who was in a dialogue with the Almighty. That takes a pretty good imagination, and a big ego, to pull that off.\u00A0And I remember the curators of the church were very upset about what I did. And between takes I was talking to them, and they said \u201CWe think it\u2019s disgraceful, and it ought not be done.\u201D And I said, \u201CYeah, I appreciate that, and I\u2019m sorry you are subject to this.\u201D And then I looked up, and exactly above my head was a stained glass image, in the window, of Job. And I said, \u201CWhat a coincidence, look at that guy up there. That\u2019s what I am down here, today.\u201D It\u2019s Job crying out to God, \u201CHow could you do this to me? On the other hand\u2026\u201D Right. It was so biblical. It was so ingrained in the Jewish community to have an open dialogue with God. That was a form of prayer. Where is your passion, your curiosity directed right now? Where are you feeling called to this spiritual discipline of human presence in what\u2019s happening in the world now? Well, it\u2019s so clear in the horrible situations in the Mid-East and so many countries, particularly Syria. We\u2019ve watched this horror unravel. There is no Syria. It has become a living hell that people are trying to get out of. It\u2019s just this descent into this level of inhumanity, of this level of insanity. It\u2019s clear to the whole world. We just watch in horror. And more violence creates more violence, and we seem thrown back into despair. Each time we move forward, we face despair. And yet, looking at the lives coming out of that horror, these extraordinary people who risked their lives getting out and then risked their lives trying to cross Europe, trying to get to a safe haven \u2014 and to be subject to so much what I call, basically, vulgarity\u2026 That\u2019s a good word. That they\u2019re being stopped from coming in here or going where they can be safe. I would think that the answer to the horrors that we witnessed recently in Paris would be to open our arms even wider and embrace even more and say, \u201CThis is our answer to this insanity.\u201D So that\u2019s the one overriding issue that I\u2019m immensely concerned about and that I am troubled by. You said somewhere, or wrote, I think, \u201CI don\u2019t know what salvation means in a personal sense. For me, a better word is freedom\u201D \u2014 which I think for you is connected with this idea that you keep bringing home about your core of gratitude and community and love and these things as the basis for your action. I mean, you\u2019re not talking about freedom as autonomy or isolation or mere independence \u2014 I mean, it might have a quality of independence. You\u2019re talking about freedom as connected to community in some way, I think. That\u2019s what I hear coming through. Yes, exactly. So often people get stuck \u2014 and I did, myself \u2014 on the spiritual journey, if you will, with piety. And that is a terrible stumbling block. I have nothing against piety, but I think that piety is the road. It is not the destination. If being pious leads you to a form of personal reflection and acceptance of a higher power, then it has its purpose. But it has to be discarded, in the larger picture, in favor of the community. Because piety is something that you do, or you tend to do, alone. And true freedom, spirituality, can only be achieved in community, even if the community is only imagined.\u00A0I mean someone living in a cell by themselves, alone, in repression, in the darkest of times: still, they are in community. That\u2019s the wonderful thing, that image that Catholicism uses and refers to as the communion of saints, that even after we are gone, we are still a part of something that\u2019s very much alive and we respond to. And our church is \u2014 thank heaven for this extraordinary man, Francis, who is teaching us that our church has to be less a museum for saints than it should be a hospital for sinners. OK. But that\u2019s \u2014 I love the community of saints \u2014 and sinners. You can\u2019t really separate them. You can\u2019t identify one without the other, which is wonderful, because that\u2019s community. But I feel a part of a community even when I\u2019m distanced from it. The greatest mysteries are the simplest ones. Those are the ones that we confront every day. I had a conversation once with a priest. I was traveling and went to confession in this very remote place. And this guy was wonderful, and we were having a theological conversation in the confessional. And suddenly, he said, \u201CWell, we don\u2019t know what God is, do we?\u201D And he said it as if \u2014 \u201CWell, you know, maybe I ran into someone who did. I\u2019m not going to foreclose that possibility.\u201D Right. And? What it says is, every time we try to identify God, we are sure to identify what he is certainly \u2014 what she is certainly not. So we don\u2019t know what God is. And the genius of God, to dwell where we would least likely look, within the depths of our own being, our own shallowness, our own darkness, our own humanity \u2014 that\u2019s the genius of God. Well, Martin Sheen, Ram\u00F3n Est\u00E9vez, thank you so much for this beautiful conversation. It\u2019s been wonderful to meet you. Thank you very much. Now you know what a windbag I am.
