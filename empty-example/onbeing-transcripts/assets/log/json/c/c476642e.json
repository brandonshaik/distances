  "fullText": "Beginning to talk, acquiring language, is one of the most ordinary and remarkable things human beings do. By the age of three or four, children typically have vocabularies in the thousands of words and a grasp of complex grammar. In fact, as my guest Jean Berko Gleason was one of the first to confirm, young children know grammatical forms that no one ever tries to teach them; and they say things they\u2019ve never heard anyone say before. She is a pioneer in psycholinguistics \u2014 in understanding how language emerges from childhood on; and what it says about how we think and who we are. And she\u2019s maintained an exuberant and playful spirit to match her youngest research subjects. This hour, she shares what we keep learning about the human gift, as she puts it, to be conscious of ourselves and to comment on that. Jean Berko Gleason sees this as a frontier every bit as important and thrilling as exploring outer space or the deep sea. We are innately predisposed to pay attention to little children and to talk to them. Let\u2019s not just assume that we are scientists sitting around watching babies unfold. We\u2019re unfolding with them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Jean Berko Gleason is Professor Emerita of psychology at Boston University. I interviewed her in 2011. She made her mark on linguistics in 1958 when she published the \u201CWug Test.\u201D This was, and still is, performed on children, using a simply drawn mythical creature of her devising. \u201CJean\u2019s Wug Test,\u201D as one admiring linguistics student describes it, \u201Cwas the first to prove that young children analyze the words around them with innate mental structures and, as if by magic, find complicated rules in this chaotic mess \u2014 and actually understand them! This was one of those monumental discoveries that laid the foundation for the modern study of linguistics.\u201D Jean Berko Gleason\u2019s own parents were immigrants from Transylvania. And though she never learned their mother tongue of Hungarian, she was an avid and gifted polyglot from an early age. As I look at your background, it seems clear that you didn\u2019t know from childhood that you would be a linguist but that you were always fascinated with languages. And I wonder \u2026 Absolutely. Do you know where that came from? Was that planted somewhere in your family? Actually, there\u2019s probably a part of my family that has to do with it. One, I think some people are just interested in language. I mean, I just happened to find it easy to talk all kinds of languages and I find it amusing, and I just love them. But I think there was a personal thing in my life as well, which is that I had an older brother who had cerebral palsy and he was really smart, in fact he ultimately got a Ph.D. from Cornell. And he was a smart, lovely guy. But he had motoric incapacities, such that his speech was extremely difficult to understand. And I was probably the person who really understood him best. So when I was a kid, I was the person who, when my brother Marty had problems saying something, I was the person who knew what he was saying and told everybody. So I guess my early experience as an interpreter had something to do with it, too. That\u2019s really interesting. And then you went to college and you studied literature and history and then you just kind of discovered psycholinguistics \u2014 or linguistics. Yes, rather by happenstance. Psycho \u2014 well \u2026 Was it psycholinguistics by then? It was. Well, it wasn\u2019t called that \u2014 it was called the psychology of language. But I had taken French and Spanish and Arabic and \u2014 no I took Arabic later, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 and Russian and Norwegian. I had taken a lot of languages. But my senior year in college I took a course on the psychology of language taught by a new, young assistant professor who had just come from the University of Michigan. And his name was Roger Brown, and the course blew me away because it really talked about the things that were interesting to me, about how it is that human beings store language in their heads, how you acquire language, what happens when you loose language. And Roger Brown then went on to be somebody who made a major breakthrough in this field, studying Adam and Eve and Sarah? Yes. Were those real names? No, they weren\u2019t, but I think you might be interested to know that although they were made up names, they were real kids. They were kids in the Harvard day care or preschool, whatever it was called in those days. It was a big \u2014 if you know Cambridge, Massachusetts, there\u2019s a psychology building, it\u2019s called William James Hall. And where William James Hall used to be \u2014 where William James Hall is \u2014 there used to be a preschool in a Quonset hut \u2014 a leftover World War II Quonset hut. We used to go there and sit on tiny chairs with great, big tape recorders and record these kids. And what this study did was it sent people, on a monthly basis, to children\u2019s houses and tape-recorded all of the interaction between the child and parents. And then they came back and gave assistants, or us, whoever we were, the tapes. And people transcribed those tapes, typed them out, just like the script of a play. And then a group of graduate students and Roger Brown would sit around the table looking at these transcripts and say, what\u2019s going on here? What are these kids doing? What\u2019s their language? What\u2019s their grammar? What\u2019s their sound system? How do they make a question? We began to really look into what the development of language looked like in a very naturalistic setting. As I started to really steep myself in understanding what you do and what you know, where it took me was \u2014 I ended up learning German as a young adult and becoming fluent in German. Mm-hmm, good \u2014 gut, I mean. Yeah, Sehr gut. Ganz gut. And I had this experience \u2014 one thing that happened then, which I was recalling, was as I really learned the ins and outs of a new language \u2014 and German, of course, is very highly structured, so it was quite intentionally learning the ins and outs. Yes, yes. I became aware that I didn\u2019t know \u2014 at least consciously know \u2014 much of that about my mother tongue, that I wouldn\u2019t possibly be able to explain to someone else how I constructed a sentence in English the way I construct a sentence in German. And this took me also \u2014 I sense this excitement in your writing and in all the writing in your field about just how amazing it is that we learn language and inhabit it starting so young in lives. Well, it is remarkable, but the real appreciation of what we\u2019re doing didn\u2019t come until basically this century. That is in the past people were interested in language and in how kids acquired language. Charles Darwin wrote notebooks about one of his sons, and he outlined how the kid acquired language, in some sense, but not in the sort of \u2014 what you might say, componential way that we now understand. Because now we understand that language is made of a bunch of subsystems \u2014 a sound system, a meaning system, a syntactic system that allows you to make sentences \u2014 and we know how those are structured in the languages we study. So now we can have the linguist describe the language. You\u2019re quite right \u2014 if you ask a speaker, what are the sounds of English? What they\u2019re going to tell you is the vowels A, E, I, O, and U \u2014 they will name the alphabet letters, but they won\u2019t really know what the sounds of English are. And they won\u2019t know which ones are the important ones, in some sense. And so what I learned from you is that children start to acquire these things, as well as thousands of vocabulary words and rules and systems by the time they are three or four, and that children do this in every known society, whether it\u2019s literate or not, in every language. Absolutely. In fact, literacy, written language, is a very late acquisition in terms of human evolution. Human beings have been speaking for hundreds of thousands of years, maybe a million years. Nobody really knows, because how are you going to reconstruct whether or not a particular group of people spoke? But it\u2019s part of our ancient, ancient heritage as humans. Spoken language is the basis from which such things as written language stem. So, I want to talk about something that was a big contribution of yours, the Wug Test. Ah, yes. Again, in this realm of what we take for granted and don\u2019t think hard enough about \u2014 the fact that children know grammatical forms that nobody has ever really tried to teach them, that young children say things they\u2019ve never heard anyone say before. And your test was kind of demonstrating that. It did, it did. The test showed that even very, very little kids \u2014 namely, children of three \u2014 are able to make plurals of words they\u2019ve never heard before, and past tenses of verbs they\u2019ve never heard before, and a lot of other forms in the language in a creative way they\u2019ve never heard before. The classic example is the wug itself, right? Mm-hmm. The wug is a little creature, it looks like a little birdie. Rule one is \u201Cget their attention,\u201D as they use to say. And you got to create a mythical creature, I mean, that\u2019s fun. I did get to create a mythical creature who has been around for so long it would be embarrassing to tell you. But what I showed \u2014 let\u2019s give the example of the wug. I drew a little picture of little wug, and then there were two. So I say to kids, \u201CThis is a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two\u2026\u201D And even little, bitty kids say, \u201CTwo wugs.\u201D Even little three year olds, four year olds, five year olds, without a problem, fill in that \u201Czuh\u201D sound. We had to use nonsense words, because if we used regular words you could just say, \u201CWell, they memorized it.\u201D Say, \u201CHere\u2019s a dog. Now there is another one. There are two.\u201D And kids say, \u201CTwo dogs.\u201D It only proves they\u2019ve heard somebody say, \u201CTwo dogs.\u201D But if they say, \u201CTwo wugs\u201D \u2014 and the plural in English is made the regular plural, never mind children and \u201Coxen,\u201D and \u201Cbrethren,\u201D and things like that. The regular plural in English has three different forms, depending on the stem of the word that it\u2019s going to be added to. Now, what we found was that kids acquire these different forms of the plural in a different order. So that it builds, that complexity builds. Well, it builds, but what\u2019s remarkable about it is that it builds in such a regular way. It isn\u2019t that kids learn language in bits and pieces, and every kid does it a different way. Children have their own ways of learning. Children have their own styles, they have their own temperaments. But when it comes to the acquisition of language as a system, the children abstract the rules \u2014 if I can say it that way, and I hesitate to say it that way \u2014 but they abstract the rules of the language in very much the same order. That is, children speaking English acquire English in very much the same order, whoever they are and wherever they are. That is a remarkable sort of universal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with psycholinguist Jean Berko Gleason. So this observation gave rise to linguistics\u2019 and psycholinguistics\u2019 own version of the \u201Cnature versus nurture\u201D debate, you might say? Well, there is one out there, and there has been an enduring one out there. But we talked about children having rules \u2014 this is why I was hesitant to talk about abstraction and things. See, we could describe what children do. We can say, \u201COK. Look. They make the plural, then they do this and they do that.\u201D But then you can say, this is what they do. How do they do it, or why do they do it? Those are different questions. On the one side, you\u2019ve got people who believe that much of language is innate, it\u2019s hardwired into your head. When you are born, you have the principles of grammar in place, all those things. You have a language acquisition device. On the other end of the spectrum, you have other good friends of mine who are of a much more behaviorist view, who say, \u201CWell, you have learning principles, and parents spend a huge amount of time with children, and they are basically helping to shape their language by reinforcing good attempts, by ignoring bad attempts, by modeling, by many different kinds of learning activities.\u201D In the middle, you\u2019ve got the interactionist world, and that\u2019s where most of us are now. And the interactionist people are saying, look, you have a capacity. What I would say is your brain is not formed when you\u2019re born. You have to build your brain. Look at what happened to the children in Romania who were taken well care of in nurseries or in orphanages. People fed them, they gave them clothing, they didn\u2019t talk to them. Those children\u2019s brains did not develop. Your brain develops through interaction with other people. And are they \u2014 do they have serious language issues? Oh, please, they have serious every issue. They are seriously compromised human beings. They have terrible, terrible problems if you don\u2019t have those critical experiences. So we think \u2014 or I think, and a lot of people of my bent think\u00A0\u2014 that language develops through interaction with other people talking to you, and that it is not through mere exposure to the language. In other words, you could believe, oh, you\u2019ve got the principles \u2014 sort of what you said to begin with \u2014 if you\u2019ve got the principles, they\u2019re innate, you just have to hear the language, set the parameters, and away you go. Well, the thought experiment that I would propose for that is, if you really think that, take your child and set her in front of the, I don\u2019t know, the Chukchi or the Korean cable news every morning. At the end of a year tell me\u2026 Will they start speaking Korean? \u2026tell me how much Chukchi that child can speak. And you know what the answer is going to be. It\u2019s going to be none. Because children don\u2019t learn that way. That is not how you acquire language. This is my belief, all right? It\u2019s not just a belief, it\u2019s from everything I have seen with what happens with children and parents. And there are \u2014 of course, a fellow at MIT now \u2014 I suppose you have seen the work of Deb Roy at MIT. He\u2019s not a linguist, he\u2019s an engineer who has collected 350,000 hours of data on his child growing up \u2026 Oh, this \u2014 this is the child project? Yeah, it was a project at MIT. You can see he gave a TED lecture on it. And if listeners are interested, there\u2019s a wonderful TED lecture that you can see describing how his little boy acquired individual words. And you can just see the child going from \u201Cwat\u201D to \u201Cwater\u201D along the way, but with this tremendous interaction with the people around him. Language development is a cooperative event. It happens between children and the people around them. And I think you need not just the cognitive stuff to understand how to abstract rules, but you also need to have emotional underpinnings. You have to care. Why are you talking? You have to care about other people. And people who don\u2019t care \u2014 one of the problems with kids who have problems like autism is that many of them are disconnected from other people and are thereby much impaired in communicating with other people. And you are saying that that lack of motivation is critical. I think the lack of affect, lack of attachment, all of those things. Yeah, I think that language has many components. Look, language \u2014 how does language begin in kids? It doesn\u2019t begin with a child suddenly looking around and saying, \u201CWow, I\u2019m going to make a subject, a verb and an object.\u201De It begins with communication with the people around that kid. In the first place, as you know, babies are listening to language before they are born. In utero, babies are listening. And we now have technologies that enable us to show that not only are they listening, that if they are hearing two languages, they are beginning to build a bilingual brain before they are born. And they are making preferences so that when they\u2019re \u2014 by the time they\u2019re born, babies prefer to listen to their own mother as against somebody else. So I think in the beginning, language is there so we can say, \u201CMommy, I want you.\u201D And little kids are very good at that. This feels analogous and related to me to the more expansive understanding we are gaining of intelligence in general. That it\u2019s not just a matter of information plugged in. Even the field of artificial intelligence has changed, that robots are more interactive and that that\u2019s how important knowledge, then, is acquired and built. Well, I don\u2019t know robots, but I do know babies. So here\u2019s the thing. A lot of linguists who make theories about how children learn language don\u2019t have children of their own. They haven\u2019t had that experience of seeing what goes on. That was why it was, I think, such a shock to the folks at MIT when Deb Roy came up with this, the engineer. Oh, because he worked with his own child. He was studying his own child. And it\u2019s technology that nobody else can do, obviously, because he\u2019s got hundreds of cameras, mirrors \u2014 his whole house is wired. His whole house is \u2014 it\u2019s just incredible. All right. We\u2019ll wonder about those therapy bills in 20 years. It\u2019s true. But, as you mentioned, and you wrote about \u2014 which is interesting that, 50 years ago, people in linguistics or psycholinguistics often \u2014 or longer than that \u2014 study their own children, that Darwin studied his own children. Yes, yes. And I\u2019ve seen you be very clear, you have three daughters that you did not study on your daughters. Well I got a lot of good ideas from them. Well that\u2019s what I want to ask you. And also, how did the work you were doing, what you were learning, influence the way you spoke with them and interacted with them? Well, I think it\u2019s the other way around. I mean, we \u2014 I think we\u2019ve already established that I\u2019m a verbal kind of person who can\u2019t resist playing with language and everything. I obviously noticed a lot of what they were doing, but I didn\u2019t set up experiments with them. But, for instance, one of my children said something that has become \u2014 that people don\u2019t seem to know she said, because I see people from all spectra of the linguistic world quoting it. One of my kids came home from preschool one day, and she said to me, \u201CMy teacher holded the baby rabbits and I patted them.\u201D And I said, \u201COh, your teacher held the baby rabbits.\u201D And she said, \u201CYes.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat did you say again?\u201D And she said, \u201CShe holded the baby rabbits and we patted them.\u201D And then I said, \u201CWell, did you say she held them tightly?\u201D And she said to me, \u201CNo. She holded them loosely.\u201D So, here I\u2019m thinking, well, I keep saying \u201Cheld,\u201D she keeps saying \u201Cholded.\u201D Anybody who thinks that children acquire language through imitation is making a mistake. I wrote a paper called, \u201CDo Children Imitate?\u201D Just with that as a thought, because then I went out and found lots of kids, and I made a thing like the Wug Test, except it was all irregulars, and I gave the kids the answer. So I said, \u201CHere\u2019s a goose, now there are two geese. What\u2019s this?\u201D \u201CA goose.\u201D \u201CWhat are these?\u201D \u201CTwo geeses \u2014 two gooses,\u201D whatever. They didn\u2019t give me the \u2026 They used the rule that they \u2026 They over-regularized, basically, is what we say. So the point of that paper was that kids will use their own system at the stage where they are. They\u2019re not imitating you. Not that you are not having an effect on them, but they\u2019re not learning language through pure imitation. They are building an internal system. But that \u2014 \u201CMy teacher holded the baby rabbits\u201D ended up as big headers in Psychology Today and in Harvard Magazine, all kinds of things. And I still hear people quoting us. So the same child said \u2014 we had a conversation one time. I was talking about giraffes. And she said, \u201CWhat do giraffes eat?\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, they eat leaves, mostly.\u201D And she said, \u201CAnd what do they eat lessly?\u201D So if you are a linguist you pick up on things like that, and it gives you ideas of how you \u2014 of what\u2019s going on. But what you also see there is that they are really working. They\u2019re putting things together. You see the creativity. You see that they actually have a systematic knowledge. And I think that was the big excitement that \u2014 getting back to what\u2019s good about the Wug Test, aside from the fact that, of course, the wugs are so cute \u2014 I say that because I drew them myself. I did. We were very poor in graduate school. Now, you see people take it to the department of graphics. You didn\u2019t have computer graphics, correct. We didn\u2019t have a department of graphics. We had a pad of paper and a wug to make. I made them on five-by-seven cards, which I bought at the Harvard Coop, and used colored pencils. And that\u2019s the way we did it. But it worked. It worked perfectly well, but anyway. Well \u2026 And getting at the fact that language is about more than language, right? That it\u2019s about more than words or sentences constructed. There\u2019s this phrase that\u2019s all through your writing, in your field, from Stanley Hall, who I guess is the father of developmental psychology. \u201CThe contents of children\u2019s minds.\u201D Yes, \u201CThe contents of children\u2019s minds.\u201D I mean just that phrase, \u201CThe contents of children\u2019s minds.\u201D It\u2019s big. Yes. It\u2019s bigger than we thought. You were right earlier on when you said that we\u2019re coming to understand so much more about intelligence. We understand so much more about babies. There was a time when people thought that babies had no sensation. You do remember that people use to do open-heart surgery on babies under \u2014 without anesthesia, under the impression that babies couldn\u2019t feel anything. They sort of thought they were like blind puppies when they were born, just squirming masses. So, now, as we get more sophisticated in our ways of investigating them, we know more and more about them. But I hate to say that this is true about every other creature, too. So those of us who still eat lobsters, for instance, now have got to worry about the social life of the lobster. So the whole question of sentience, the whole question of having meaningful lives, I think, has spread. It turns out that an awful lot of creatures have complex and meaningful lives. Hmm. That\u2019s a big thought too. That\u2019s \u2026 It is. And it\u2019s one that slows us down a little bit, when you realize \u2014 well, we\u2019re talking about language, but if you start thinking about the things that might not be so good in the country, a lot of it has to do, in my book, with not realizing the sentience of other creatures, and thereby causing great badness out there. At onbeing.org, you can see that hard-working wug and the other sweet, hand-drawn mythical creatures that comprise Jean Berko Gleason\u2019s famous Wug Test. Check them out, and have some fun with them \u2014 take the test with your children. On our website, you can also listen again and find my unedited conversation with Jean Berko Gleason, including her speculation about how different languages shape character and thinking; and her early work with Romani-speaking gypsies in her parents\u2019 native Hungary. She observed that their improbable survival and cohesiveness as a culture had to do with unusually strong linguistic socialization. All that at onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with a living legend in the field of psycholinguistics, Jean Berko Gleason. She created something called the Wug Test as a young scientist, helping to illustrate the remarkable ordinary human capacity to learn language. She\u2019s continued to break new ground in exploring what this may teach us about adults as about the children we\u2019re raising. Jean Berko Gleason has called the exploration of language \u201Ca frontier every bit as important and thrilling as outer space or the deep sea.\u201D I was thinking when I was getting ready to talk to you about a conversation I had with Martin Rees a few months ago, who was a physicist in Britain. And he studies black holes and red dwarfs and stars and the solar system, but categorically says, as those people will say, still the most complex phenomena in the universe by far are living beings. Anything that\u2019s alive. Well, it\u2019s true. And one of the things we\u2019ve been doing in our recent research, as a matter of fact, is trying to look at the linguistic competence of our connection to other living beings. And \u2026 Tell me about that, because I saw you mention that, but tell me what that research is about, what you\u2019re doing. Well, it\u2019s the latest thing I\u2019ve been doing, which began with a paper we wrote called \u201CAlligators All Around.\u201D I think somebody else wrote that first. \u201CThe Acquisition of Animal Terms in English and Russian\u201D is a chapter we wrote in a book, but was based on a paper we gave at a conference. We were looking at children\u2019s early vocabulary, and here\u2019s the thing. When you look at young kids \u2014 here I was telling you, \u201COh, they all do it the same way,\u201D and people can characterize early vocabulary. When you characterize early vocabulary, you say things like, \u201CIt\u2019s in the here and now,\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s things of interest to the child,\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s things around the child.\u201D Two year olds have words. They have words like \u201Cmommy\u201D and \u201Cdaddy\u201D and \u201Cbaby\u201D and \u201Cbook,\u201D and also \u201CTyrannosaurus rex.\u201D For some reason, they have a long \u2014 but nobody noticed this. This was not \u2026 That they learn the names of animals? Well, that they have huge animal vocabularies. So this is what we began to look at. And we began to look at \u2014 just the category of animals. And it really turns out that, well, for both English- and Russian-speaking kids \u2014 because that was the first set we did \u2014 we found little kids whose animal vocabulary has nothing to do with those rules we were talking about. It\u2019s not things around them. It\u2019s not simple to say. It\u2019s not common words. The Russian part \u2014 my colleague Elena Zaretsky finds little Russian kids playing, say, vot krokodil\u2019chik, \u201Clittle crocodilies.\u201D A 14 month old talking to little \u2014 playing\u2026 That is interesting. Well, it\u2019s interesting when you begin to think that it isn\u2019t just the children, it is also we. We have this enormous connection to the living world that is reflected in our language, but in a way that we haven\u2019t been thinking about. At least, I haven\u2019t until recently, and I don\u2019t know anything about it in the language literature. A lot of people are talking about children and animals, and the importance of animals, or how good it is to take a dog to the nursing home, things of that sort. But the point is that we have an enormous connection to the rest of the living world and that we love the living world. We love animals and we love plants. And this is reflected in what we are doing with children. In our field now, we\u2019ve become very high-tech. We have data banks that have transcripts, so I can say, look at all the combinations of words where parents say, \u201CLook at the \u2014 \u201D and pull that out. Pull out every sentence like that, and let\u2019s see what parents tell their children to look at. So we did that recently, and we pulled out over 2,000 utterances from 61 different people. Of the top 30 words \u2014 I believe this is correct \u2014 that parents are calling kids\u2019 attention to, 12 are animals. Animals are really right up there. We\u2019re really \u2014 in fact, the example I gave, because I gave a little talk about this at the World Science Festival. I believe that is what it was called. Anomia hits. It was at the World Science Festival. I showed a picture of that wonderful horse from the caves at Lascaux, and I said, here\u2019s a picture that was drawn 17,500 years ago. It\u2019s pretty clear that an interest in animals has been with us for a long time. Somebody expended a huge amount of time drawing that beautiful horse on that cave wall. So this interest in animals is with us and is \u2014 I think I said, at the World Science Festival, \u201CWhen you take your child for a walk, you say look at the birdie, not look at the traffic cones.\u201D That\u2019s true. OK. You don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s extremely rare for parents to say look at the rock. And I will bet you that our ancient ancestor, when she finished this painting on the wall at Lascaux, 17,500 years ago, turned to her little cave kid and said, \u201CLook at the horsey.\u201D So, how is the new science of the brain changing your field? I don\u2019t know how involved you are with that, but what can be studied, and how it can be studied and \u2026 Oh, it\u2019s incredible. What can be studied is \u2014 I don\u2019t do that. There are wonderful people who do. There are a number of people out on the West Coast, people in Vancouver, who are doing absolutely wonderful things in looking at \u2014 what\u2019s very exciting is that they are beginning to pattern activation in the brain. And now they can do it non-invasively on tiny children. So you can tell where things are happening in the brain. You can tell either by measuring blood flow or by measuring changes in oxygen, but these are all external, and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 people have been using functional MRI for some time, but the problem with functional MRI, if anybody has ever been in one of those machines, it\u2019s like having \u2014 it\u2019s horrible. And you couldn\u2019t put a three year old in there very long. Exactly. No, you\u2019d have to sedate them or something. You have to \u2014 they have to be unconscious. But now they have these little caps they can put on where they are able to measure these changes either in magnetic activity or in blood flow or in oxygen, something of that sort. And they are able to tell where things are happening in the brain. So is there any thing that this is making apparent that\u2019s really changing the equation? Or how is it weighing in to these poles that we talked about, this discussion, nativist or how interactively we learn language, and what that means? Well, it is showing that some of the things we talked about earlier in this conversation have actual physiological correlates. So when I said that you can \u2014 that babies who are hearing two languages in utero are born with a bilingual brain, they actually have brain testing that shows that they have activation for both languages, et cetera. So are the languages in different places? How does \u2026 Oh, I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that. I don\u2019t know and that\u2019s not my field. But all I\u2019m saying is that they are able to show that there is brain activation for both languages so that their brain \u2014 by the time they are born their brain is not the same as a monolingual kid\u2019s brain. You\u2019re building a bilingual brain. That\u2019s really interesting. The other thing is that with this complex technology, they are, indeed, able to show, as we said earlier, that earlier and earlier in a child\u2019s life, that they are able to make distinctions, and they are hearing what\u2019s going on, and their brain is really doing it. But look, that\u2019s neurology, I mean, it is psychoneurology, or it is linguistic neuropsychology, you give it a name, whatever you like. That will go on, but that doesn\u2019t mean that people are going to stop looking at mothers talking to their children. We need every kind of research. What science has to look for is what is called \u201Cconvergent validity.\u201D And that is many different kinds of research will ultimately come in on what is the truth as we know it, or as best we can know it for our era. And there might be things that we don\u2019t know about right now. There may be things that we just don\u2019t know about, or haven\u2019t thought about, or given and paid any attention to. So the brain science is wonderful, but isn\u2019t where every developmental psychologist is going to go, and it is not doing away with basic research in human interaction. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with a legend and pioneer of linguistics, Jean Berko Gleason. So linguistics was more philosophical in its earlier generations and became more of science, especially in your lifetime. I wonder, though, if, here at the 21st century, for whatever reason \u2014 it seems to me that in a lot of scientific fields, there are new philosophical questions emerging from the advanced science. You and I have touched on that a little bit. There are new, more sophisticated questions being asked about what intelligence is, and what makes us human, and how we learn. True, and you can ask those questions from all sides. Just let me back up for a moment, though, about linguistics, because linguistics has always had several threads. And one of them is philosophical. And, for instance, I would say that the nativist linguists stem from a very philosophical tradition, where you can think about language, for instance, you don\u2019t even need a lot of data, because you assume that everybody is exactly the same, so that if you think hard enough you\u2019ll understand how things happen, but they come from a very philosophical tradition. A lot of other linguistics stems \u2014 that is, modern linguistics \u2014 let\u2019s just talk about the 20th century. There were great linguists before that, and we could get back to Sanskrit, because the people who wrote Sanskrit down were terrific linguists. But in the 20th century, the people who did descriptive language \u2014 linguistics \u2014 who sat down and said, here\u2019s how the plural works, and here\u2019s how the past tense works, and here\u2019s what sentences look like, often had very pragmatic reasons and religious reasons for doing this. Linguistics has a huge religious history. Well, say some more about that. What \u2026 All right. I will. My brother-in-law, Henry Allan Gleason, Jr., was a linguist. He wrote a book called An Introduction to Descriptive Linguistics. It is the book that I read and used as a textbook as a student of linguistics. It\u2019s what I \u2014 when I made the Wug Test, it was his descriptions of how language works that I relied on, not something that came out of the more philosophical group. Now, the religious linguists were missionaries and one of their purposes \u2014 and they still exist \u2014 if you look up the group the Summer Institute of Linguistics, there are still people out there whose aim in life is to go to distant parts of the world, find languages that have not been written down, find people who speak those languages, sit down, figure out how the language works, get it written down, give the people a writing system so that they can give them the Bible. That is a major \u2014 linguistic missionaries were a major force in 20th-century American linguistics. So if you look up names like, well like Henry Allan Gleason or Kenneth Pike, a number of them were missionaries. Religious people who had \u2014 you go to India where you say, well, there are a thousand languages and an awful lot of them have not been written down. Let\u2019s get to work. Let\u2019s bring the Bible to the world. I want to come back to something that you wrote. This was a review of a book that you wrote in 2003, and the title, I think, is evocative \u2014 \u201CLanguage Acquisition: Is it Like Learning to Walk, or Learning to Dance?\u201D In that article, you wrote, \u201CPossibly, we are asking the wrong questions. For instance, when we look to innateness, why do we not consider what might be innate in us as nurturing adults?\u201D Yes, that is correct. And that\u2019s exactly what I was talking about with the animals, is that we \u2014 it\u2019s not just children who carry possibly innate things. We come with a long history of being attached to other living creatures. So to assume that children would just be picking up \u201Cbirdie\u201D and \u201Cdoggy\u201D because that\u2019s the way they are misses the point that we are that way too. And that we are bringing \u201Cdoggies\u201D and \u201Cbirdies\u201D to them and talking about them. So that\u2019s what I mean is that it\u2019s \u2014 language acquisition is a joint activity. And if there are innate components, there are innate components in adults as well as in children. And some of them are our attention to the world, and some of them are our love of other people. We are innately predisposed to pay attention to little children and to talk to them. So let\u2019s not just assume that we are scientists sitting around watching babies unfold. We\u2019re unfolding with them. It\u2019s a cooperative event. That\u2019s, I think, what I was saying, and that\u2019s part of what I meant when I wrote, think about what might be innate in all of us, not just the babies. How do you think you would ponder the question, or your sense of the question of what it means to be human? How do you think that\u2019s different because \u2014 or informed by this life you\u2019ve led, studying language? What it means to be human? Well, I think, ultimately, since we keep discovering, as we\u2019ve said through this past hour or so, that other creatures have many of the characteristics that we previously thought were only ours, and we find this increasingly \u2014 I think that what is most human about us \u2014 being human isn\u2019t being kind, because \u2014 remember the child that fell in the gorilla moat, and the gorilla picked it up tenderly and rescued it? Gorillas are kind. It isn\u2019t a lot of things. It isn\u2019t having technology, because chimpanzees make sticks to catch their termites, or whatever. They don\u2019t go to the moon with them, but I think that, for me, probably the biggest distinction \u2014 if we need to make a distinction, and by the way, I don\u2019t think we need to make any \u2014 I don\u2019t think that humans are not animals. We are animals. We are very complex animals, and we\u2019re very smart and very destructive. We have some good and bad qualities. But I guess for me, the most important difference I see is self-consciousness, is consciousness of ourselves, the ability to reflect on ourselves and to comment on that. Jean Berko Gleason is Professor Emerita of psychology at Boston University. While we were producing this show, a few of us experimented with recording our kids \u2014 the then two-and-a-half-year-old Delilah, five-year-old Lucy, and 13-year-old Sebastian. We had varying results: But we persevered. We listened for that amazing human capacity, as Jean Berko Gleason so evocatively put it, to be conscious and to comment on that. So maybe you\u2019d like to try this with the children or grandchildren in your life. We\u2019ve created a \u201CRaising Children\u201D collection at onbeing.org.
