  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CReligious Passion, Pluralism, and the Young.\u201D Young people want to impact the world. They want their footprint on Earth and they\u2019re going to do it somehow. So when people say to me, \u2018Oh, Eboo, you know, you run this sweet, little organization called the Interfaith Youth Core, and you do such nice things. You bring kids together.\u2019 I say, \u2018Yeah, you know, there\u2019s another youth organization out there. It\u2019s called al-Qaeda. And al-Qaeda\u2019s been built over the past 25 years and with lots of ideas of how you recruit young people and get them to think that this is the best way they can impact the world.\u2019 Eboo Patel is a young Muslim out to create an alternative. \u201CWe will not save ourselves and the next generation of every faith,\u201D he says, \u201Cby taming religious energy but by emboldening it.\u201D This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This hour, we revisit my 2005 conversation with Eboo Patel, who\u2019s just released a new book, Acts of Faith: The Story of an American Muslim, The Struggle for the Soul of a Generation. Eboo Patel calls al-Qaeda the most effective youth organization in the world today. But contrary to the wisdom of secular society, he is working to deepen, rather than tame the religious energies of the young across many traditions. And he believes this may be our only chance for survival. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CReligious Passion, Pluralism, and the Young.\u201D Eboo Patel was born in 1975 to a Muslim family of Indian heritage in a Chicago suburb. In his early 20s, he collaborated on projects around the world, including Sri Lanka, South Africa, and India. At the age of 23, after completing his doctorate in sociology while a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, he returned to Chicago to found the Interfaith Youth Core. Of all the differences between him and his Catholic, Mormon, Hindu, and Jewish friends in high school, he says, their personal religious beliefs were the most difficult to talk about. But Eboo Patel believes that giving young people fluency in the depths of their own religious traditions and those of others is work of extreme urgency. Religious people are changing our world. You can sit in a corner and whine about it. Or you can be on the bus and figure out how we can all work together to build a world, where people cooperate and live together in some sort of mutual loyalty. Eboo Patel\u2019s Interfaith Youth Core is creating ground-level interactions based on service among adolescents and young adults of many traditions. He calls this work \u201Ctrack to diplomacy.\u201D In many cultures, he says, religious elders and leaders can be difficult to engage with different beliefs. But their children have an openness to meaningful interaction and the possibility of change. And as Eboo Patel himself discovered, appreciative engagement with others often deepens one\u2019s own identity. Islam in Patel\u2019s family was important, but not fervent. At college, at the University of Illinois, he left faith behind but was drawn to social action. He wound his way back to Islam after becoming involved in projects of the Catholic Worker House Movement that was founded by the 20th-century social activist and present candidate for Catholic sainthood Dorothy Day. I loved the songs. And I bowed my head when there was prayer. The cross, the blood of Christ, the resurrection, those key symbols didn\u2019t speak to me in the same way that they spoke to Christians. Right. And at some point, a Catholic worker leader put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u2018Kid, you got to find a way to engage in social justice, mind, body, and soul.\u2019 And so I began reading in other religious traditions and interestingly enough, kind of avoided Islam until I met my grandmother again. And this is in the summer of 1998. I went to Bombay, India, the summer before I went to graduate school in England. And I discovered that my grandmother had this 40-year history of housing battered and abused women in her apartment in south Bombay. And she brought out all these Polaroids of these women from Hyderabad and Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. And finally, at the end of all these stories, I wanted to hear my grandmother\u2019s story. I said, \u2018Why do you do this?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Because I\u2019m a Muslim and this is what Muslims do.\u2019 And it was like heaven cracked open and spilled onto me. And I realized that there was a Dorothy Day figure in my faith, in my family. I was standing in an Indian/Muslim/Catholic worker house. Had you not known this about your grandmother or had you just not paid attention to it, do you think? You know, I hadn\u2019t paid attention. I mean, my grandmother was the woman, you know, who came to America for one month of the year and kind of poked her bony finger in my chest and said, \u2018Are you saying your prayers?\u2019 And, \u2018Are you,\u2019 you know, \u2018giving your money to the Muslim community?\u2019 And \u2018Are you going to marry a Muslim girl when you grow up?\u2019 Right. And it was like, you know, \u2018I\u2019m 12. I just want to skateboard.\u2019 OK. And it seems to me that you\u2019ve become engaged in this field of thinking hard about religion, religion in a pluralistic culture at a young age, and that you care deeply and are quite sensitive to why young people, and something that\u2019s very much in the news, young Muslims, seem to be susceptible to extremist\u2026 Right. \u2026religious ideas. How do you think about that phenomenon? And I think it is something that many people in our culture are puzzled by and would like to understand better. I think about the phenomenon of young people involved in religious violence primarily through thinking about what young people want. And I think that Gwendolyn Brooks, in this beautiful line from a poem called \u201CBoy Breaks Glass,\u201D articulates it best. And she speaks as if she were a young person. She says, \u201CI shall create, if not a note, a hole, if not an overture, a desecration.\u201D Young people want to impact the world. They want their footprint on Earth, and they\u2019re going to do it somehow. And if the only way that they get a chance to do that is by destroying things, then we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s the path they take. So when people say to me, \u2018Oh, Eboo, you know, you run this sweet, little organization called the Interfaith Youth Core, and you do such nice things. You bring kids together.\u2019 I say, \u2018Yeah, you know, there\u2019s another youth organization out there. It\u2019s called al-Qaeda. And al-Qaeda\u2019s been built over the past 25 years with lots of money, and with lots of strategy, and with lots of ideas of how you recruit young people and get them to think that this is the best way they can impact the world.\u2019 If you look at bin Laden\u2019s writing and speaking, he specifically articulates, \u201CAnd we are calling the young people of Islam.\u201D Well, there\u2019s a reason for that because he has a sense of the psychology of 16- to 24-year-olds. On the other hand, if you go to a lot of, quote, \u201Cmainstream religious communities,\u201D you look around, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Where are the 16- to 24-year-olds? They\u2019re not here.\u2019 I think what we have to do is figure out how to involve them. And, unfortunately, religious extremists have just been much more effective at that. So I, as I understand it, I mean, the work you\u2019re doing now is having, rather than theological discussion as the foundation or simple social gatherings, you\u2019re actually bringing young people together to engage in projects. That\u2019s right. OK. The first thing they do is have a common experience of serving someone else. They would build houses together. They would tutor children together. So you have this opportunity to see kind of the best in somebody else\u2019s tradition as you are practicing the best in your own. And then you have this opportunity to sit together afterwards and actually articulate that, say, \u2018This is what it is in Islam that inspires me to tutor this refugee kid. It is Sura 93 that does that.\u2019 And you hear this Christian kid talking about Matthew 25. And you hear this Jewish kid talking about tikkun olam. And that can be a song. For many people, it\u2019s a hero. You know, most of the times when we deal with kids and religion, we sit them down and we say, \u2018You believe in Moses, right?\u2019 Right. And the kid will go, \u2018I believe in Moses.\u2019 But when you ask the kid, \u2018What is it about Moses that inspires you to be a leader?\u2019 Man, that kid believes in Moses in a whole different way. This is also about people giving each other the gift of their questions as an outsider, someone from a different tradition asking an interesting question of another, and then that question itself causing the person who\u2019s been asked it to go deeper, to think harder. I think that\u2019s exactly right. I mean, there\u2019re these huge parts of our lives that are entirely private. They\u2019re our religious lives. And I felt like, when I was in high school, like I was hiding this stuff from my other friends. I didn\u2019t want them to know about Friday prayer in Islam. I didn\u2019t want them to know about Ramadan. I was, for some reason, embarrassed about it, almost. And I think perhaps the most wonderful surprise that we found in doing Interfaith Youth work is how excited 16-year-old religious kids are about talking about their religion with other kids. I got a phone call from a Catholic mom. And she said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done to my son. But after he\u2019s gone to a couple of your programs, he\u2019s starting to wake up early on Sunday and getting the whole family to go to church. And I would love to tell his grandmother about this, except I\u2019m afraid of admitting to her that we had stopped going to church for a while.\u2019 Activist and organizer Eboo Patel. Here are some voices from a discussion he led with a group of diverse teenagers after an afternoon of tutoring immigrant children. So today, we were teachers. And teaching is a sacred act, a point of enormous significance across religious traditions. So what I want to begin with is talking about important teachers in our different religious traditions, and what they inspire us to do as we move on in our lives and teach others. The first one is a piece I\u2019m learning in my own Tanach class, and it\u2019s Rambam. And he is important because we\u2019re studying about who you should give charity to. And he says that the one guy who, you know, claims to be starving should be saved, should be given money right away. But he also says you should be a light unto all nations. And you should help everyone equally. And I thought that was pretty prevalent for this group. But I also felt like Rashi is a really important scholar because he, for me, personally, because he allows his daughters to take on the same obligations as men. And they learned to do many Judaic things that women are still not today allowed to do in many traditions. And so, for me, he\u2019s a very powerful teacher. Well, the most powerful thing I taught is just, I think, just like informing everybody about my religion, my Catholic religion and my Catholic faith, and telling them what I\u2019m about. And the most important thing I\u2019ve learned is learning about everybody else\u2019s religion, how we all have similarities and sayings about keeping peace, like bringing, inviting other people who don\u2019t have clothes or stuff like that, you know, it almost matches up. Because Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was taught by the angel Gabriel, that means that every one of us needs a teacher in order to understand or learn something. Is there something particular about one of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s, peace be upon him, teaching that you think about? Yeah. Education is mandatory upon every human being, male and female. And it\u2019s mandatory, which is interesting. It\u2019s not just, like, you know, if learning something is left to, like, one part of the population, then the rest of the population will, you know, benefit from it. So everyone has to learn. Well, like, I\u2019ve known that we all have shared values and that we all speak for peace and equality and stuff like that. But I didn\u2019t know that the sayings in the Qur\u2019an, in the Torah, in the Bible, match up almost word for word. From a discussion at the Interfaith Youth Core directed by my guest, Eboo Patel. His approach of actively engaging religious ideals and differences cuts against the grain of some Western civic instincts. These instincts, he says, are failing us as our societies grow more pluralistic. The French, for example, have attempted to prevent religious tensions by forbidding public expressions of religious identity. By contrast, in India, the political economist Ashutosh Varshney has studied why some cities remain relatively calm when Hindu-Muslim tensions rise and others explode in violence. He found that civic associations to engage people around diverse religious identity can make that difference. Eboo Patel says Americans often wrongly suppose that in order to show respect for the beliefs of others, we must be discreet, even silent about our own. I think that that is perhaps the biggest misconception in the way we think about religion in public life. And here\u2019s an example of that. I was asked to give an address on religion and social action at Berea College, which is this small Christian college in Kentucky. And the hall where they have these speeches is their chapel. And this very sweet, liberal faculty member approached me and said, \u2018Listen, if you want, we can cover the cross. So if you feel uncomfortable as a Muslim\u2026 Right. Right. Right. \u2026speaking with this cross behind you.\u2019 And I said, \u2018You know, it\u2019s that cross that brought me here. It is your Christian conviction that asked a Muslim who believes in interfaith social action to come here. And I would not feel comfortable saying, \u201CBismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim, in the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.\u201D And that\u2019s the beginning of Muslim prayers. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. You\u2019re also kind of countering some of the ideas that are out there about why religious extremism happens, that it\u2019s a response to modernity. And you\u2019re sort of saying, no, you don\u2019t see it that way. That\u2019s right. I mean, if we understand modernity as people from different backgrounds living in close quarters, which is something that didn\u2019t happen as often perhaps 100 years ago. The southwest side of Chicago, 100 years ago, was largely Irish Catholic. Now, you\u2019ll hear the chanting of Buddhists in places. You\u2019ll smell Mexican food and Arab food. You don\u2019t have to kill the new people coming in. A lot of religious scholars say, \u2018Well, you know, religious fundamentalism or extremism is the inevitable response to modernity.\u2019 I think it\u2019s one response. And, unfortunately, the people, who want to respond that way to modernity, have built much stronger structures than those of us who seek to respond to the existence of diversity by building cooperation. We haven\u2019t built very strong structures. Where do you see examples of how those same energies and those same situations of pluralism, modernity, and religious energies can be channeled differently? I mean, what is different when it doesn\u2019t turn to violence? There are so many beautiful examples. And if one looks at any of the great freedom movements of the 20th century, whether it\u2019s the struggle in South Africa or Hind Swaraj in the subcontinent or the civil rights struggle in the United States, the leadership of those movements was not only religious, it was interfaith in character. So I think about the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. meeting the Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel\u2026 Right. \u2026in 1963 in Chicago, and them finding common ground on the Old Testament prophets, and then them marching together in Selma a couple years later. And Rabbi Heschel saying, \u201CI felt like my legs were praying.\u201D And the most influential person in King\u2019s life is, of course, Jesus. But perhaps the second most influential was a half-naked Hindu from India, Mahatma Gandhi. And King credits Gandhi with taking the love ethic of the social gospel of Christianity and making it a social reform movement. Right. And, you know, Martin Luther King comes up so much, Martin Luther King and Gandhi, I mean, you know, these, these few names we\u2019ve mentioned. Are there other figures like that who we don\u2019t know as much about? Sure. Let me say one thing about King and Gandhi, is how young they were when they started. When King led the bus boycott, he was 26. In South Africa, Gandhi was 24 when he led the first movement against the racist pass laws. But they are far from the only examples. I mean, I think about Farid Esack, who\u2019s a great hero of Islam, of mine, who helped start the Muslim Youth Movement in South Africa, which played a key role in the struggle. Right. I think about Abdul Ghaffar Khan, who was known as the Frontier Gandhi, who was a Pashtun from Afghanistan, and said that the Qur\u2019an is a document of peace, and would sit with Gandhi in villages in India where there was Hindu-Muslim tension, and chant alternately from the Bhagavad Gita and from the Qur\u2019an, saying, \u2018As long as the word of God is heard, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u2019 Eboo Patel. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CReligious Passion, Pluralism, and the Young.\u201D My guest, Eboo Patel, is a visionary organizer of young people across traditions. He set out to deepen their religious identities and to channel their natural desire to make a difference toward service. He\u2019s been doing this work since he was 23. And his goals are ambitious. I\u2019ll tell you a story that helped me start the Interfaith Youth Core. OK. I was at a World Council of Churches conference three years ago in Cyprus. And the keynote speaker was a Lebanese Catholic priest. And he began his speech by saying, \u2018I have a position of some influence in the Middle East. I am the director of religious education for all the Catholic schools of this particular Catholic order in the Middle East. And part of what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m transforming the way Islam and Judaism are taught in these schools, taught not as competing religions but as kindred religions.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You know where I got that idea from? Right here in this room 20 years ago at a World Council of Churches conference. I was brought on a youth scholarship. And it\u2019s where I first heard the idea that Catholics and Jews and Muslims should be able to cooperate.\u2019 And that\u2019s the way that I see the work that we\u2019re doing. So we work with all these kids from different religious backgrounds. And, you know, Catholic-school kids sometimes grow up to be cardinals. And Jewish girls sometimes grow up to run a Jewish federation. World Youth Day started in Rome 20 years ago, couple hundred thousand kids. A decade later in the Philippines, it had millions of kids. The pope transformed the way young people think about being Catholic. Did you see that photo collage in The New York Times last year after the Catholic Youth Day? There were four, six, or eight pictures of kids from all over the world. And it was so beautiful. They were so different and thrilling. That\u2019s right. You know what I find so fascinating, Krista, is that, is people who don\u2019t deal with religion regularly have this stereotype about what religious kids look like. Right, what would a Catholic look like. Exactly. And so\u2026 These pictures were nothing that you would imagine. Nose piercings and purple hair\u2026 Yeah. Yeah. We see that all the time at the Interfaith Youth Core. Now, I saw, you and I were both at the Mayor\u2019s Prayer Breakfast in Chicago. And there was a group of kids \u2013 they were part of your organization, right? That\u2019s right. I mean, kids were saying, I think they were probably, what, 14 to 24, maybe not. Right. They weren\u2019t all very young. And they did a presentation on the stage. And I\u2019ll just, you know, say, honestly, even I, in this line of work that I\u2019m in, I mean, sometimes when I hear there\u2019s going to be a presentation of interfaith youth, I might think that it\u2019s going to be kind of\u2026 Kumbaya-ish. Yeah. Thank you. And it was extremely moving and substantive and interesting and unpredictable. And I\u2019m thinking also that there was, in that group, and it was a range of kids from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic. And I think there was also a young woman who was atheist or not religious? Is that right? It\u2019s probably the case. Yeah. I mean, in the spectrum of spirituality in our culture today, and I think young people are especially open about this, there\u2019s also the stance of struggling with religion and asking big questions, but not embracing the traditions. And that whole spectrum, I think, is represented in your work. Is that right? Kind of. Kind of. OK. Right. We deal mostly with kids who identify with a religious tradition. You know how I think about a tradition? I think about Ani DiFranco playing Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201CDo Re Mi.\u201D Say some more. That\u2019s the tradition of folk music. And Woody Guthrie is one of the founders of that tradition. And when Ani DiFranco gets on stage and she says, \u2018I\u2019m going to play a song from my forefather,\u2019 she is saying, \u2018I know that I come from somewhere.\u2019 But she doesn\u2019t play that song exactly the way Woody Guthrie played it, right? I am inspired by my grandmother in India to do Muslim social action work. But her expression of that is in this very 1950s Indian way. It\u2019s taking people into her home. My expression of Muslim social action is founding an international nonprofit organization. So the basic value is the same, but the expression changes. That\u2019s how I understand a tradition. The basic values in a tradition \u2014 compassion and mercy and social action and love \u2014 stay the same. But different generations give different expression to those things. Talk to me about some of the problems you have and the challenges in doing interfaith work in early 21st century America in our culture. You know, what goes wrong? What do you have to struggle against? I\u2019ll tell you what I used to struggle against before September 11th, is people saying, \u2018Isn\u2019t religion dead?\u2019 Right. I remember a high school friend of mine wrote me an e-mail and said, \u2018What\u2019s this? I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re doing this thing called interfaith work? What happened to you, man? You ran off and joined the Flat Earth Society.\u2019 Right. Right. And then September 11th happened. And then the election of 2004 happened. And all of a sudden, we discovered that, you know, The Passion of the Christ is amongst the most popular movies a couple of years ago. And all of a sudden, we discovered that Rick Warren\u2019s The Purpose-Driven Life is the best-selling book in the world for two years. And we wake up and realize that 80-plus percent of our country believes in God, that over half regularly attends a religious service. And we say, \u2018Who are these other people?\u2019 And that\u2019s one of the things, frankly, that I find interesting about the media that I listen to, National Public Radio, The New York Times, is there is something about when we talk about religion, there is something of the \u2018Isn\u2019t this curious?\u2019 phenomenon. Right. Well, weren\u2019t they dead yesterday? Yeah? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You know, there are the aardvarks and there are the religious people, you know? Yes. Watch them behave in their ecologies. And perhaps that\u2019s one of my, that\u2019s a big challenge, is now that we are, as a culture, over the idea that religion is dead or dying, there is an increasing voice in our culture that said, \u2018It should be dead or dying.\u2019 Right. That, you know, \u2018Why are you voting Jesus? Why do you leave work on Friday at 1:00 to go pray? This is crazy.\u2019 And the way that I talk to my secular friends about that is, first of all, you would never say that about somebody\u2019s ethnic background. You would never say that about somebody\u2019s racial identity. You know, \u2018Why do you eat soul food?\u2019 You\u2019d never ask that. Right. You have a gut-level respect for people\u2019s identity when it comes to ethnicity, gender, class, race. Why not religion? And the second thing is religious people are changing our world. You can sit in a corner and whine about it, or you can be on the bus and figure out how we can all work together to build a world where people cooperate and live together in some sort of mutual loyalty. I\u2019ll tell you something: Muslims are not going to stop being Muslim. Right. Christians are not going to stop being Christian. The question is, the challenge is, how do we promote a way of being Christian and Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist and Hindu that lives in cooperation with other people? Interfaith Youth Core founder and director Eboo Patel. Here\u2019s the illustration he mentioned of his definition of tradition: Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201CDo Re Mi\u201D followed by Ani DiFranco\u2019s contemporary adaptation.

Re, a drop of golden sun. Mi, a name I call myself. Fa, a long, long way to run. It\u2019s a long, long way to run, a long, long way to run\u2026 I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. (singing) You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can\u2019t deal nobody harm, or take your vacation by the mountains or sea. Don\u2019t swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are, you better take this little tip from me. \u2018Cause I look through the want ads every day, but the headlines on the papers always say: \u201CIf you ain\u2019t got the do re mi, boys, you ain\u2019t got the do re mi, why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee. California is a Garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see; but believe it or not, you won\u2019t find it so hot if you ain\u2019t got the do re mi.\u201D Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today we\u2019re exploring a new approach to religious passion, pluralism, and the young, the work of a young Muslim-American, activist Eboo Patel. Growing up in a Chicago suburb and later as a Rhodes Scholar, he began to question an educated assumption that religious identity among the young must be disaffected or dangerous in a pluralistic world. The Interfaith Youth Core that he founded in Chicago now has outreach projects in 24 states and several countries, including Jordan, Nigeria, Ireland, and Liberia. The Core brings young people together to work on service projects. Friendship and discussion flow out of shared experiences that involve, as Patel says, practicing the best of one\u2019s own tradition and seeing the best at work in others. He insists that this is not mere idealism; it is a pragmatic and genuinely enlightened response to the plural religious vigor of the world we now inhabit. I\u2019ve come to the point, and perhaps this is my cynicism, I say, \u2018Well, you know, if you want to try to leap to the moon, you can try to do that, too.\u2019 That\u2019s the parallel to waving your flag and saying religion should die. Right. The other thing is it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, frankly, prejudicial, it\u2019s \u2014 Louis Lapham, in Harper\u2019s, wrote this, this screed about how America\u2019s recent intoxication with religion is ruining this country. And he said, \u2018When I was at Yale in the 1950s, the only thing we talked about was the anatomy of God\u2019s death.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018That is amongst the most insulting things that you could say to 85 percent of your country people.\u2019 Right. So that might fly in certain spaces on the Upper East Side of New York, but let me tell you something, you are going to hurt a lot of people in the vast swaths of this world if you go around saying that. I like it also that you are concerned about that because Louis Lapham, I believe, was writing mostly about America\u2019s Christian intoxication, right? But, you know, you\u2019re Muslim and you\u2019re also saying\u2026 Right. In fact, particularly evangelicals, right. And we work with a lot of evangelicals, and I have crazy respect for evangelicals. What do you mean by that? There\u2019s a great line in a Paul Simon song, \u201CFaith is an island in the setting sun, proof is the bottom line for everyone.\u201D And people who can keep ideas of the transcendent in front of their face in a world dominated by the material are people that have earned my respect a hundred times over. Now, I might disagree with evangelicals on a lot of things, but I know that AIDS in Africa would not be addressed in the same way without evangelicals\u2019 concern. I know that there would be a lot of women in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia still in prostitution if not for the work of evangelicals. Yeah. And I look at them and I say, \u2018You know, we can work together on this. My Muslim values have a profound overlap with your evangelical values. And if you feel the need to pray for my soul in your church, you go right ahead. That is your right in this country. And if you feel that\u2019s an obligation of your religion, please do that. And when we\u2019re together, let\u2019s not spend all of our time trying to convert each other, let\u2019s spend some of our time trying to help other people.\u2019 When you talk about understanding or asserting that religion is not going to go away, religious passions are not going to die and therefore we have to find new ways of being religious together, it seems to me, in what I read of you and know of your work, that, you know, part of the new paradigm you\u2019re suggesting is to say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m going to be working side by side with people who would like to convert me, and that\u2019s OK.\u2019 You\u2019re not accepting some of the framework of what we\u2019ve taken as acceptable civic behavior. That\u2019s exactly right. Interfaith work has been constructed as if it is primarily about belief. So we\u2019re trying to change the way Christians believe about Buddhists. The way that I see that is somebody\u2019s belief is their own business. It is not my right to tell you how to think about God. It is not my right to tell you how to think about heaven. But it is my right to say we live on the same block together, we live in the same city together, we\u2019ve got to get this right. Can we at least wave at each other when we walk down the street? Can we coach each other\u2019s son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s little league team? Can we maybe start a block club together? There\u2019s this public square aspect to religious identity, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to getting right. But, you know, I think what\u2019s a little bit different in what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re also saying, \u2018I might be offended and upset by that person\u2019s belief, but as long as it\u2019s not being imposed on me, that can\u2019t be a stumbling block to my living with that person and working with that person.\u2019 I mean, here\u2019s a sentence you wrote; \u201CEven most of those who strongly believe that anybody other than the most righteous of their religious tribe is bound for eternal hellfire, do not generally find it acceptable practice to send people there by the human hand.\u201D That\u2019s exactly right. I\u2019ll tell you a story and then I\u2019ll tell you the larger dynamic that I\u2019m very concerned about. I spend most of my time observing how religious people actually interact. I spend less of my time reading theology, because I\u2019m primarily concerned with how human beings can live together on Earth, not what human beings write in books. And the Moody Bible School, which is a leading training ground for \u201CWe should convert the Muslims\u201D type evangelicals\u2026 Right. In Chicago, I believe. \u2026in Chicago, right down the street from my office. And the Moody Bible students would work at the cafe right next door, and I\u2019d walk in and order my morning mocha and, you know, kind of hang out with these 21-year-old kids who were, you know, training to convert Muslims. And they\u2019d be like, \u2018So man, you know, you\u2019re here every day, what do you do?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, I run this interfaith organization. We bring young people from different religions together,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u201CTo spread the gospel?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201CWell, kind of. To build cooperation.\u201D They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh. What are you, man?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m a Muslim.\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, yeah, a Muslim. Yeah.\u2019 You know, they\u2019re learning about Muslims. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Uh-huh, yeah, I\u2019m a really deeply committed Muslim, and my Muslimness is what inspires me to work for cooperation.\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t hear that much about that. That\u2019s really cool, though. You want whipped cream on your mocha?\u2019 So I know that they\u2019re being taught at Moody. \u2018Every time you come into contact with a Muslim, practice converting them.\u2019 Right? Yeah. But in their actual everyday real life interaction, they don\u2019t do that. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to build on. Now, if I were to walk into Moody and say, \u2018You better change your curriculum and you better change the way you believe about Muslims\u2026\u2019 Right. \u2026forget about it, we\u2019re going to fight. But if I can find a way of interacting with this Moody Bible School kid in a way that enhances the common ground between us and says, \u2018You and I can have a conversation that\u2019s not about conversion. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t try to convert me, I\u2019m just saying let\u2019s not only have that conversation.\u2019 It\u2019s the same thing I say to Muslims and Jews when they get in the same room. \u2018You know what, the conversation you\u2019ve been taught to have is the Middle East. You\u2019re taught to come in here and start arguing about the Middle East. That conversation exists. But let\u2019s not make that the only conversation we can have.\u2019 And Krista, I\u2019ll tell you who\u2019s figured this out is conservatives. Evangelicals and Catholics work very hard together\u2026 Right. \u2026on pro-life issues in America and go their separate ways on the Iraq war. Well, and, yeah. Now, how come\u2026 There is also this real theological divide. But you\u2019re right, they\u2019re working together very practically and effectively on issues they both care about. Right. And, you know, this is, in some ways, the Interfaith Youth Core\u2019s ideas of interfaith work stems out of American pragmatism, which is, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the ways people actually interact and live and think and work, and let\u2019s base what we do off of that.\u2019 I\u2019ll tell you the danger here: the danger is this extremely small group of people called religious totalitarians. Now, that\u2019s your phrase that you prefer to. Right. What do you prefer that to? What are the words we use that you don\u2019t like? Well, for me, it\u2019s the best word, and you can also use \u201Cextremist\u201D or \u201C\u2018radical,\u201D but totalitarianism means people who are committed to condemning or converting or killing everybody who does not share their interpretation of their religious tradition. That\u2019s what a totalitarian is. And it\u2019s dramatically different than an evangelical or than a conservative or than a traditionalist. You can believe that everybody, except your tribe, is not going to share heaven with you and still live in perfect peace and harmony and be an excellent neighbor. Right. Right. And once we start getting into changing other people\u2019s beliefs, I think that we\u2019re being presumptuous. I also think we\u2019re not being strategic, because people aren\u2019t going to let you into their door if you say, \u2018Guess what, if you give me a seat at your dining room table, I\u2019m going to try to change the way you think about God. I\u2019m going to meddle with the most precious thing in your life.\u2019 OK. So this makes me think about attitudes that have been adopted and accepted and what\u2019s implicit in them in the last few decades. The idea of tolerance did kind of mean that you weren\u2019t supposed to believe things that were even critical of the person who was different. And I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something generational happening. I mean, is there, or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re Muslim and not Christian. You know, what is it that allows you to be that much more generous about other people\u2019s beliefs, and still want to carve out this space where you can work with them? I think you\u2019re giving too much credit when you say generous. I think we are doing what works. Getting this right, getting the way religiously diverse people work with each other right is a matter of life and death. We have to do what works. Interfaith Youth Core founder Eboo Patel. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CReligious Passion, Pluralism, and the Young,\u201D a conversation with Eboo Patel, who\u2019s out to change the way young people of faith relate to their own religious traditions and those of others. This summer\u2019s car bomb attempts in Britain revived memories of the bombs that went off in London\u2019s transport system in July 2005, killing 52 people. Of that event, Eboo Patel wrote in the Chicago Tribune, \u201CI cannot stop staring at a map of central London, the one with the four explosions on it. Edgware Road, Aldgate, Russell Square, Tavistock Square, it sounds like the itinerary of my regular trips to London when I was a graduate student at Oxford University a few years ago. The calm those places provided was shattered by a group of young men who traced their heritage to the region of the world where I was born, and who prayed in the same language I consider holy. A city I love was bombed by people my community could have influenced.\u201D The problem is the disaffection of a younger generation of Muslims from an older generation. Yeah, say some more about that. Well, in the wake of the London bombings, the smartest thing that was said was by this early 20-something, working-class kid in Leeds in northern England. He said to a BBC reporter, \u2018The older generation and the younger generation don\u2019t talk the way you think they should.\u2019 The older generation who came from North Africa and South Asia and the Pacific East, their relationship to the tradition of Islam and how it translated into the West is very different from how their kids experience being both Muslim and Briton or Muslim and German or Muslim and American. And the Osama bin Ladens of the world understand that profound generational religio-cultural gap, and they exploit it. So you\u2019ve got these disaffected kids sitting in a mosque, and somebody stands up and says, \u2018Why are you participating in the permissiveness of this Western society when your brothers and sisters are getting murdered on the other side of the world?\u2019 And the older generation oftentimes has not figured out a way to translate Islam such that it makes sense in a positive constructive way. So that kind of statement is very compelling, you\u2019re saying, that they \u2014 and that might be the most compelling language they\u2019ve heard, using Islam. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the most relevant language they\u2019ve heard about Islam to their lives. It gives them a sense of power and identity. OK. And we can provide the same thing. I mean, think about what the Montgomery Improvement Association did for African-Americans in Montgomery in 1955. You know, people say, \u2018Oh, you know, religious violence is caused by poverty and oppression.\u2019 Well, you know, blacks in Montgomery in 1955 were poor and oppressed, and they didn\u2019t kill other people. What did they do? They were led on a path of constructive peace-building because somebody shone the light on that path. So that became their religious identity. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re shining a light on a different path. We\u2019re trying to shine the light on it, and we\u2019re trying to walk it. We\u2019re trying to walk it. We\u2019re figuring out there\u2019s a lot of folks ahead of us, and there\u2019s a lot of folks with us, and we\u2019re hoping that more and more join. I take all religious violence, particularly violence committed by Muslims upon anybody, but perhaps especially other Muslims, very personally. And I want to wake up one day and not have that be in my newspaper. Perhaps, for me, one of the most profound teachings of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is that he would go to the cave of Mount Hira every year to pray and to fast and to give alms to the poor. And of course, one fateful day in the year 610, he was visited by the angel Gabriel. The angel gripped him and said, \u201CIqra, recite.\u201D And the first words of the Qur\u2019an came pouring out of the Prophet\u2019s mouth. And he never went back to that cave. He lived the rest of his life in the world building Islam. And that\u2019s the only way that I can think of living is in the world, building interfaith cooperation from my Muslim inspiration. That\u2019s the way that I deal with religious violence is just waking up and saying, \u2018I\u2019m doing something about this.\u2019 And maybe all these other people who are also doing something about this will one day end this. Eboo Patel is founder and executive director of the Chicago-based Interfaith Youth Core. He\u2019s new book is Acts of Faith: The Story of an American Muslim, the Struggle for the Soul of a Generation. Here in closing is an exchange that took place during one of his projects: (Beginning of Interfaith Youth Core conversation) I want to ask Aisha what you think Adina has taught in this space, and Adina, what you think Aisha has taught in this space? And Aisha, why don\u2019t you go first. : It\u2019s such a huge question. I mean, I\u2019ve just learned so much about Judaism in terms of the practices, the beliefs. But I think, more specifically, I\u2019ve learned that Adina\u2019s just like me. I know it sounds like really simple. But really, I mean, you know, we don\u2019t really have many differences. : You stole what I was going to say. Like, it was really powerful for me to see like how pervasive both the faiths are. Like, beyond the fact that we\u2019re friends and like, that that\u2019s important, that we all can relate, but that everything is interfaith, that there really isn\u2019t a way where you like draw the line. There\u2019s not an end. It\u2019s not like it ends when you leave this. The circle is not going to end when you leave this group. Like, everything you can possibly imagine has another faith as a component to it. And that was really profound. We\u2019re making it easier for you to listen to Speaking of Faith.
