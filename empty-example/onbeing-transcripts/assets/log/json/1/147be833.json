  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CAfrican-American, Woman, Leader,\u201D qualities this presidential election has at times pitted at odds. My guest this hour, Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, holds them all together. She also sheds light on the socially critical tradition of African-American Christianity that became a point of political controversy in this election year. We offer her wisdom and good humor as an edifying lens on the American past, present, and future. I live for the day. I live for the day. I\u2019ve said over and over again, I live for the day when my gender and my race means nothing \u2014 means nothing \u2014 that my gifts, my skills, my character, my mental astuteness, these things qualify me to do the job. Period. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. I\u2019ve been wanting to interview Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie all year. The current U.S. election has illustrated how gender, race, and religion can become lightning rods and seen as potential stumbling blocks to leadership. Vashti McKenzie is a pioneering figure on all these fronts and all at the same time. When she became the first woman bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest the of the historic black churches dating back to the early days of the American republic, she declared, \u201CThe stained glass ceiling has been pierced and broken.\u201D Vashti McKenzie also sheds light this hour on the socially critical tradition of African-American Christianity that became a point of political controversy in this election year. We offer her story, her wisdom, and her good humor as an edifying lens on the American past, present, and future. I live for the day. I live for the day. I\u2019ve said over and over again, I live for the day when my gender and my race means nothing \u2014 means nothing \u2014 that my gifts, my skills, my character, my mental astuteness, these things qualify me to do the job. Period. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CAfrican-American, Woman, Leader: Meeting Vashti Murphy McKenzie.\u201D Vashti McKenzie was ordained a bishop in 2000 and now leads the 13th Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, or AME. The roots of the AME were laid in 1787 when preacher and former slave Richard Allen and other black Methodists walked out of a church in Philadelphia to protest their treatment by whites. For Vashti McKenzie, religion was just one supportive aspect of an altogether empowering upbringing. Her great-grandfather founded a chain of African-American newspapers in 1892. Her maternal grandfather, Carl Murphy, had five daughters and raised them to carry on the family business. Vashti McKenzie at first followed in this tradition, becoming a broadcaster and corporate vice president of programming at a TV station. She married an NBA basketball star, Stan McKenzie, who\u2019s been her husband now for 40 years and with whom she has three children. Then in the late 1970s, she preached her first sermon in a pulpit in her native Baltimore and knew that this was her life\u2019s calling. Yet through all her accomplishments, Vashti McKenzie has experienced the crosshairs, as she puts it, of racism and sexism. I have been female and African-American all my life. When I look back over the places where I\u2019ve been in life, I have not been in, traditionally, places, roles, functionalities that were traditionally female except for I think one time. But doing Morning Drive, Morning Drive was not at that time in the \u201960s a traditional place for a woman to be. Being a program director in a major market, Washington, D.C. \u2014 and we got good ratings, yay. But that was not a traditional role for women. Being a general manager of a radio station at the time was not a traditional role for a woman. So to be able to face the jokes. You know, you\u2019d come into work and you\u2019re program director now so you are going off shift and you\u2019re going to handle the administrative responsibilities and duties. And the next person coming behind you, I\u2019d give a little reminder. I said, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to leave the studio the way you found it.\u2019 And so the young man said to me, \u2018But you can\u2019t tell me what to do, because a woman is not supposed to tell a man what to do.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 I\u2019m your program director. I sign your checks, you know. Pardon me. And he says, \u2018Well, the Bible says that a wife is supposed to submit herself to her husband.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Am I married to you?\u2019 And he says, \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Then make sure the studio looks like this when you go off shift.\u2019 And it\u2019s those kinds of things that you face on a daily basis. You know, those kinds of things. And it becomes very disappointing when you believe that you\u2019re holding hands with your brothers who are of African descent, who you believe that together we\u2019re going to help open the doors for the generation that are coming behind us, and together we\u2019re going to work to be sure that people don\u2019t look at our color first but they look at our skills, our qualifications, our education, our background. And then all of sudden the hand that you\u2019re holding turns around and closes the door in your face because you\u2019re a woman, see. And so that\u2019s what it means being in the crosshairs. It\u2019s sort of like a double-whammy. You know, bam, you get hit because of your color, and then you get hit again because of your gender. Now, you were, is this right, in sixth grade when integration arrived in Baltimore. Yes. How did that imprint your sense of what it meant to be African-American culturally? I mean, did that make you more aware of your race than you had been before? Yes. I believe that, you know, growing up in Baltimore we were in a very wonderful community where we knew everybody in the neighborhood, and it was a wonderful affirming place. In school, your schoolteachers were likely to be the same persons who were your Sunday school teachers. It\u2019s like a unit between the church, the school, and the community. It was a wonderful incubator, you know, just a wonderful incubator. And then all of a sudden integration comes and we are bussed across town to a new school where, instead of being a part of a majority, you are a part of a minority. You may be the only person who is of African descent in your class. There may be two or three of you. I don\u2019t remember; I believe there were only about seven to 10 kids in this humongous elementary school where I finished the sixth grade. And of course they couldn\u2019t get my name right. I was Vash-tee and I kept saying, no, I am Vash-tye. Or, \u2018You\u2019re Wash-tee,\u2019 and, no. And the kids in the class, \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t your mother name you Mary or Ann like the rest of us?\u2019 \u2018Because my name is not Mary or Ann like the rest of you. It is Vashti.\u2019 \u2018Well, we have to find a name. We have to call you something; we just can\u2019t call you your name.\u2019 And then all of sudden you\u2019ve become an oddity, and it was really a new experience. And so you find yourself in a position where you have to teach people about your culture and your heritage because they didn\u2019t know and they didn\u2019t understand. And that\u2019s not an easy thing to do when you\u2019re in sixth or seventh or eighth grade, when you\u2019re wrestling with your identity at such a fundamental level as well. Mm-hmm. Well, at that point you find that you have to prove yourself every day. Before then you were just you. Here you are, you\u2019re in class with teachers who, you know, looked at you and expected you to do great things. Then you\u2019re thrust into an environment where people expect you to fail. They look for you to fail. They look for you to be in the lowest reading group. They look for you to do the worst in math. And so you find you have to prove different. The school was wonderful because they had a whole lot of others things that we didn\u2019t have. You know, I was at Robert Brown Elliot School Number 104, which, at the top of the school, in stone, it said, \u201CColored School Number Nine.\u201D All we had was a playground and a cafeteria. But at this new school, there was a gymnasium. We\u2019d never had a gymnasium before. They had a band. Track and field outside out back. I mean, it was like, wow. You know, they had all these kinds of things that we didn\u2019t have in our elementary school, which was wonderful, but I was already taking piano lessons. So when I got to that school they said, \u2018Well, we already have a student playing piano. You\u2019ll have to learn another instrument. Gosh. I said, \u2018OK, fine.\u2019 And you find that in every place that you\u2019re put, you have to prove your existence, that you have a right to be there. And that\u2019s what African-Americans and that\u2019s what women do every day in a leadership position. You have to prove that you have a right to be there. Bishop Vashti McKenzie. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CAfrican-American, Woman, Leader.\u201D Before Vashti McKenzie became the first female bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, she spent 10 years as the first female pastor of the historic Payne Memorial Church in Baltimore. As she was about to accept that call in 1990, one bishop pulled her aside to question her readiness. \u201CHe said,\u201D she\u2019s written, \u201Cthat my failure would not just be my personal failure; it would mean that a woman would not be appointed to such a charge for a very long time.\u201D Under Vashti McKenzie\u2019s leadership, Payne Memorial not only grew, it launched multiple community projects, including a Human and Economic Development Center with a senior adult daycare and a Head Start program. Payne Memorial also secured a $1.5 million welfare-to-work contract with the state of Maryland. This kind of social engagement is a contemporary expression of the traditional role of African-American churches as a hub of common life, not just worship. Vashti McKenzie says this kind of action is essential in light of her theology and the African Methodist Episcopal Church\u2019s sense of mission. You know, it\u2019s seek out and save the lost. Visit the sick. Cheer the fallen. Encourage thrift, economic thrift. You know, housing. Visit those who are in prison. And these are biblically based. These are not things that were just grabbed out of the air. When you go to Matthew, the 25th chapter, when Jesus says, you know, when the people respond, \u201CWhen did we see you hungry? When did we see you in prison?\u201D And the Lord\u2019s response is, \u201CAs you\u2019ve done it unto the least of these you\u2019ve done it unto me.\u201D Mm-hmm. You know, for me the church ought to be a center of the community. And being in the community, then, our responsibility is not only to those who are members of your church; our responsibility is also to those who live in the shadow of \u2014 I call it the shadow of your citadel. And so there is a neighborhood, there is a community of needs and beings and so the church ought to respond to that. And being at Payne \u2014 and you must understand, every church I\u2019ve pastored, I was the first woman. OK. It\u2019s not just Payne. All right. Every church. Every church along the way, I was the first woman to pastor that congregation. I\u2019m excited to say that I was not the last woman to pastor. But being in Payne Memorial and that northwest Baltimore area, that congregation for the most part people drove in from other neighborhoods to attend that congregation. They used to live around there. But around that neighborhood, there was violence. There was crime. There was drug activity. There was prostitution. There were people who were hungry, people who were homeless on the street. So what are we supposed to do? Drive in, have our wonderful service, and go home? OK. And not do anything to enhance the life of those who live around your congregation? And so then our job is, is to be sure that the power that is on the inside becomes the power that reaches the people on the outside. So that means you do more than have a food pantry, where once a week people who are hungry can come with a sack and we give you non-perishable food items. You have to go beyond that. You know, it\u2019s like, \u2018I saw you last week. Now what are you going to do this week to be sure you\u2019re not in my line next week?\u2019 Right. What can we do to help you and empower you next week? And so that was your welfare-to-work programming that you started. It\u2019s a natural lead-in. The outreach center, you know, started with, of course, the food pantry and the clothes pantry \u2014 the traditional things that happen. And then we moved to helping people with their shut-off and cut-off notices. And then we became like the referral agency. \u2018I need help.\u2019 \u2018OK. Let\u2019s see how we can connect you to the appropriate agency or organization in the community, in the city, that can help you with that need.\u2019 Because some people just can\u2019t navigate all the red tape that they face when they need help. Or they don\u2019t know where to go for help. And so the natural progression was to move into a place where we train persons for jobs and, you know, held their hands while they navigated coming out of tennis shoes and jeans. And we had a professional clothes closet. We did soft skills of how to get your r\u00E9sum\u00E9 out, how to do an interview, how to do all those kinds of things, and then go through the training program. So we did all of the prep work. You really helped connect the dots. Sure. These very practical dots. And it\u2019s called demonstrating the love of God in tangible and practical ways. You became a bishop. That was your next move from Payne Memorial. That\u2019s correct. And so now in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, as in many Protestant churches, you feel a calling to run for bishop. You run for bishop. It\u2019s kind of a political process; it\u2019s not an appointment from on high. So tell me, did you start to feel that calling to a broader leadership in those experiences you\u2019re describing? Is that something you can trace? Yes. I believe that there is a call to the episcopacy. I believe it\u2019s more than a decision. You don\u2019t just wake up in the morning and say, \u2018Well, you know, I\u2019ve done this long enough. It\u2019s time for me to go do something else.\u2019 Or, you know, \u2018I\u2019m ready for the next level of service.\u2019 I believe that just as there\u2019s a call to preach and there\u2019s a call to pastor, there\u2019s a call to teach. I believe there\u2019s a call to Episcopal service, because the road to being elected is not an easy one. It is not an easy one for your family and it\u2019s not an easy one for you. It is a political process. You have to campaign. Every four years, the AME Church holds a general conference. There are delegates who come from all over the world, who come from, of course, the United States, the Caribbean, England, Europe, Africa, Canada. They come from all over the world, and they will elect Episcopal leaders. And so you have to present yourself to these delegates, because they\u2019re going to vote for you. And that means you\u2019re going to have to travel. You\u2019re going to have to go outside of your annual conference. You have to hit the campaign trail. Yeah, you\u2019ve got to hit the campaign trail. And that\u2019s exactly what you do. And there, of course, we have campaign workers. You\u2019ve got volunteers. You\u2019ve got T-shirts. You\u2019ve got banners. Videos. I heard that you had a great video that greeted people at the convention, about your life and ministry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The whole thing is how do I get the message to people beyond the political barriers. It\u2019s the same thing that the candidates are doing now. Yeah. But my campaign was on my track record, my experience. And I told people, \u2018Don\u2019t elect me, because I\u2019m a woman. Elect me because I\u2019m qualified to do the job. Elect me if you want me to be your bishop, because, you know, one day I just might be. You know, I haven\u2019t served all my life, I haven\u2019t worked all my life, to be a novelty, to be a token anything, just to dress up the stage, you know, to be the feminine presence in all this kind of thing.\u2019 It seems to me that you had a pretty challenging or at least stretching adventure your first appointment as bishop. You went to serve as the chief pastor of the 18th Episcopal District in southeast Africa, and so you were in Lesotho and Swaziland, Botswana, Mozambique. But tell me how that time in Africa continued to evolve and shape your theology and your understandings of ministry and leadership. Well, Africa was and is a great place to do ministry, because there are so many needs. And it\u2019s not difficult to convince people, \u2018Well, you know, we have a problem here.\u2019 \u2018Yes, we have a problem.\u2019 \u2018Now let us all come together and see how we\u2019re going to solve the problem.\u2019 They\u2019re going to say, \u2018Yes. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 Which is different. You know, when you\u2019re in the United States and you say, \u2018Hmm, have you noticed the neighborhood is decaying and we really ought to do something about it.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll go home to the suburbs and we\u2019ll think about it. We\u2019ll come back and when we have an official board we\u2019ll discuss it.\u2019 Yes. But, you know, you\u2019re in Africa and there was the HIV/AIDS pandemic and in that southern region you had 7,000 people dying every week. Church life is interrupted, because pastors and people have to pull together resources to bury people. And you have children who were left by the roadside or who were left on the steps of hospitals that are already overburdened. And you have 10-year-olds raising their three- and five- and six-year-old siblings, because their parents are in various stages of death and dying. I\u2019ve seen poverty in the United States. I\u2019ve seen what poor is. I\u2019ve seen hunger here. I\u2019ve seen homeless here. But you have never seen poverty as it is in Africa. It will break your heart. Did that put you more in touch with the prophetic tradition of the African-American church in particular? You mean African Methodist Episcopal Church? Well, yeah, but even I think African-American theology in general in the United States has \u2014 it\u2019s in the Bible, OK, but, I mean, in terms of churches that have retained that at their core. I think that\u2019s more true of African-American theology in the United States perhaps. Did it awaken that in you or deepen that in you? I couldn\u2019t say it awakened in me because I felt that I\u2019d been at it all along in the prophetic social-Gospel tradition, all along. And so it\u2019s a continuum. It says, yeah, you\u2019re right on course. You are right in line. You are stepping in the right direction in your preaching, in your theology, in your approach to ministry. Here is Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie preaching at the Washington National Cathedral in January. She\u2019s expounding on the biblical story of the 40 years the ancient Israelites spent in the desert, after they had been liberated from Egypt, before they reached the Promised Land. The Exodus story of the Israelites\u2019 liberation from slavery and their guiding figure of Moses are pivotal in African-American biblical interpretation and theology. In other words, God said to Moses, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019 and Moses turned around and told the people the same thing. And so if we\u2019re talking about the pursuit of happiness, it appears that God indicates that direction is just as important as destination. The destination was set, the promised place of God. They knew where it was located. They were in the general vicinity for more than three decades. It wasn\u2019t a new destination and neither were the people just informed about it, for the promised place of God was in their mission statement for 400 years and a part of the strategic plan at least for 38. They didn\u2019t know where to go. They knew where it was, but they just couldn\u2019t get there. And so all they were doing was going around and around in circles. They were marking time in merry-go-round agendas. Do you think we do the same now? Is God saying to us this morning, \u2018Enough is enough. You\u2019ve been going around in circles long enough.\u2019 Merry-go-round agendas with the lives of people; merry-go-round agendas where some people have everything and others have nothing; going around in merry-go-round circles where race and gender qualifies you or disqualifies you for an office, whether it\u2019s the president of the United States or the president of the eatin\u2019-meetin\u2019-greetin\u2019 club. We know the destination. Our direction is confused. And God says we have walked around in circles long enough. You see, they were delivered but they were not free. There\u2019s that word again. They were delivered, but they were not free. Vashti McKenzie preaches with her whole body, so we\u2019ve posted video of her preaching this past Easter Sunday at Trinity United Church in Chicago, the former congregation of Senator Barack Obama. You can watch her speak about the need for prophetic passion in American Christianity and witness how her words resonate with that predominately African-American congregation. And we also wrote about the rigorous task of researching and selecting audio clips of Vashti McKenzie\u2019s preaching. Read a behind-the-scenes account of that process on our blog, SOF Observed, and tell us what you think. We want to know not only if we hit the mark, but how these selections resonated with you. Look for links on our homepage, speakingoffaith.org. After a short break, Vashti McKenzie sheds light on the prophetic tradition of preaching and social criticism to which she belongs and which came to public attention in sound bite form when scrutiny focused on Jeremiah Wright, the former minister of Trinity United Church of Christ. Also, her thoughts on life beyond the election. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CAfrican-American, Woman, Leader: Meeting Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie.\u201D Vashti McKenzie is bishop of the 13th Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, or AME. In 2004, she was also elected president of the Council of Bishops of the AME, yet another first as a woman. Her life reflects a convergence of themes that have come to the surface of American life during the current presidential campaign \u2014 race, gender, leadership, and religion. Vashti McKenzie values the prophetic tradition of socially activist thought and preaching. This became a focus of political analysis and controversy when portions of sermons of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, were publicized this past spring. Vashti McKenzie has long known Jeremiah Wright as a friend and has preached across the years at his former church, Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. I do want to ask you about some of the issues that were raised in our culture, but I think not anywhere near resolved, around the person of Jeremiah Wright in the context of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign. And I don\u2019t want to talk so much, you know, about him but about \u2014 here\u2019s one question I\u2019d like to ask you is just how you experienced that conflict. You know, what you longed for people to have a better grasp of to be able to put any of that into context. I\u2019ve kind of asked you a bunch of questions there, but wherever you\u2019d like to weigh in. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. First one was how was the experience. It was painful. It was very, very painful to watch and hear and listen to the negative firestorm that came at the end of a successful pastoral ministry. Very painful. And a lot of it was only because Senator Obama was a member of that congregation. Secondly, I don\u2019t think people understand black theology. Yeah. They need to read Cone\u2019s books and all the others. And I think Cone did an excellent job in interviews and others in sharing. James Cone, right? James Cone, right. About theology, black theology. And the reason why I said it is the lens. In other words, theology is the system through which you evaluate and interpret Scripture or ministry and all of that. And then there is a thought of universal theology; in other words, the universal human experience. But for many African-Americans and for women there is \u2014 they\u2019re not a part of that universal experience. And so the starting point for your interpretation, the starting point for building your theology, comes out of the African-American experience. OK. Just as womanist theology begins with the woman experience as the starting point, building the lens through which you interpret. So I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand it, and there are some grabbed it and ran with it in a direction that sort of startled everybody. And, you know, preacher after preacher and bishop after bishop through the years had preached similar things, but nobody raked them over the coals. And of course the thing that was on YouTube that I guess started the whole ball rolling was not what he was saying. He was quoting someone else who is not African-American. Right. And I\u2019m just trying to cast my mind back. It was about \u2014 it was linking the events of September 11th in a broad historical perspective with American actions in the rest of the world. Sure. Right? It was making connections between events and moral culpability. It wasn\u2019t his thought. Right. And it wasn\u2019t his thought. It wasn\u2019t his thought. He was expounding on it. He was repeating what someone else said from another ethnic position. I was in Africa for 9/11, and I never feared for my life as an American anywhere in the world except for during that season. Serving in Africa for those four years, I was able to view the United States through the eyes of someone else other than American media. I found the BBC, the Chinese news, you know, all the other countries \u2014 Italian news or French news or Spanish news service \u2014 you know, able to hear what they said about my country. And, in fact, you have a totally different picture of your home when you see it through other eyes and you\u2019re watching the media, you\u2019re watching American media covering the same issues and the same story. I was going, \u2018Wow. This is very subjective.\u2019 OK. I said, \u2018Ooh, this is not objective at all. This is very subjective.\u2019 So on the one hand, you know, it\u2019s like let us entertain you. And then on the other hand, this is what you have to be afraid of today. OK. So prophetic preaching is the opposite of entertainment. Ah, you\u2019re not going to let me talk about this, are you? [Laughter No, no. I am. I am. But what I want to \u2014 OK. If you want to come back \u2014 if you think I\u2019m derailing you, don\u2019t let me. But what I was going to say is what felt inflammatory when people heard sections of Jeremiah Wright\u2019s sermons on YouTube and really things taken out of context, it was that combination of seeing things in a different way, but also the anger and the righteous indignation \u2014 righteous indignation \u2014 that is part of the prophetic tradition. And it was that passion attached to the idea that maybe America was morally culpable in the large sweep of history and maybe there was some connection between that and bad things that were happening to us now that struck a really emotional nerve in the American psyche of something being almost anti-American. So what did you want people to understand about that kind of preaching and that kind of theology? Well, I have to come back. I have to come back. Yeah. OK. OK. You know, I\u2019ve got to come back and say that from any pulpit in America, whether the preacher is black, white, Asian, yellow, blue, pink, or green, whatever color, you will hear somewhere some strain some of criticism or opinion about America. You will hear it. I hear it when I go through the channels and I listen and I listen and I listen, you know, and I hear a preacher say, \u2018You vote for those who believe in your values.\u2019 Or you switch the channel and you hear the preacher say, \u2018Now we\u2019re going to support our troops \u2014 right or wrong!\u2019 OK. Here\u2019s this opinion here. You hear a variety of things, not just in the black church. You hear a variety of opinions that support a particular political line, a political bent, you know, a political thing. It\u2019s not just in the black church. I\u2019m saying it is in all churches. OK. What happens in America is we have an opinion that we can\u2019t do anything wrong, that everything we do is right. Mmm? We as a culture. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you think? What do I think? Yeah. I\u2019m a journalist. You know I don\u2019t have any opinions. Yeah. Right. Ms. Tippett: When Americans hear those kinds of opinions in the pulpit, the other kind of opinion, that we support our troops, right or wrong, that sounds patriotic. Now, what I hear you doing is being patriotic in a sophisticated and complex way. And I think you\u2019re still saying that in the pulpit, it\u2019s appropriate to point out that everything is not perfect with American democracy. I mean, you know, so take what you just said to me and tell me what is the place for that kind of analysis in the pulpit and in preaching and how that comes together with this prophetic tradition. Well, the prophetic tradition is one thing. If you\u2019re talking about social criticism and whether social criticism has a place in the preaching tradition, yes. Does political criticism \u2014 I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking now \u2014 whether political criticism belongs in the pulpit. I think you\u2019ll find a lot of opinion that says, \u2018No. We preach Jesus Christ, him crucified and risen from the grave. You know, that is our mandate. That is the gospel ministry.\u2019 But to be silent about what\u2019s happening in your neighborhood, is that sin? So for me, if I\u2019m in my neighborhood \u2014 let\u2019s say I\u2019m back in Baltimore. I\u2019m at Payne Memorial. I\u2019m the pastor and I have 5,000 people who cannot feed their families, and I look up and I\u2019ve got another 5,000 coming, because they\u2019re being dropped out of a system, then I\u2019m supposed to be silent? And not pick up the phone and call my council representative or my mayor and say, \u2018This is what\u2019s happening in my neighborhood. What can we do together to fix this? Because in a minute, it\u2019s getting ready to be out of hand.\u2019 OK. And they tell me, \u2018Well, we made these decisions months ago and years ago.\u2019 And I said, \u2018But you made these decisions and you expect me to feed these people and take care of them and be a part of the safety net system. That means now you\u2019re impacting my budget \u2014 my tithes and offerings, that are going to go from our people to help fix this problem that you created \u2014 and didn\u2019t bother to consult me. So you want me to shift my budget to be a part of the safety net, because we\u2019re going to do that anyway. You know, we\u2019re going to demonstrate the love of God in a very tangible way, but I\u2019m supposed to do that silently and not ask questions to see how we can make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u2019 Bishop Vashti McKenzie. The lens of black theology, as Vashti McKenzie said, is influentially explored in the writing of James Cone of New York City\u2019s Union Theological Seminary. Here is James Cone being interviewed earlier this year at the Trinity Institute of the Episcopal parish of Trinity Wall Street in New York. Now you come to this, reading the Scriptures, the same Scriptures that the dominant white church read. How can people read Holy Scripture so differently? How do you read the Scriptures? I read the Scripture from the bottom. That is, I read the Scripture from the vantage point of the weak, the poor, and the helpless. I think that\u2019s the dominant theme in the Scripture. I think you\u2019ll see that in Amos and a lot of the prophets. I think you see that in the Exodus, that symbol. I think you see that in the story of Jesus\u2019s life. And certainly in the Cross. I think you have to read the Scripture through the eyes of those who are marginal, weak, helpless in this society. But I know everybody doesn\u2019t read it that way. And the people who don\u2019t read it that way are usually the people who are already on top. They are the advantaged. Now there are many voices in the Scripture and you have to choose. What the Scripture doesn\u2019t do is self-interpret. You have to make a choice. I choose by looking at the Scripture from the vantage point of the Cross, a violent event. An event in which the helpless Christ Lord is hanging there. I think that is closer to a lynched black victim than it is to somebody who is sitting up in some mansion somewhere. Watch that entire interview with James Cone on our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CAfrican-American, Woman, Leader: Meeting Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie.\u201D I want to ask you a similar question to the one that I asked at the beginning of this, talking about Jeremiah Wright. There was a point in the primary campaign, and this is when I started thinking about wanting to interview you, where there was suddenly \u2014 it was like the notion of being a woman leader, being an African-American leader, somehow there was a competition between the two in a sense. You know, which would be best? And I started thinking about Vashti McKenzie who is an African-American woman leader and how you hold those qualities together in yourself. And I just want to ask you also how you experienced some of the dynamics that were raised about gender and about race in that primary period. How you personally took that in. What disturbed you? What did you feel we weren\u2019t really addressing head-on? Well, I still feel that there is still more emphasis on whether one is black or whether one is female and that our focus should be upon the issue, the program, the platform, the track record, and then again the things that need to be done to look ahead. I mean, we have issues that need to be dealt with and they need to be dealt with effectively, not only for our future, but for our children\u2019s future. We have a domestic policy that is kind of ragged here, and we already know what\u2019s happening on Wall Street\u2019s stock market. Yeah. Our government is bailing out the financial system here, private financial organizations, to keep it from getting worse, but then you wonder who\u2019s going to bail out the American government. You begin to wonder is America for sale. And these are very tenuous times in our country, and we\u2019re all hoping for the best and the better. So we should not be focusing on whether one is a female or whether one is African-American. Let\u2019s focus on what they say, what they say they can do, what the policy can be, how can they perform. That should be the focus. I live for the day. I\u2019ve said over and over again. I live for the day when my gender and my race means nothing \u2014 means nothing \u2014 about whether I\u2019m qualified to do a job or perform a task; that my gifts, my skills, my character, my mental astuteness, these things is what gets me in the door. Not whether I\u2019m female or not whether I\u2019m African-American, not whether I\u2019m from the Asian Pacific Rim, not whether I\u2019m Hispanic or Latino, but my gifts, my skills, my graces, these things qualify me to do the job. Period. You often write about, you know, leaders who happen to be women. And I can imagine you also, leaders who happen to be African-American or happen to be Latino. Right. Mm-hmm. You know, when the ship is sinking and you\u2019re going down for the third time, OK, you know, somebody\u2019s getting ready to cast a net to say, \u2018I can pull this ship out of the water and all of you will live,\u2019 are you going to stand there and take time and say, \u2018Are you African-American? You know, what\u2019s your heritage? What\u2019s your parentage?\u2019 Right. You just want to get saved. You want to live. You want to get out of the rough waters here. You don\u2019t want to drown. You talk a lot in your books about it\u2019s important for you for people to think for themselves about what are societal defining moments for them, and I\u2019d just love to know what your perspective is, you know, in these years we\u2019re in now. Because I have the feeling you may not give the obvious answers. You know, what are the societal defining moments that you see, that you\u2019re experiencing, that are going to shape us as we move forward well beyond, you know, this year, this presidential election and the crises of today? I think that you\u2019re referring when I talk about defining moments, things that happen so that things are different after that moment happens. They have impact upon your life, so that how you were living prior to it was changed by that moment, so that you live differently after that. Like certainly for me the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a defining moment for me. And I think in this era, this election, whoever wins, it\u2019s going to be a defining moment. I believe that because there\u2019s so many young people \u2014 hooray, hooray, hooray \u2014 who have been content to let other people make decisions for them, who are waking up and who are working and volunteering and getting excited. And there\u2019s going to be one group that\u2019s disappointed, and my fear is that they will just throw up their hands and walk away and that they\u2019re unable to handle it. I would hate for that to happen. I would hope that whichever side, whatever it is, that they would use that disappointment to continue to participate and to work and to volunteer and, of course, to vote. This is a most exciting time to be alive in the world. We are right on the cusp of moving into new directions. We are learning, moving from this industrial age to this information age, which is changing all of our relationships. And I think the church is the last place where we\u2019re going to learn how to relate to each other as human beings. You mean it\u2019s the last place \u2014 it\u2019s one of the last places where that is what we focus on; is that what you\u2019re saying? Yeah. Yeah. Where it\u2019s taught. Where it\u2019s preached, where it\u2019s taught, where you learn it, where you\u2019re in Sunday school. We don\u2019t do it in school anymore. Yeah. It\u2019s inter-generational, too, in churches. Yeah. Absolutely. On how we relate to each other. But for me, I remember very vividly my dad \u2014 big guy, 6\u20194\u2033, 200-pound guy, you know, AAU track champion out of the University of Wisconsin, big guy \u2014 you know, you daddies are always the little girls\u2019 hero. And I vividly watched my dad watching the dogs and the hoses released on people who were in the Freedom Marches down South with tears coming down his eyes. And I was a little girl, and he turned to me and he says, \u201CNever let anybody ask you what you did for your people and for your country.\u201D And so I never want my children to ask me, \u201CWhat did you do?\u201D I want them to be able to see it. And I hope every adult who is living and alive today will be able to do something to improve where we live and who we are so that when you turn around and hand this world to your children, you will not be ashamed.

And on our staff blog, SOF Observed, we\u2019re looking to you for ideas, everything from how we might explore the ethical and moral boundaries of our developing economic crisis to suggestions for music on an upcoming program on revenge and forgiveness. Scientists are exploring how and why revenge and forgiveness are biologically driven instincts. They are in our DNA. My guest in that program says that if we better understand our capacity for revenge then we can nurture our capacity for forgiveness. We\u2019re looking for your stories of revenge, of forgiveness, and of what you\u2019ve learned in your experience of them both.
