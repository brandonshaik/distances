  "fullText": "\u201CA dysfunctional family is any family with more than one person in it.\u201D That\u2019s vintage Mary Karr, the poet and writer of salty and lyrical memoirs like The Liars\u2019 Club and Lit, in which she traces her harrowing childhood in southeast Texas with a mother who once tried to kill her with a butcher\u2019s knife and her own adult struggles with alcoholism and breakdown. Mary Karr is captivating in writing and in person for her ability to give in to what is funny and wild in life\u2019s most heartbreaking moments. And she embodies this wryness and wildness in her lesser-known spiritual practice as a devout Catholic \u2014 an unexpected move she made in mid-life. I started praying. I got on my knees. I mean, even I, after whatever 35 years of agnosticism \u2014 when you land in a mental institution, you have to say to yourself, \u201CMy ways of moving through the world are not succeeding.\u201D But I remember thinking at the time \u2014 asking this woman what she prayed for. She said, \u201COh, I pray every day for a joyful day that\u2019s full of serenity.\u201D Like, really? [laughs] Right. You can pray for that? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Mary Karr lives in New York and is a professor of English literature at Syracuse University. So you may know then that I start my interviews by wondering about the spiritual background of someone\u2019s childhood. And clearly, your spiritual background was not religious. And in fact, the stories that you\u2019ve told in your memoirs that so many people know have to do with a childhood that was awash with a lot of violence and chaos \u2014 not only violence and chaos, but plenty of that. But if you think about what was the spiritual canvas kind of in and amidst that inside you \u2014 and I\u2019m sure you would answer this question differently at different points in your life \u2014 but how would you think about that now? A lot of terror. Yeah. It was a lot of terror, and fear, and suffering, and loathing, and self-loathing. The great thing about a really miserable childhood is the rest of your life looks like you\u2019ve improved things. Right. When really, all you\u2019ve done is grown up and gotten car keys and a credit card, you know? But you feel like you\u2019ve made some great advance. And you have said, \u201CPoets were my first priests, and poetry itself my first altar.\u201D I think that\u2019s right. Did you think of it that way then? Or do you think of it that way in hindsight? I think I always sort of did. It would make a lot of sense to Freud. I mean, it was the place I had contact with both my mother and my father is around language, in a way \u2014 my father\u2019s stories and my mother\u2019s love of literature. Yeah, which strikes me, as somebody who grew up in that part of the world kind of, as really unusual that your mother had that love of language. I mean, you talk about being able to calm her down or draw her out of a sulk by reciting e. e. cummings or A. A. Milne. But that\u2019s amazing to me. I know, right? Yeah. No, she was a marvel for that place and time. And so, yeah. I mean, it was \u2014 what would I have had to be? I don\u2019t know \u2014 a hooker, a serial killer, a poet. I mean, that\u2019s kind of the lineup. Right. I heard your interview with Terry Gross, and I was so intrigued as you talked about your religious life now. And then when I started rereading you and reading The Art of Memoir, reading some of your newer works and Lit, it seems to be also, even \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I want to go here immediately \u2014 but that there\u2019s a sense in which many of the ways you talk about writing memoirs, there\u2019s a spiritual discipline to that. I think that\u2019s true. I think that\u2019s really true. I mean, in an age when even to use the word \u201Ctruth\u201D or even to say the word \u201Ctruth,\u201D it always comes now with finger squiggles around it, comes with quotes around it, as though, \u201CHow dare one presume to know the truth?\u201D But I believed that one could. I believed that \u2014 I guess for me, having such complicated feelings about my much-loved fairly troubled family, I just felt like I had to figure out what had happened and why I felt so bad, or I just wasn\u2019t going to make it. So the idea of trying to kind of even believing that there was such a thing as truth and that it could possibly in any way be knowable by a person through self-reflection, and therapy, and talking to people, and fasting, and prayer, and eventually talking to Jesus, that there had to be some way of \u2014 I believed that that the truth would set me free. I believed that. \u2018Cause, as I said, I was lied to so often and with such conviction by such really talented liars or just some really able artists. Well, and the people who were supposed to be actually teaching you the truth about life, I mean, in a perfect world, right? Right. I mean, we\u2019re all lied to by our parents. Yeah. That\u2019s it. I mean, let\u2019s face it. We\u2019re all lied to, either intentionally or not intentionally. But again, in an alcoholic family, I think you start with that big lie \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m not drunk.\u201D I mean, you\u2019re just told that so many times. Or, \u201CEverything\u2019s OK.\u201D Those are the two big ones in a family where there\u2019s a lot of hard drinking. People are always saying, \u201COh, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s going to be OK. No, everything\u2019s all right.\u201D \u201CBut last night you were wagging firearms in our kitchen, Mom. I mean, come on.\u201D And again, my mother was a seeker. I mean, she went back to college when I was a kid, and she studied philosophy. She spent a lot, probably too much time for somebody as moody as she was, with the French existentialists. And she did yoga. Nobody did yoga. Wow, wow. I mean, I guess all readerly people are seekers, aren\u2019t we? I mean, is that not true? Yes. And also attending to interior life, which is not necessarily such an American thing to do. Right. It\u2019s very unseemly. Yeah. It\u2019s very unseemly. I mean, I think of \u2014 Josh Shenk has that great book, I think, called Lincoln\u2019s Melancholy about Lincoln\u2019s depression and about the kind of \u2014 and I think, again, the blessing \u2014 I can see it now that I\u2019m not in it, but the blessing of a really depressive early life and a really \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t think my childhood \u2014 there are plenty of worse childhoods \u2014 but I think it does deepen you to be dark-minded, I think. Yeah, and if it doesn\u2019t kill you, right? If it doesn\u2019t kill you, it does \u2014 and it gives you a lot of, I think, if you\u2019re lucky or if you come out of the other end of it, it also brings you to compassion, I think, for other people. So there\u2019s this phenomenon that you write about in yourself and also in your students that when people first start writing, they\u2019re often actually not writing about the person they really are. And you had this\u2026 Always. Always? You had this epigraph from Thomas Merton to The Art of Memoir, which is just a poetic way of saying \u2014 he said, \u201CEvery one of us is shadowed by an illusory person of false self. I wind my experiences around myself and cover myself with glory like bandages in order to make myself perceptible to myself and to the world as if I were an invisible body that could only become visible when something visible covered its surface.\u201D But then we don\u2019t even know how to express that true self? Well, we don\u2019t know what it is, mostly. I mean, I think when I\u2019m at some point \u2014 and I think this comes from trying to meditate over a period \u2014 I still think of myself as a rank beginner \u2014 but over a period of decades, I\u2019ve been trying to do this. And if in those moments of terror or judgment of other people or of myself or thinking I know things I don\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, when I first got sober I had this sort of \u2014 Virgil, this kind of spiritual guide through the hell of early sobriety who would say to me \u2014 when I would tell her something I was afraid of, she would say, \u201CWhat is your source of information?\u201D And 99 percent of the time it was, \u201CI thought it up.\u201D OK. I had all kinds of magical thinking. And so I think, for me, the process of trying to become curious in those moments of real discomfort about what\u2019s going on, it doesn\u2019t always free you from suffering, per se. But I don\u2019t know. I have a girlfriend who\u2019s a mother with young children, and she called me one day to tell me she had lost her mind, and she was incapable. She needed to call the police and check into a mental institution because she had slapped one of her children who was little, I mean, 5. But she said, \u201CNo, no, you don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t stop crying. I can\u2019t stop crying. I\u2019ve apologized. I just really think I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201D And I said to her, \u201CWell, who\u2019s noticing that you\u2019re losing your mind?\u201D Right. \u201CAnd second, how did you get here?\u201D \u201CWell, I haven\u2019t slept. I\u2019m working full-time. I\u2019ve got two kids. I haven\u2019t eaten.\u201D I was like, \u201CYeah, OK. Well, maybe have a sandwich,\u201D you know? \u201CI mean, maybe it\u2019s time to have a sandwich.\u201D But just, for me, the voice of God never gives me a long-term plan. It never helps me with any kind of lottery number or anything. But that voice that says, \u201CYou need to sit down and have something to eat, or it\u2019s not going to be good to be you anymore.\u201D And so just in that noticing self that that also is you, is God connected to that? Is God in that somehow for you or close to that? I think not only is that also you, I think that\u2019s the real you. I think that\u2019s the real you, and the frightened angry self is often an animal self. And that\u2019s us too, obviously. I\u2019m not trying to say that the devil made you do it, and that you\u2019re somehow cut off from those other aspects of how you feel and behave. You\u2019re responsible for all of it. But yeah, I think, for me, coming to have a place inside myself or my spiritual practice, or going to mass, or taking communion, or trying to be more mindful, or praying, just really trying not to kill everybody on the subway every day \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the goal for me. It\u2019s not lofty. I don\u2019t want to be Mother Teresa, you know? I don\u2019t want to be an asshole. I can\u2019t say that on the radio, can I? What else can I say? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the poet and memoirist Mary Karr. You spoke in a similar way in this book Now Go Out There, actually, and the kind of subtitle is And Get Curious, which was a graduation speech, right? Taken from a commencement address? Right. Yeah, can you believe they gave me an honorary degree? I mean, I\u2019m so undegreeable but they\u2026 Yes, I can actually. Yes, I did. It was so fun. It was really fun. I dreaded it. I\u2019ve never dreaded anything more than that graduation speech. Why? I mean, I\u2026 Why? There had been a huge uproar that they were even having me be the commencement speaker because there had been a rumor on campus that it was supposed to be Jimmy Fallon, which was, like, a complete lie. But you ask, \u201CDo you want, like, the local poet or old maid school teacher, or do you want Jimmy Fallon?\u201D It\u2019ll be Jimmy Fallon every time. So there were, like, protests, and people wrote the chancellor and said, \u201CCan\u2019t we afford a real graduation speaker?\u201D This is terrible. \u201CDo we have to have this person?\u201D No, it was terrible. It was a huge thing on the internet around Syracuse, like, how awful this was and that I was going to be the commencement speaker. And so my level of anxiety when I was working on the speech \u2014 and then, as I often do, once I\u2019ve worked on a talk, I just \u2014 at some point, you have to just let go of the outcome, and you say, \u201CLook, if they boo and they throw things, it\u2019ll last for 20 minutes. And then it\u2019ll be over, and I\u2019ll have an anecdote. It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll go back to my life.\u201D Yeah. I mean, in Now Go Out There, you said, \u201CThe opposite of love is fear,\u201D and you told these graduates that \u201Cfear can take that expensively educated brain of yours and reduce it to the state of a dog growling over a bone.\u201D But you did say, \u201CAsk yourself who\u2019s noticing how scared you are,\u201D and that that\u2019s where your soul is, and if you can get curious about it, you get less scared, which is\u2026 I think that\u2019s right. Yeah. I mean, if you can just sort of see these scary events as kind of practice to notice what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s interesting because most of that feeling that you have so often when you\u2019re terrified, it really is the same feeling our Neolithic ancestors had when the saber-toothed tiger was bounding out of the \u2014 I mean, you feel like you\u2019re going to die. I mean, the feeling people have when they\u2019re heartbroken or they\u2019re terrified is, \u201CI\u2019m going to die. I will die from this grief. I will die from this fear.\u201D And if you can wake up into it, and look at it, and just sort of say, \u201CWell, yeah, I\u2019m going to feel this way for X amount of time. What\u2019s causing this?\u201D Yeah, and something I like about the way you talk about getting real or getting in touch with your true self is also \u2014 you\u2019re proposing very gentle ways in. Like, you\u2019re not saying analyze it or interrogate it. You\u2019re saying just noticing, getting curious \u2014 those are soft actions. They\u2019re much closer and easier to get at than attacking a problem, right? But it\u2019s also one\u2019s instinct if you are afraid\u2026 Yeah, if you\u2019re anxious. \u2026is to make it stop. Right, right. If you\u2019re afraid, if you\u2019re anxious, if you\u2019re angry, if you\u2019re heartbroken, one\u2019s instinct around it is usually violent. And that interior violence is so \u2014 I mean, the problem with being judgmental, says one of the most judgmental people on the planet, is that the voice you use to criticize everybody else is the exact same voice you use to criticize yourself with. So, yeah, if we could just walk around in our separate little bubbles throwing lightning bolts at people who got our parking places or got ahead of us in Starbucks \u2014 yeah, I suppose. But there is something about trying to find a gentler way to respond to what normally makes us feel, or makes me, anyway, have a violent reaction, which is, \u201CGet me out of here,\u201D or \u201CGet me away from this,\u201C \u201CMake this stop.\u201D If you can find a way to occupy it, I think you find yourself saying true things. I remember when I first met my agent \u2014 and I was a young writer, and I wanted so desperately to have an agent, and to write a memoir, and be able to buy a Toyota, you know? Yeah. Like, that\u2019s what I wanted was to be able to buy a used car and not have to take public transport to my kid\u2019s after school. And I just remember her saying to me, \u201COh, you should write a memoir. And I was like, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201D And she says, \u201CWell, you just write a proposal and send it to me.\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a poet. I don\u2019t know what that would look like.\u201D And I would never have said that. Instead, I would have faked that I knew what she was talking about and then, as the date came when I was supposed to give it to her, I would have found a reason not to do it, or to get drunk, or to not show up, just not even try, in a way. Before you met her, before you really embarked on this career of writing or maybe even really saw yourself as a writer, you pretty much \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 there\u2019s somewhere that you note the connection between breakdown and breakthrough. Right. Is it a nervous breakdown or a nervous breakthrough? Yeah. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s a good question. \u2018Cause you had both, right? Well, I think every nervous breakdown is a nervous breakthrough if you let it be. I really do. I really believe that. I believe that it\u2019s the old Hemingway saying of all of us are broken, and some of us get stronger in the broken places. Yeah. I mean, here\u2019s something else you said. You called the place you went the \u201CMental Marriott.\u201D It was. In this graduation speech, which is now this book, Now Go Out There, you wrote, \u201CThe loony bin is where I learned that as deep as a wound is, that\u2019s how deep the healing can be.\u201D Right. Yeah, I mean, if you think of it that way, however high the fever is that you have, when it breaks, you\u2019ve come that much further forward. And the sense of resilience one has, I think \u2014 I mean, I\u2019d spent my whole life \u2014 my mother was in a loony bin when I was little, and I spent my whole life thinking, \u201CI\u2019m going to go crazy like my mother.\u201D And then my kid was, I don\u2019t know, 3, and I went crazy like my mother. And there I was checking into a mental institution. It was such a relief. I was like, \u201CNo,\u201D but I got there. And it was a lot of co-dependent nurses asking me how I was feeling, and trying to make me little cups of tea, and sitting around rooms with people, moving your Monopoly tiles real slow. I mean, it was a restful, quiet place where I got to say, \u201CYeah, it\u2019s hard to be me. It\u2019s been hard to be me, everybody. Remember I was saying that before? Well, here we have external evidence that I might not be up to it.\u201D Yeah, and the word \u201Cquiet\u201D actually comes up a lot when you\u2019re writing about that time. And there were a lot of hard things you were having to face. Your marriage was failing, but in quite a few places, you used the word \u201Cquiet.\u201D And here\u2019s this one place I think you say that, there, you started to write differently, that \u201Cthere was a polished quiet around the writing,\u201D which is such a lovely image. I think I just got that idea of trying to say something small and simple and as true as possible. Yeah. Really, in some ways, starting to write about what I wanted to write about when I was in the fourth grade. I mean, I had that journal from 1965 \u2014 so I was 10 years old \u2014 where I say, \u201CWhen I grow up, I will write one-half poetry and one-half autobiography.\u201D And what else do I say? I say, \u201CI\u2019m not very successful as a little girl. When I grow up, I will probably be a mess,\u201D or something like that. And instead of trying to act like I knew what was going on, to write as if I were a mess, which is how I felt. There just felt like there was less posing to it. I mean, obviously, when you write anything, you\u2019re constructing a voice, and you\u2019re constructing a self, and there\u2019s artifice to it. You\u2019re trying to make the sentences sound more interesting than you are in your normal life. But I did feel like I got closer to who I really was at some point, and I stopped trying to sound like Nabokov, say, and started trying to sound like \u2014 who\u2019s this genius\u2013 and started trying to sound like this aborigine from east Texas. A couple weeks ago I was with \u2014 do you know Sylvia Boorstein? She\u2019s a Buddhist teacher. She\u2019s wonderful. No. She\u2019s on the West Coast. And I did just some sitting with her, and she introduced this concept, which seemed so radical to me, which was about, not so much having a mantra or even following your breath, but about sitting and just kind of noticing, taking in the natural peace and ease of your mind. OK, I know, and that\u2019s how I felt, right? Because\u2026 You\u2019re like, \u201CThe natural peace and ease of my mind?\u201D Right. Well, so \u2014\u00A0and that was such a crazy \u2014 just is such a foreign idea to me. But then, if you think about it that way, like, if you think that all the noise and all the chaos actually is something you\u2019re doing, that it wasn\u2019t there, it was not preexistent, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. And I was thinking about that as I was reading you and reading you about being at the Mental Marriott and what settled \u2014 it feels like you started that natural peace and ease of your mind, which you\u2019d never been allowed to experience, was present to you, in a way, or at least, I think, in moments, right? Well, I started praying. You started praying, yeah. I started praying. I got on my knees. I mean, even I, after whatever 35 years of agnosticism \u2014 when you land in a mental institution you have to say to yourself, \u201CMy ways of moving through the world are not succeeding.\u201D You know? I\u2019m in custodial care. People won\u2019t let me have sharp knives. There\u2019s a reason that people are looking at me with concern. But I remember thinking at the time \u2014 asking this woman what she prayed for. And I would pray to stand it. I would pray to \u2014 \u201CLet me get through a day. Let me just get through this day without killing myself or anybody else.\u201D And I remember this woman saying \u2014 I thought of that when you said she \u2014 I said, \u201CWhat do you pray for?\u201D She said, \u201COh, I pray every day for a joyful day that\u2019s full of serenity.\u201D [laughs] Like, really? Yeah, right. You can pray for that? Tell me another one, yeah. Well, so what happened when you \u2014 I want to know what happened with Sylvia Boorstein when you started\u2026 Well, OK. So once she told this story \u2014 which to me, also, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about \u2014 which was, about 20 years ago, she was watching Larry King interviewing a swami, some kind of wise man. And Larry King, after talking to this man for a while, he leaned forward, and he said to him, \u201CHow did you get it so quiet in there?\u201D And the swami said, \u201CIt is quiet in there. We make it noisy.\u201D So I\u2019d been thinking about that for a couple of days, and then comes this morning where she says, \u201CAll right.\u201D She said, \u201CToday, all I want you to do is just kind of feel the natural peace and ease of your mind.\u201D And it was \u2014 my story is different from yours, but that\u2019s not even something I ever probably wanted or thought would be interesting, for one thing, right? Well, right. It sounds boring. Yeah, it sounds boring. But it\u2019s actually there, right? I mean, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I couldn\u2019t hold it for more than a few minutes but\u2026 It\u2019s up in there? Yeah. It\u2019s up in there? It is? That quiet, that peace and ease, well, it\u2019s elemental, right? It\u2019s like all the layers are on top of it, but seriously. Those descriptions you have in Lit, of then your marriage is troubled, but even in the midst of that, you\u2019re taking it in differently, right? Yeah. I love that. I mean, I love that thing Thomas Keating says about practicing mindfulness, and that it\u2019s sort of like \u2014 there\u2019s a bunch of water that has mud and silt in it, and the longer you practice, the more that just kind of settles to the bottom, and you don\u2019t feel any peace. You might practice for days and weeks, and it\u2019s just cloudy and noisy. And he says what you don\u2019t realize is that healing is happening, that that stuff \u2014 by doing that, you are settling it, but you don\u2019t notice it because it hasn\u2019t settled yet. You have to just \u2014 how difficult just to keep sitting there. Yeah. Yes. And unfamiliar, right? Oh, yeah. Right, \u2018cause I would rather snort cocaine and make out with the FedEx guy. Yeah. Right. Yeah, right? Yeah. You can listen again and share this conversation with Mary Karr through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the poet and memoirist Mary Karr, who\u2019s beloved for her books like The Liars\u2019 Club and Lit. Less well known is the way writing, for her, is a spiritual practice. The story of how you \u2014 that kind of falling apart and, I think, becoming spiritually awake \u2014 and I don\u2019t know whether you would have called it that or not \u2014 and becoming a writer, and then also in that same chapter being baptized in the Catholic church at 40. Well, yeah. I mean, that was some years after that. OK. I think I was in the bin in 1990, so it was maybe six years later. So I\u2019d been practicing, I\u2019d been meditating and praying for four or five years before my son came in in his little Spiderman pajamas and said, \u201CI want to go to church.\u201D And I said, darkly, \u201CWhy?\u201D And he said, \u201CTo see if God\u2019s there.\u201D Which is kind of the only sentence he could have said that would have got me up off my butt away from The New York Times and that bagel and into a church somebody told me we could go to, you know? Yeah. You made this kind of public confession of your Catholicism in Poetry Magazine in 2005, and you write about how poetry always seemed intellectually respectable where religion wasn\u2019t, right? Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, being a Catholic is like being, you know\u2026 Right. \u2026oh my god. It was shameful. Yeah. So confessing your Catholicism in Poetry Magazine was\u2026 Oh yeah. It was anathema. I mean, that\u2019s where T. S. Eliot first published \u201CPrufrock.\u201D That\u2019s where all the dark and French-influenced symbolistes for the past century blazed a trail into existential misery. I mean, for me to come in and be Catholic \u2014 oh my god, it\u2019s bad enough being a Texan, and then a redneck, and then not educated, and then this just proved out all my detractors, you know? OK. Here\u2019s what you wrote. \u201CTo confess my unlikely Catholicism in poetry feels\u201D \u2014 I think we can put this on public radio \u2014 \u201Cfeels like an act of perversion kinkier than any dominatrix could manage on HBO\u2019s Real Sex Extra.\u201D [laughs] I forgot I wrote that. Gosh. How dare I? But there is such \u2014 what\u2019s the word I want to use\u00A0\u2014 I mean, poetry and prayer and liturgy are so much of a piece, right? I mean, they\u2019re so kindred to each other and\u2026 I mean, I remember when I first went to the Catholic church, which I did \u2014\u00A0I took my son; he was the one who wanted to go to church. And I sat with a stack of papers and graded them in the back. I had a latte. I\u2019m not even making this up. I brought a latte. I sat in the back and\u2026 Wow. \u2026he was in Sunday school, and I was just cynically there marking time. And something about the faith of the people \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the spectacle, or the \u2014 Walter Pater and all those esthetes always talked about the grandeur, and the ritual, and all the gold stuff, and all of that \u2014 none of that I cared about. I mean, I care about it more now maybe just \u2018cause I\u2019ve gotten used to it, but at the time, I was kind of repelled by it. But just people saying their prayers, people saying, \u201CPlease pray for my daughter who\u2019s having surgery,\u201D people bringing hope and terror into a public forum and saying, \u201CI\u2019m afraid, and I need these things to happen in order to go on.\u201D And isn\u2019t that what poetry is? I mean, poetry is that place where the most disturbed among us try to find the most exalted language to convey those hopes and those despairs or that desperation. I\u2019m curious about, as a poet and a writer, if there are parts of the scriptural text or passages that inform you, or that you work with, or that you get inspiration from. Yeah. I mean, I read the liturgy every day. You do? Oh, yeah. It\u2019s so cornball, isn\u2019t it? I read the liturgy. And, yeah, I mean, my favorite psalm is the hanging psalm. I think I write about it in Lit. I found it in my mother\u2019s childhood Bible marked in blue chalk. Oh, yes. Right. Such a beautiful psalm, \u201CCleanse me with\u201C \u2014 is it his hyssop? Whatever the hell it is \u2014 \u201CWash me, and I\u2019ll be whiter than snow. Take away my stone heart, and give me a new heart.\u201D I mean, what is that but saying, \u201CMake me present.\u201D Yeah. And I remember that part in the book where you\u2019re kind of discovering those passages underlined in your mother\u2019s young hand. Her little bitty baby hand from, like, 1930 or something, and then me finding it in, like, 1999, \u201998, whatever it was. I know, right? I want to read this from St. Augustine\u2019s City of God, which you put at the top of one of the chapters in Lit, where you\u2019re talking about becoming religious. \u201CLate have I loved you, O Beauty, so ancient and so new, late have I loved you. For behold you were within me, and I outside; and I sought you outside and in my unloveliness fell upon those lovely things which you have made. You were with me, and I was not with you. I was kept from you by those things, yet had they not been in you, they would not have been at all. You called and cried to me to break open my deafness and you sent forth your beams and you shone upon me and chased away my blindness. You breathed fragrance upon me, and I drew in my breath and now do pant for you.\u201D Isn\u2019t that great? I got chills when you read that. \u201CAnd now do pant for you.\u201D Good old St. Augustine. Boy. Yeah. Probably our first sex addict, right? That\u2019s right. Well, and actually\u2026 Yeah, that was my favorite line of his \u2014 \u201CGive me chastity, Lord, but not yet.\u201D Right, which is a good segue to something else I wanted to ask you about, which is your notion of sacred carnality in The Art of Memoir. It\u2019s a little bit of a stretch from St. Augustine being the first sex addict, but I do love that language. And talk about what you are thinking when you talk about sacred carnality in The Art of Memoir . What I liked about the Catholic church that I didn\u2019t find, say, in the Protestant tradition, there\u2019s a body on the cross. Yeah. Even just being in mass that you stand up and kneel down, that you move in unison, that I know a lot of cradle Catholics complain about how sheep-like you feel, or they\u2019re like dumb cattle or something like that, but I sort of found it \u2014 it\u2019s like being in hip hop class. When you move like everybody, you kind of feel like you are like them. And the idea that we\u2019re hunks of meat incarnate \u2014 in meat, that it\u2019s not metaphorical, the idea of Jesus and the Eucharist. It\u2019s not a metaphor that you\u2019re going to be renewed. It\u2019s not a metaphor of his body or his \u201Cteaching,\u201D quote-unquote, or his love or whatever. It\u2019s his body. It\u2019s so lurid. And I remember looking at the body on the cross and saying to my son that \u2014 I don\u2019t even remember whether I ever wrote about this or not \u2014 but I remember looking at it before we were baptized and saying, \u201CI don\u2019t get this whole crucifixion thing. It\u2019s so awful. I mean, the suffering, beaten critter nailed up there is just so gross. Why don\u2019t they just have you say the jump rope rhymes, and then you\u2019re redeemed?\u201D And my kid, who was young, like, maybe, I don\u2019t know, 8 or 9 said, \u201CWho would pay attention to that?\u201D Right. And he said, \u201CThis is like Pulp Fiction.\u201D My mother, the one time I left him with her, had let him watch Pulp Fiction when he was, like, 7 years old. And he said, \u201CThis is like Pulp Fiction. It\u2019s just like \u2014 everybody is going to gawk at this.\u201D Right. And then I suddenly thought, what else would we pay attention to as human beings but this grizzly, awful, morbid thing? You\u2019re not going to look at that and say, \u201COh, you don\u2019t know about suffering. You\u2019re God. What do you know about suffering?\u201D You\u2019re going to look and say, \u201COh, you were a hunk of meat like me. Wow.\u201D That\u2019s a radical \u2014 that idea of descending theology of the spirit being in these hunks of flesh, it\u2019s \u2014 wow. It\u2019s a big deal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the poet and memoirist Mary Karr. We talked a little bit about truth when we started speaking a little while ago and what a kind of troublesome concept it is for modern people, whether there\u2019s any such thing as truth. And as a memoirist, the truth that you\u2019re remembering at any given moment is shifting depending on who you have become, right? What you can see. Right, right. We\u2019re talking about something that is \u2014 I mean, even the incarnation, especially the incarnation, is, on the one hand, the most literal concrete elemental image you could have, but it\u2019s absolute mystery too. But in Catholicism, it\u2019s in the realm of truth. So I wonder if you have conversations about things like this with people who aren\u2019t religious but who are very sophisticated and intellectual. And both. Yeah. I\u2019ve done both, but I remember before I did The Ignatian exercises, which I did, like, probably around 2000, \u201898, it was all very metaphorical for me. Yeah. It was all very groovy kind of new-agey. Resurrection was starting over in some kind of hippy-dippy way. And in Ignatian spirituality there\u2019s a thing you do where you compose a scene with your body with all the senses that composes \u2014 the way St. Ignatius writes about it, it\u2019s like, if you\u2019re at the nativity, if you\u2019re at the crucifixion, what can you smell? What do you touch? What does the cloth feel like on your skin? What do you hear? What do you feel? You try to put yourself bodily \u2014 using your senses into passages from the scripture. It\u2019s a very powerful practice to take a passage from a scripture and try to ask the Holy Spirit to put you somewhere, to place your mind and your senses in another place. I mean, it\u2019s a very radical, dangerous kind of prayer to make, and I did this over 30 weeks and they give you a lot of different methods of prayer and somewhere in there all of the stuff that had been metaphorical became very actual for me. The idea of my sense of Jesus \u2014 I didn\u2019t like Jesus when I became Catholic. I came in on the Holy Spirit. And then I got that sense of Jesus that \u2014 I just noticed that the people who are always running the soup kitchens, and taking care of the babies from El Salvador, and bringing in orphans, doing all the good stuff, and who don\u2019t seem really angry and crazy and kind of pissed off and really pious \u2014 they seem kind of realistic \u2014 always talked about Jesus all the time. So I thought, \u201CI\u2019ve got to get on this Jesus boat. I\u2019ve got to get with this Jesus program.\u201D And somewhere in there, I just found that I was able to practice it. Do I doubt? All the time. Sure, there are days that I wake up \u2014 I mean, to me, being a Catholic is like any spiritual practice. It\u2019s a practice. It\u2019s not something you believe. It\u2019s not doctrine. Doctrine has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s a set of actions. Yeah. Everybody talks about the doctrine. Do you believe in this? Do you believe in that? What do you do on a day? Do you get on your knees? Do you try to practice charity? Do you try to apologize for your mistakes? Are you trying to live a life that is less shameful than the one the day before? Right, right. You know? So I think that idea of sacred carnality comes in again that you\u2019re talking about embodied truth, which is apprehended and lived and\u2026 How are you going to act? I mean, people talk to me all the time. I\u2019m friends with Phillip Roth, who obviously doesn\u2019t believe in God, but he said \u2014 he\u2019s 83. He talks about dying. He said, \u201CWell, it\u2019s easy for you. You\u2019re 60, you\u2019re Catholic, you believe in this afterlife.\u201D Yeah. I\u2019m like, look, I don\u2019t think the veil is going to be lifted, and I\u2019m going to be flying through the air with a harp with my mommy and daddy. I mean, I do believe there is something that happens after death. I don\u2019t know what it means, and it\u2019s not my business. It\u2019s not what I\u2019m supposed to be thinking about right now. I\u2019m just not in charge of that. I\u2019m having a hard enough time just getting through the day. So, for me, it\u2019s all about practice and practicality and trying to be awake. And that means getting under that fear and anxiety. I mean, for me, being Catholic or having a meditative or spiritual practice is all about just trying to be guided by something bigger than the part of me that wants to French kiss my FedEx guy, you know? [laughs] I mean, it just does. I need help. I need help, Krista. So you\u2019re so hard on yourself in your writing. And all across your writing, you describe yourself as a neurotic, nail-bitey \u2014 that\u2019s a big adjective \u2014 worrier. I\u2019m a worrier. I\u2019m a fretter. Yeah, a fretter. And I mean, even what you just said \u2014 you\u2019re so attentive to the struggle of being alive and, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s say being true to whatever your true self is. But I do wonder \u2014 and I guess I ask this kind of hopefully \u2014 let me say this \u2014 I think, as somebody who reads you, it\u2019s hard to read how hard you are on yourself, right? So\u2026 Oh, but can I say, I think I\u2019m less hard on myself than I was even when I wrote my last book. Well, that\u2019s what I wanted to ask. I wanted to ask if \u2014 as you get older, if you\u2019re becoming kinder to yourself. I\u2019ve got to tell you I would not trade the age I am now. I would not be younger. I would not be a week younger than I am because I do feel \u2014 you can\u2019t be compassionate to other people unless you\u2019re compassionate to yourself. You can\u2019t love other people unless you love yourself. Unless you have empathy for yourself and your own suffering and your own peccadilloes, you\u2019re not going to have it for anybody else. So, yeah, I mean, it took me a long time obviously to come to that, and I go in and out of it. But I have a lot more presence and a lot more joy. I eat a lot more chocolate. I don\u2019t know. I mean, my head is a lot quieter after all of this, you know? The 30 years of prayer, the insobriety, the 20 years of being Catholic. I marvel and wonder a lot. I think I spend a lot of time kind of astonished by the human comedy, the hilarity of it, and the beauty of it, and just the simple nobility of most people trying to get by. It\u2019s a pretty thing to watch. The last line of The Art of Memoir, you write, \u201CNone of us can ever know the value of our lives or how our separate and silent scribbling may add to the amenity of the world if only by how radically it changes us one and by one.\u201D You were writing to other people but that speaks also to the fact that, even as you do that work you\u2019re doing on getting by, being better \u2014 trying to be better today than yesterday \u2014 there is also this social good. There are these larger ripple effects that get set in motion, even by something \u2014 I mean, this is kind of a great mystery of life, even by something like writing memoir about the very particular world in which you grew up, the very particular parents you had. Right, what Faulkner would call your \u201Clittle postage stamp of reality.\u201D Yeah, I think it\u2019s \u2014 one thing I say to my friends who are atheist, I say, \u201CLook, why don\u2019t you \u2014 you think I\u2019m so full of horse dookie. Why don\u2019t you pray every day for 30 days and see if your life gets better.\u201D And my guess is that it will just because if you think \u2014 I mean, let\u2019s say there\u2019s not a God. Let\u2019s say I die, and there\u2019s not a God, and the worms eat me, and that\u2019s the end of it. Daring to hope every day \u2013 it\u2019s much more radical, I think, to hope than to live in the despair I was born to. I think it\u2019s much more dangerous. I remember asking Tobias Wolff when he saw his movie of This Boy\u2019s Life, that great memoir, \u201CWas it hard to watch?\u201D I watched it. I sat behind him, and his family and his mother was there. And I said, \u201CBoy.\u201D I said, \u201CI cried.\u201D I said, \u201CThat was so hard for me. Was it hard for you to watch?\u201D He said, \u201COh, it was really hard.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat was the hardest?\u201D And I was thinking when his step-father is beating him, and he\u2019s a young Leonardo DiCaprio. He said, \u201COh no, that didn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201D He said, \u201CIt was the hope. It was when we\u2019re singing Christmas carols thinking, \u2018Oh, this is going to be great,\u2019 and we have this awful, awful family.\u201D Right. And it\u2019s much more radical, much more daring, and much more dangerous to hope. I think you\u2019ve said similar things that it\u2019s easier to write about those terrible, dramatic moments and harder to write about tenderness. Oh, yeah. Those tender moments. \u201CHappiness writes white\u201D is the de Montherlant quote; it doesn\u2019t really show up on the page. Well, I feel like you\u2019ve said this in a number of ways, but I do want to just kind of ask as we close how you would start to put words around this vast question of what this sweep of your experience as a memoirist with the life you\u2019ve lived as a poet and just as a human being, how you would start to talk about what you\u2019ve learned or are learning still about what it means to be human, maybe that surprised you as you\u2019ve gone along. There\u2019s more joy than I knew. And the less scared I am, the more joy there is. The less in my head I am, the more south of my neck I live my life. The more awake I am, the more just simple joy there is. People always talk about the sunset and all that. I don\u2019t get any of that. I have zero feeling for nature, but just watching the old lady with the walker on my way to the studio get off the bus in front of me, and just watching how it was just so heroic. I was just looking at it thinking, Homer wrote about this. I mean, just somebody struggling to move down the damn road with all this effort all by her little ancient self. Good for her, you know? It was just pretty to watch. Mary Karr is the Jesse Truesdell Peck Professor of English Literature at Syracuse University.
