  "fullText": "All right, Krista. Me and you, kid. Where\u2019d you go to school? Well, I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma and then I went to Brown which was a very strange move. My wife wrote a book titled \u201CThe Right Words at the Right Time\u201D. What did somebody say to you at one point in your life that changed your life? You could write your own or you could have someone write for you and you had, of course, final cut. Or you could be interviewed. And I did two. I did Muhammad Ali and I did Ted Turner. And Turner\u2019s, as I recall, was a professor at Brown. He had a professor who taught the students to think outside the box. Did anyone ever interview you and ask you that question? I wrote one. Yeah. About yourself? Yeah, an incident, an incident. About your own moment? What was yours? Are we on the air here? Yeah . Phil Donahue\u2019s pioneering daytime talk show launched in 1967. He had a front row seat on the world so many of us are now reliving through Mad Men. I watched the Phil Donahue show when I was growing up. But it wasn\u2019t until I looked back at his work that I realized how substantive a lens it was on an entire era of social, personal and political transformation. His very first guest was the controversial face of public atheism, Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair. He engaged the emerging world of militant Black leaders. He presented a \u201Cgay man\u201D to his audience as a human being. Above all, Phil Donahue\u2019s choice of guests and topics respected the intelligence of the housewives of his audience, who themselves were in a coming upheaval. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I met Phil Donahue at the 2013 Nantucket Project on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. At 77, he still has the full handsome head of gray hair for which he was always recognizable. He\u2019s still married to the actress Marlo Thomas, who he memorably met in public on his own set. Phil Donahue grew up in a big Catholic family in Cleveland, studied at Notre Dame, and got into radio before he wandered into television. And that was the backdrop of the answer he gave to that question about a turning point of insight. I was covering a mine disaster in Logan, West Virginia for a local television station at which place I was employed in Dayton, Ohio. and I\u2019m like 23 years old. I must have looked 19 or 12 and I don\u2019t know if you can appreciate what it was like for me to be covering for CBS radio. I think there were like 28 miners trapped. And, oh, yeah, they wanted this. So we used to have to \u2014 it was snowing and we had to keep the camera warm so that the oil didn\u2019t freeze. Otherwise, it would screech. And we were by the smudge pot which is what the miners gathered around when they would come out of the mine. They would work in shifts trying to reach their brothers who were trapped. And the snow is falling and the miners with, you know, the soot on their faces would gather around the smudge pot and pray for the survival of their friends who were trapped. And I remember the song, the hymn, they sang was \u2014 I can only remember part of it \u2014 \u201CWhat a friend we have in Jesus, everything to God in prayer.\u201D And the sparks flew in the air, the snow was coming down. It was the most beautiful, humble tableau of faith and religion I\u2019d ever seen and the preacher would, after the singing, would say, \u201CDear God, we are gathered here on this mountain and we ask your blessing on these miners and their families. Please help us rescue them, dear Jesus, in your name we pray. Amen.\u201D And I realized that we hadn\u2019t filmed this. And I went up to the preacher and I said, \u201CReverend, I\u2019m Phil Donahue from CBS News and we didn\u2019t have a chance to film you and we very much would love to get this on film so that we can send it to CBS News.\u201D And he said, \u201CWell, sir, I\u2019ve already prayed to my God and it just wouldn\u2019t be right to do this a second time.\u201D And now I\u2019m begging. Right, right. \u201CReverend, your prayer will be seen in taverns.\u201D At that time, TV was mostly in bars. \u201CAnd the American people will see the power of your faith in your prayer.\u201D \u201CNo, sir, I have already prayed. I\u2019m sorry. This would not be true to God\u2019s word and His truth and my truth and the truth of these families.\u201D Well, I went down to \u2014 the telephone company had put up some payphones for the media and I got in that payphone and I closed the door, I dropped a quarter in, called collect to CBS News in New York. I mean, I\u2019m holding this phone. I could see my knuckles were white and into the phone, I said, \u201CThe son of a won\u2019t pray.\u201D And I think it must have been maybe a week or two \u2014 I\u2019m a slow learner really, suddenly after we had gone home and I think they lost most of the miners. I don\u2019t think anybody was saved. And, of course, I couldn\u2019t get this out of my mind and I realized that I had been witness to the most beautiful demonstration of moral courage I had ever seen in my life. And I put the story in Marlo\u2019s book and, you know, it called to my attention the Pharisees and the Publicans \u2014 I forget which was which. The Pharisees, I think, go up to the altar and they say I am here, Lord, I love you, Lord, and I am here. Right, right. They put their faith on display. Yeah. Yes. And the pomp and grandeur of some religious personalities in our nation who would have no trouble throwing holy water again, if one of the stations missed it, at a plane accident or whatever, you know, to get on TV. And this humble cleric \u2014 I\u2019m sure he was Protestant \u2014 would not pray again. He had already prayed. And did that imprint you as a \u2014 I mean, clearly it imprinted you on a human level, but did it influence the trajectory of your work in media? Well, this was at a time when I was really becoming a little more questioning. Because you had had a very serious Catholic upbringing. Very serious. Yep. My mother would say there are two kinds of Catholics. There\u2019s a Catholic and there\u2019s a good Catholic. I never quite understood what was the difference, but my mother apparently knew. I was a good Catholic. Of course, I never missed Mass on Sunday. Our family went every Sunday. And this would be \u2014 I was early 20s, so this would be not long after I graduated from Notre Dame. I entered Notre Dame, you know, thinking that I had the answers to all the questions and I graduated from Notre Dame realizing that not only didn\u2019t I have the answers to all the questions, but the questions were now more exciting for me. It was like I was free to question things that I had never \u2014 we did have a very liberal priest at the time at Notre Dame and the subject matter just thrilled me. We could read books on the Index. The lndex was a list of books that Catholics were prohibited from reading. Oh, wow. And it was just a thrill, like a vicarious thrill. I remember reading Immanuel Kant, \u201CProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysic\u201D and I used to tell that to girls that I was dating, you know. Yeah, I\u2019m reading \u201CProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysic\u201D, you know. Was that attractive? Did it\u2026 ? As I recall, it didn\u2019t work that much, you know. I still don\u2019t think any of them kissed me goodnight, which was about as warm as you got in the 50s. I graduated from college in 1957. Right. You know, I was a virgin when I got married. I obeyed all the rules and then suddenly, you know, I began to see Catholics voting for Nixon in the 60s, supporting the Vietnam War. And my wheels started to turn, you know. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with daytime talk show pioneer Phil Donahue. You know, the show you did in the era, in those years in which you created that show, I mean, one thing that I \u2014 so I watched your show, right? I mean, I was born in 1960. And you turned out anyway, huh? By the way, my show was born in 1967. \u201967, yes. So, I mean, in my growing up years, right? So one thing as I knew I was going to interview you, I understood better what partly what was so unusual that you innovated, which was pure talk without entertainment, right? And it actually struck me as I was looking back at some of it and also looking at what you\u2019ve been doing more recently. And \u2014 you know, what you were doing, what you were drawing out of people and for this American audience was this exploration of the human condition as it relates to society and politics. And those were wild years for the human condition. They were wild years for society and politics. Why was Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair your first guest? Because I knew she was compelling. We had a very boring show visually, two talking heads. Which was unusual then, right? Which was unusual then, right? Which was unusual then, right? Oh, we were competing with other shows. \u201CCome on down\u201D with spinning wheels and people screaming and Monty Hall was giving away $5,000 to a woman dressed like a chicken salad sandwich, \u201CLet\u2019s Make A Deal\u201D. And here I come with two talking heads. The industry didn\u2019t understand us at all. And we were in Dayton. Stars were not available to us. So I knew that the only way we could survive would be issues, something that would compel the viewer. And did you know that at the outset? Did you understand that that\u2019s what \u2014 you had to make the issues vivid? Yes. Remember, I had come from a radio show where I could have the guest long distance so that pretty interesting guests didn\u2019t have to \u2014 nobody\u2019s gonna fly to Dayton, Ohio to be on a radio show. And I had interviewed Madalyn on the show and, religion, I just was fascinated with. I am now and I was then, especially coming from Notre Dame and the, you know, the \u201CProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysic\u201D, because my own head was starting to change. And the devil, as it would be known then, was tempting Phil Donahue, of all people, 16 years of Catholic education and the devil was saying why are these religious figures so interested in publicity and wealth and why do the wealthiest people in the parish get entree to the pastor that the common people do not? And it\u2019s probably hard for people to even remember how controversial an atheist \u2014 a prominent atheist like Madalyn O\u2019Hair was in the 1960s. Absolutely. Right. It was the worst you could be. It was right there with gayness. Of course, we put a gay guy on\u2026 I know. In November of 1967. \u201967. Yeah, before Stonewall, over a year before Stonewall. But also, just that, like that, right? You put a man in the chair who was a gay man and that was this specimen of something. I was like \u2014 I mean, I was scared to death, \u2019cause I felt they\u2019re gonna think I\u2019m gay and, you know, nobody was out in 1967. Did you use the language of gay? Was that the language or was it homosexual or\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a good question? I don\u2019t remember. The language is so evolving so rapidly now. I just can\u2019t get over it. I got a call, an email, from a young man in Michigan or somewhere in Wisconsin, I forget. And he said, \u201CDear Mr. Donahue, I heard you say on Oprah that you put your first gay guest on in 1967. I think that is my uncle who has passed and do you have a tape?\u201D I wrote him back and I said, \u201CWe didn\u2019t know we were gonna be The Donahue Show in 1967.\u201D And I said, you know, \u201CVCRs may have existed then and someone may have taped that somewhere, but I regret I know of no copy of that program. But I would like you to know that I think your uncle was as powerful a demonstration of moral courage as I\u2019d ever seen and I also think the program rises to the level of historic because nobody else was acknowledging gayness.\u201D What was the reaction? Well, pretty severe. We lost sponsors, mothers thought their children would catch it if they saw it. Why are we aggrandizing this man? To put him on television makes him look like he\u2019s a hero or something. Just disgust. And thank God we had a general manager who didn\u2019t drop his tools and run. He stuck with us and one of the reasons he did was that we had a tremendous rating. Everybody was watching The Donahue Show. And in my business, the coin of the realm is the size of the audience. So, you know, that was my trump card. We were drawing a huge audience. This general manager, it wasn\u2019t easy. It would have been much easier to cancel us. It would be much easier to run reruns of I Love Lucy. We were on the air at 10:30 in the morning. There was all kinds of product out there that could have \u2014 and a lot less trouble. You know, this was the first month we were on the air. We premiered on November 7, 1967 with Madalyn. There is no God, there\u2019s no heaven, there\u2019s no angels. When you die, you go in the ground and you biodegrade and you become part of the physical universe. Well, my dear, you know, the whole town of Dayton fell down and the letters came pouring in. But I don\u2019t want to overstate it. Dayton is a town that\u2019s built on a \u2014 the river that runs through Dayton, the Miami River, is not navigable. It\u2019s a town built on brains starting, of course, with the Wright Brothers. The viewers in Dayton accepted our show, by and large. Certainly, certainly we took our hits. People pushed back and I had salesmen from my station outside my office doors, you know, who weren\u2019t interested in a speech about the First Amendment. They just lost Roger\u2019s Pontiac, you know, and they had kids too and a mortgage. But somehow we survived all that. And the other thing that you did that I think there was a lot of awareness about at the time \u2014 I mean, one of the things you were doing is you were broadcasting to a lot of women who stayed at home. Yes. And most women of a certain class stayed at home at that time. And you were assuming that they had brains, right? You were presenting \u2014 you were putting a lot of subjects and complexity on at that time of the day. It\u2019s amazing to realize how sexist the world was and certainly my industry was. Women cared only about covered dishes, needlepoint, babies and maybe home decoration. And we came barging in with all these issues, including war and peace and protest. But you were pretty traditional also, I think, in your first marriage. I mean, I did get your memoir that you wrote way back then out of the library. And you describe yourself also has have coming out of that world that in fact was shifting. Absolutely. We rode the feminist movement, the gay rights movement, the antiwar movement. We put tie-dyed t-shirt kids on with long hair and this is in the late 60s who were protesting the war. We had a woman on whose daughter was a student at Antioch College and she was in the Green County jail having been arrested at a demonstration and fasting to end the war. And the women in the audience were saying, well, what if she dies? And the mother would say, why aren\u2019t you concerned about the 300 young men coming home from this horrible war in Southeast Asia in plastic zippered bags? Why don\u2019t you care about that? And then another one would say, well, I do care about that, but this is your daughter. I couldn\u2019t get them to \u2014 and we had something that no one else on television had. But sexism reigned. It was a huge issue at the time and what we did was, you know \u2014 feminists would come into the show and they would say children get too much mother and not enough father, and they were talking about me. And were you having that experience in real time? Oh, sure. In some way, it\u2019s like you had this front row seat on the 1960s and 70s. I did. And you were able to like invite the whole cultural negotiation into the seat across from you. I would wish this good fortune on anybody I love. It was a wonderful experience. I had every issue on a platform that had my name on it. And to this day, people come up to me in airports. \u201CThank you, Mr. Donahue. Because of your show, I got out of an abusive marriage.\u201D \u201CThank you, Mr. Donahue. Because of your show, I came out to my parents.\u201D A woman told me the other day at 10:30 every morning, her mother would put on her lipstick and go into another room and close the door and watch The Donahue Show. So we became kind of appointment television and especially for seniors, you know, older women. And we did shows with feminists who would say out loud, \u201CI don\u2019t want to live the life of my mother.\u201D And you\u2019d have people calling in, \u201CI\u2019m not a feminist, but\u2026\u201D and then they\u2019d proceed\u2026 Now that\u2019s what younger women say, again it\u2019s come full circle in a different way. Yeah. And then were you \u2014 you know, were you aware that this was changing you? Were your views of women changing? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to say. Certainly somewhere along the way, I thought, you know, Dad gets up and has a leather suitcase and goes off in the car to the building downtown and Mom goes in the basement to do the laundry and what this was doing to children, girls especially. And then legislation began. Girls\u2019 sports became an important issue for high schools. So interesting to think about that not having been around. Really. It\u2019s really amazing and the drama continues, the tension continues. Is it right that you put an abortion being performed on the show? Yes, we did. And then you invited the archdiocese and a number of people to discuss it? Yes, and we showed them the film. And that was at 10:30 on the weekday morning? Now we aired in various times around the country. OK, but it was a regular show. It was that day\u2019s show. Well, we taped the abortion. Yeah, right. And then, before we put it on, we called the people from the archdiocese. They came, we put them in a room and showed them the tape. And, of course, when it was over, I walked in the room and they were weeping and they were very concerned, because it looked so easy. I said, well, this is the procedure. And it\u2019 s so easy that more people will get them. And I said, you know, this is an issue that is splitting families. You can listen again and share this conversation with Phil Donahue through our website, onbeing.org. There you can also subscribe to our podcast. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org.Although it is now a standard of every daytime talk show, Phil Donahue pioneered the audience-participation format. He was the first host to ever go out into the audience, making them part of the conversation. Here are some moments from a show he did in 1979, with Atlas Shrugged author Ayn Rand. I want to change the topic and go back to something you said about industry. Fifteen years ago I was impressed with you books, and I sort of felt that your philosophy was proper. Today, however, I\u2019m more educated and I find that if a company \u2026 Excuse me, this is what I don\u2019t answer. Well wait a minute you haven\u2019t heard the question yet. She has already estimated her position and my work and incidentally displaying the quality of her brain if she says today she is more educated. I am more educated now than I was fifteen years ago when I was in high school since before I went to college and read the newspapers . Let her make her point, let her make her point. I will not answer anyone who is impolite, but \u2026 She wasn\u2019t impolite. You are equating someone who disagrees with you with impoliteness. That\u2019s not fair. Coming up\u2026Phil Donahue on his personal transformations on race, gender roles, and parenting in the dramatic era he captured on television. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with broadcaster Phil Donahue. His show was the original daytime talk show focused on issues, and he was a pioneer in audience participation. Oprah Winfrey has said there would have been no Oprahwithout Donahue. We\u2019ve been discussing his remarkable lens on the social and political dramas of the late 20th Century. He\u2019s recently guest hosted for Bill Moyers, and had a stint on MSNBC. Here\u2019s an interview he did in 2002 with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Thousands and thousands of people\u2026 Yes. Come to hear you speak, and I think I understand why. You speak to their anger. And, you know, it\u2019s not possible to argue against the anger. 2,000,000 people in jail for every 100,000 people in prison \u2014 35,000 are black, 1,100 hispanic, and 462 are white. When I hear you speak to these injustices, to these, you know, racial profiling \u2014 New Jersey state troopers. Honestly, if I think I were a black male I\u2019d be at Randall\u2019s Island listening to you speak. I would. You know the political power that you have is undeniable. But you make it tough on the white reporters \u2014 with all this history of this kind of rhetoric, it\u2019s awful tough to say, \u201Chey Minister. Farrakhan sit down tell us how horrible we are.\u201D We have to challenge you as you would challenge us. This isn\u2019t a game, this a matter of the respect that we want to have as professionals. You can\u2019t get up there and talk like that as a man of God, using language like you do. So I am asking for some understanding here \u2014 you bring this on yourself. It was just so honest and we don\u2019t have honest public discussions in media or elsewhere. I think I scolded him for not being respectful of Jewish mothers, for example, Jewish parents, devout Jews. You know, he called it the dirty religion. This was back when he was really quite offensive and I decided to challenge him on his absence of Christian empathy for the feelings that he was wounding deeply of Jewish people and others who lived their life around a faith. So I do remember that part and I do remember saying that, you know, I get it. I\u2019ve heard him speak, you know. \u201CYou don\u2019t know your name!\u201D he would say to a black audience, that their names were given them by white people, you know, Washington and Jefferson. And I recall being struck by the power of that and that I had never thought of that. But, you know, race, for example, is something that we now bemoan right and left that we don\u2019t know how to talk about even with a black man in the White House. I know that you resist being asked to be the person saying we did it so much better in the olden days, right? You don\u2019t like to be in that role. But when you watch \u2014 I mean, you\u2019ve talked about war in recent years in a way that got you into hot water. But when you watch how we talk or fail to talk, to have the cultural reflection we need to have about something like race, you know, could you say how you might like to \u2014 how we might start it in a different place or does your mind go there? On race or something else? Maybe there\u2019s something recently you\u2019ve seen and you\u2019ve thought I wish I could start the discussion here instead of there or weigh in in this way? Mm-hmm. Well, isn\u2019t that an interesting question. A lot of people, a lot of my friends, you know, we bused our kids to a Catholic school downtown to downtown Dayton. And I remember I went there the first time. The plumbing leaked in the little boy\u2019s room and the paint was peeling. And in my suburban neighborhood where we lived, they had overhead projectors, they had pictures of Martin Luther King in history books in suburban Centerville. And in downtown Dayton, there would be an of Cardinal Spelling and the pages were turning yellow. Everything was different downtown and we felt that Catholics were raising another generation of racists and we didn\u2019t want that to be on our children. I began to realize what paternalism was too. I was on the board of \u2014 it was called the Dakota Street Center. I remember very well that in the meetings of the board, the white guys did all the talking and I noticed that. And then I remember when we needed furniture, I said, well, why don\u2019t we go to Goodwill and one of the black board members said, hell, we give stuff to Goodwill. And I began to appreciate what paternalism was and how the white man will solve everything and a failure to respect the views even among the committed which we certainly were. The enlightened, yeah. And, of course, everybody in my own neighborhood, suburban Centerville, became convinced that we were gonna sell our home to a black family. So, you know, we went through that stage and I came to realize that there were really four \u2014 there were stages to commitment, you know. The first stage was the fun stage. You got a kick out of marching and it was also a messianic stage. Everybody was a bigot but you. You turned people off. And then the third stage was a sudden overwhelming realization of the awesome challenge of the problem, that it was the Rock of Gibraltar and you were the feather. And that\u2019s, I think, where the saints were made, people who kept on keeping on. I saw so many people just, you know, fabulous people to this day. They cared, but they did become exhausted. And a lot of people chose, you know, to fulfill this wonderful commitment that they stopped having. They took guitar lessons or yoga. And did we kind of get stuck there culturally? Some of us did, yes. And, yes, a lot of us are. The issue is hard to raise if it\u2019s not immediate. Remember, this is a time when my first year on the air, Bobby was assassinated, the cops beat up the kids in Chicago, Martin Luther King was assassinated. Holy cow, this is the first year we were on the air. And I made sure that our staff was integrated. I remember I hired the first black applicant, a female, and I\u2019m embarrassed to say \u2014 I mean, one of the reasons I hired her is because she had the biggest Afro. But, I mean, this is one of the stages, you know, that we went through, or I did. You know, we were trying. You know, I think even there\u2019s something refreshing and helpful about you recalling things in that way because right now here in the 21st century there are a lot of problems which seem so huge. I mean, you look back at the 60s as a very fraught, you know, terrible time, but a time in which incredible social shifts happened. And that kind of shift is kind of unimaginable now and it\u2019s not going to happen the same way. You\u2019re kind of describing this like human wearing down, this very gradual, incremental. Well, you know, sooner or later \u2014 black people saw the deterioration of their school system. They saw police brutality aimed at them and not white people. They saw joblessness. They saw their father pushed around by cops. And pretty soon, the cities exploded. And I think about that now. The gap between the rich and the poor has never been greater and getting wider. And I say to myself, how long can this continue without that explosion? So in some ways, I think it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to make a better metaphor. I wonder if we aren\u2019t right now sitting on a powder keg especially on the matter of the horrible maldistribution of wealth, and the comfortable don\u2019t really talk too much about that until suddenly they\u2019re afraid to go downtown, because there are people in the streets. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: Phil Donahue. Going back to that memoir you wrote in the 80s, I believe. \u201978. The very first line of it, the very first words are \u201CIf I could start parenthood over again.\u201D It was really striking to me that that\u2019s where you began and, at that point, you were a huge celebrity. You know, your show was a huge phenomenon and you started it with your regrets about parenting. Well, I came to realize, like so many others too late \u2014 too soon old, too late smart. We were raised at a time when people thought the worst thing you could do was spoil your children, you know. Kids have to know that life is tough and it\u2019s filled with challenges and you have to make them tough, blah, blah, blah. It was like they were clay and you had to knead \u2019em and push \u2019em and create\u2026 Right. Spank \u2019em. Yeah, spank \u2019em. You know, I came to feel pretty guilty about this, again, guilt. On those occasions when my children pleased me, I didn\u2019t say so. And now when I walk to Starbucks in the morning in New York City, I see mothers with their babies, some of them in a tram, stroller, and I see them, you know, kissing their babies. I love you, honey, you little baby. You\u2019re so precious to me. And I thought to myself I never did that. And you see fathers doing that too now. And\u2026 And you see fathers doing it too. And fathers, yes. And I think to myself why didn\u2019t I do that, you know? And why wasn\u2019t I more \u2014 it\u2019s such a more enlightened time now. Parents are more enlightened. Certainly, we have too many children today growing up without that kind of attention. So another reason for me wanting to start over again. But, you know, my kids all talk to me, so I\u2019m\u2026 Do they? Yeah. I want to ask you as the Catholic in you, what do you think of the new pope, of Pope Francis? I mean, you\u2019ve been Catholic a long time and you actually did a show on Catholic clergy sexual abuse. When was that? In the mid 90s? Very early, with my mother watching. With your mother watching. Well, I don\u2019t know Pope Francis. You know, I admire the first step he\u2019s taking. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t live up in the grand large rooms of the papal residence in the Vatican. That\u2019s a good thing. Let\u2019s not overdo it. But, you know, pope or no pope, the treatment of gay people in traditional Catholic teaching is itself a mortal sin. You know, if the church believes they\u2019re sinners, it makes it easier for me to beat them up. Have you, over the years, developed a sense of God that is in contrast to that doctrine and theology that has come to make you so \u2014 that you\u2019ve really rejected? That\u2019s come to be so uncomfortable? Well, Alfred Lord Tennyson speaks for me . Lord Tennyson. I\u2019ve gone from Immanuel Kant to Lord Tennyson [laughs]. It\u2019s hidden in a poem titled \u201CThe Memoriam\u201D which you can look up. Here\u2019s what he said. \u201CThere lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.\u201D I read that and I thought, wow. I wish I\u2019d roomed with you in college. You must have been interesting. And like, you know, I\u2019m dangerous. I have a little knowledge. So that\u2019s my little peek into Alfred Lord Tennyson just as I had only a glancing blow to \u201CProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysic\u201D. Kant, yeah. But that speaks for me. I used to have fights with Madalyn all the time. Madalyn O\u2019Hair, yeah. I would say, \u201CMadalyn, you cannot tell a person that you\u2019re absolutely certain there is no God and then, in the same breath, tell me that you\u2019re absolutely certain\u2026 That they can\u2019t be certain there is a God. Yeah. It\u2019s a contradiction. You can\u2019t do that. So agnosticism may be the only honest route here and keep your mind open. I mean, I am impressed with the universe. I look up at night and I go wow. You know, we can\u2019t fathom this, their distances. The fact that every little pinpoint up there is a sun, a sun, except for our planets. They\u2019re all suns. Carl Sagan said that on the air one day and I thought, wow, I never thought of that. On your show? Uh-huh. So, you know, the order, the orbiting, the novas and the great swirls that the new photography is bringing down to us, beautiful. The horsehead nebula, the sombrero, and there are things up there that just fascinate. And that the light that we\u2019re seeing now left, what, 1000 years ago. I mean, that\u2019s how long it took light to get here. Whoa! It\u2019s hard for me to believe this is an accident. But I\u2019m having more and more trouble dealing with a commanding God \u2014 I\u2019m having more and more trouble dealing with original sin. I\u2019m not even asked to be born and I\u2019m born with sin? I\u2019m born with a sin? But if you don\u2019t have that sin, then what do you do with Calvary? And, of course, I\u2019ve been recently attracted to Sam Harris and\u2026 Have you? I was just wondering. I was just thinking who would be guest on your show now with this line of inquiry? Oh, him, for sure. I think you\u2019d have a lot of physicists on now too, some of the new physicists. Right. You know, but it\u2019s funny. Physicists lean more toward the possibility of a God than the life scientists do. Well, they have a rich vocabulary of mystery, which is kind of what \u2014 or wonder, which is what you\u2019re describing. And, you know, I\u2019ve come to know and really admire Ed Wilson, E. O. Wilson, of Harvard, the entomologist and sociobiologist. He\u2019ll pick up a bug or maybe an ant and he\u2019ll say this is a masterpiece. And, you see those legs all in unison propelling the main body forward, the swivel head, the antennae, there\u2019s a brain in there, such as it is, a brain managing these various body parts. And the more I get into it, and somebody said to me \u2014 these are all things that have come to me so late \u2014 you can take a Magellanic voyage around the trunk of a single tree. Oh, man. Now I know why I was so filled with wonder as a child when I was in the woods and saw that dappled sunlight and the brook and the water rolling over rocks and the sound it made and the things that scooted and skittered when I lifted a rock. And it\u2019s only very recently, much later in life, that I realized this can be studied. We don\u2019t know all the answers here. As a child, I just thought that\u2019s what it was, you know. Who made you? God made you. Sit down. I wasn\u2019t encouraged to study it and that\u2019s why the young people today have moved into the natural sciences and go out and get their socks wet walking through woods and their little notebook, you know. I\u2019m so impressed with these people. They\u2019re gonna save us all. I think what you\u2019ve modeled is study by conversation, you know, inquiry into daily life too. So I want to thank you as somebody who\u2019s doing my part in that lineage. Well, thank you. It\u2019s a real honor to meet you. A pleasure, and believe me, there are many people out there who can carry this ball and, I mean, throw back answers that will just, I think, be a thousand times more inspiring, informed. You know, the people who got smart early, those are the people you want to talk to. Wow, they\u2019re fascinating. I ought to know. I\u2019ve met several of them on my own show. OK. Thank you. Thank you, Krista. Phil Donahue\u2019s daily talk show, \u201CDonahue,\u201D aired from 1967 to 1996. He now writes and guest hosts, and produced and directed the documentary film, Body of War."
