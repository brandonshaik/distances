  "fullText": "When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the area of man\u2019s concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses. This is how Follow, Poet, the new album by the composer Mohammed Fairouz, begins. He\u2019s been called a \u201Cpost-millennial Schubert.\u201D He\u2019s composed four symphonies and an opera while still in his 20s. And he\u2019s as passionate about statecraft as about art, so he invokes John F. Kennedy and Anwar Sadat, Seamus Heaney, and Yehuda Amichai in his compositions. He weaves poetry, even enduring political speech, into his music as a form of music too \u2014 and a way, just maybe, to shift the world on its axis. I think that music and poetry, the arts, do something that is very, very special in that they allow us access to a rarefied space, a sacred space almost. They take us beyond the 9/11s, beyond the Tahrir Squares, beyond Facebook and Twitter and all of this stuff. They allow us to reach beyond the day to day. They allow us to reach beyond the muddled present and in a way to touch something that is timeless and eternal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. With Follow, Poet, Mohammed Fairouz is the youngest composer to record a full album for the august century-old Deutsche Grammophon label. Among his many commissions, he\u2019s written pieces for Borromeo String Quartet, Imani Winds, and the violinist Rachel Barton Pine. Mohammed Fairouz, who is first-generation Arab-American, was born in New York City in 1985. I read somewhere that you were \u2014 you began composing music at a very early age. And I read somewhere that you were setting the poetry of Oscar Wilde to music at the age of 7. Is that right? I\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s a song on a poem by Oscar Wilde that is called \u201CThe True Knowledge.\u201D And it\u2019s a beautiful poem. I took a stab at it when I was 7. And I have to admit, I didn\u2019t understand the poem at all. But I gave another go at sort of trying to revive it. I revisited it in, I think, 2002 or something as an early piece and tried to fix it. And I\u2019ve since stopped doing that because I realized that as a composer, we leave very important traces of who we are spiritually in the pieces that we compose. And so it\u2019s actually best not to tamper with who you were ten years ago to be who you are today. Accept and perhaps even try to love who you were ten years ago. And be kind to yourself. But also look forward to who you want to be in a year. That\u2019s lovely. I wonder if \u2014 I asked you if you \u2014 it seems like you began composing at an early age. And you were also always \u2014 and you\u2019ve used this language of being obsessed with text. And I just wonder, how do you \u2014 where do you trace the kind of source or spark of these intertwined passions for you in the background of your life, in your early life? Well, I think that one has to be obsessed with text in order to take it seriously. I mean, obsession is such a healthy thing. And for a composer, for an artist, for a human being, for a poet, for a diplomat, being obsessed with something is absolutely essential to getting what you want to get done done. And I guess I should say something about that because whenever I look back at innovative personalities, whether it\u2019s Mozart or Steve Jobs or Shakespeare or Benazir Bhutto \u2014 whoever it is, they always seem to have that very \u2014 when you\u2019re reading about them, when you watch them speak, when you listen to their music, whatever, when you read their speeches, you always register a sort of obsession. There\u2019s something obsessive about what they\u2019re committed to. And I think it makes for an extraordinary \u2014 at least an extraordinary commitment in what you\u2019re doing. So being obsessed with text, Krista, is about diving into the text, accepting the text, opening your emotional pores to the text, and not simply treating the text as a dead, intellectual document. You\u2019re also, in a way, accepting it as part of your life. Right, right. And that may be something as old as Dryden or Shakespeare or as new as Mohammed Hanif. It\u2019s imperative to be obsessed. And was there a spiritual background to your childhood that also reinforced or kind of helped plant your love of text? And just \u2014 there\u2019s such a \u2014 there\u2019s this poetic, aesthetic sensibility, kind of a fulsome, well-rounded complete sensibility that\u2019s there in your work that I actually also find very much in the fabric of Islamic culture, these winsome things like connections between spiritual life and love poetry. Or even you\u2019ve talked about that calligraphy \u2014 that for you, there\u2019s kind of a resonance between this treasured art of calligraphy when you\u2019re writing musical notation. Do you know I\u2019m saying? I feel like you kind of embody this aesthetic sensibility that\u2019s not so well known about Islam. Well, I\u2019m \u2014 yeah. I\u2019m very saddened that it\u2019s not so well known because, in a way, the Qur\u2019an itself literally translates as \u201CThe Recitation,\u201D \u201CThe Reading.\u201D Right, right. And that is not so far away from the idea of \u201CThe Recital,\u201D \u201CThe Musical Recital,\u201D \u201CThe Poetic Recitation.\u201D What\u2019s extraordinary about poetic recitation, whether it\u2019s happening in a very public setting like a poetry reading or a very private setting like your living room, is that when you sit down and you recite poetry, time stops. Something very special is understood to be happening. And people accept that, and they listen. And if you go on the streets of Damascus or Cairo or Beirut, or at least when I was there, people would read poetry in the cafes at night, recite poetry. Right, right. Not even read it but recite it from \u2014 as that beautiful expression has it \u2014 by heart, from memory. And other people responding to the poetry would weep. They would cry. They would lose it. Nowadays, about an hour outside of Karachi in Pakistan, the fakirs still come, and they sing old Sindhi legends, old Sufi legends. People come and they take it in. And you see people in the audience absolutely losing it and opening up the emotional pores, becoming more vulnerable. And I think there is a mysticism. And there is a great part of Islamic culture that is maybe not perceived. But you know, Krista, peace never makes headlines. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the composer Mohammed Fairouz. His new album, Follow, Poet, includes a song cycle, \u201CAudenesque\u201D, setting verse by W.H. Auden and Seamus Heaney; and a five-part ballet called \u201CSadat\u201D, instrumentally telling the life story of the late Egyptian President. This is the first movement from \u201CSadat.\u201D I\u2019d like to talk about your album Follow, Poet. I think in Follow, Poet, this latest album, you\u2019ve brought into relief \u2014 you\u2019ve really worked with and played with, really, this passion that you have for the interplay \u2014 and I\u2019m not even sure this is going to be precise, as I say it \u2014 but between text and music. And it\u2019s so striking. You start \u2014 the CD actually starts with a speech of John F. Kennedy, a speech that \u2014 I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s \u2014 how famous it is. He was receiving an honorary degree at Amherst College in 1963 \u2014 October 26, 1963, which would have been shortly before his death. Yes, yes. And you wrote of this speech, \u201CThe speech is a kind of music by itself.\u201D You\u2019ve said that you\u2019ve been challenged for people asking you, \u201CWhy can\u2019t you just write music for the sake of writing music?\u201D And I want to just draw you out on and how you respond to that and how you think about what you do that\u2019s different, that is resisting that, right, just for the sake of music alone. Well, I mean, Follow, Poet as an album is something I\u2019m very, very proud of. And it\u2019s the accomplishment of many, many people who put their blood and sweat and tears and intellectual energy and acuity into creating something that I think is meaningful. When we talk about the interplay of text and music, we often talk about poetry and music \u2014 what comes first? The music or the text? This is an old question that is asked in sort of the forums of academic minutia. But, actually, text is so much bigger than that. Right. We\u2019re also often talking about lyrics, right? And that\u2019s quite different from what you\u2019re talking about. Well, absolutely. I mean, historically, if you look at the sort of 19th century art songs, what we call lieder \u2014 lieder can be understood as sort of 19th century versions of Beatles songs, right? Right. They\u2019re \u2014 all the little lyrics of these lieder, hundreds and hundreds and thousands of lieders, are all just sort of poems. So these, I mean, I\u2019m sure that when we talk about the classics now or in fifty years from now, whatever, we\u2019re going to see the lyrics as poetry. I mean, the Beatles lyrics are poetry. Right, right, right. Freddie Mercury\u2019s lyrics are poetry, absolutely. And actually, if you write them down, you recite them, you study them, I mean, they become \u2014 and some poems become indelibly linked forever and married to the music that they\u2019re created with. And then they become lyrics. But in any case, I think that we expanded the idea of text. I mean, the idea of text in music often is lyrics, poetry. You\u2019re absolutely right. But text can be a speech given by a political leader. A text can be a road sign, for goodness sakes. It can be anything. I mean, text can be anything, and it can acquire tremendous meaning. And goodness knows, I mean, if you\u2019re traveling in the Middle East, there are road signs that are poetic in their weight and their heaviness, their meaning to people. What do you mean? They\u2019re emotional. What would an example be? Well, I think that a road sign leading to the Old City of Jerusalem has a lot of semblance, a lot of meaning \u2014 a sign outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. I mean, Mahmoud Darwish and Yehuda Amichai wrote two poems that are separate from one another, developed separately. And they are Palestinian and Israeli. Palestinian and Israeli poems writing simultaneously about the same place and using the phrase, \u201CEvery rock is sacred, every stone is sacred.\u201D And of course, that brings up semblance of the Psalms and that every one of your stones is sacred. So actually, a stone can contain within it, a rock can contain within it poetry. And so we started to sort of go back and forth about the idea of how to interweave text and music. And I think that starting with John F. Kennedy\u2019s address at Amherst College, which is absolutely musical, in it he says \u2014 he talks about the role of the artist. He says, \u201CWhere power corrupts, poetry cleanses\u201D \u2014 the idea of poetry as a cleanser. Yeah. He actually concludes in the end that he sees a little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than the full recognition of the role of the artist. I think it\u2019s absolutely not coincidental as an aside that this is the same president who said let\u2019s put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. And we decided to do that and then go from there to the music and come back to his voice and have only \u2014 also a musical evocation of another political speech half a world away by Anwar Sadat. And that\u2019s the great speech that he delivered when he made, in the Arabic tradition, in Arabic history, we know it as the longest journey that Anwar Sadat ever took in his life. The well-traveled diplomat and politician, one of the most seasoned statesmen in the world, who traveled all over the world thousands of miles \u2014 we think that the longest journey he ever took was that 28-minute journey from Cairo to Jerusalem\u2026 Right. \u2026to deliver that speech to the Israeli Knesset. So, Anwar Sadat, president of Egypt \u2014 he was assassinated in 1981, before you were born. Yes. I think what\u2019s interesting about Sadat, who many people of your generation won\u2019t remember and might not even know about \u2014 and perhaps in the immediate history following his death, appeared a tragic figure \u2014 it\u2019s very intriguing to me that, for you, he\u2019s kind of a guiding light. And I see Sadat\u2019s legacy having this living resonance in your work. I mean, here\u2019s some language from that speech to the Israeli Knesset, which I had never heard before: \u201CFill the earth and space with recitals of peace. Turn the song into reality that blossoms and lives.\u201D And what a reflection that is of, again, this approach you\u2019ve taken to the interplay between text and music. There\u2019s music in his words somehow. Absolutely right. These figures, who appear to the people of their generation as tragic figures, become guiding lights to the people of the next generations and the generations to come. And you know, Krista, it absolutely proves the violence that some people espouse, the violence that some people believe is the solution doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s absolute proof of the fact that this violence simply does not work. John F. Kennedy\u2019s words that open Follow, Poet \u2014 his voice is one of the most recognizable voices in the history of the 20th century. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s really interesting to note that the people who attempted to silence him, the minority of people \u2014 I mean, he had a nation behind him. He had the support of much of the world. And yet, there were a few people who decided that violence was the way to silence him, I mean, that he must be assassinated. And those people who attempted to make that point are forgotten. I don\u2019t \u2014 I would not recognize their voice if I heard it on an album. And yet, John F. Kennedy\u2019s voice still resonates. And then of course it drives the point home that this is a minority of people. I mean, Sadat \u2014 it took, what, five, six people who eventually end up to be associated with al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood who wanted to silence him by assassinating him at the military parade. And yet, his voice becomes the guiding light, as you say, for a new generation of people who believe in peace. You know, you often reflect on yourself as a member of your generation. Somewhere I saw you\u2019re referred to as a post-millennial Schubert. I didn\u2019t realize \u2014 but I was more \u2014 the Schubert part I get. I didn\u2019t realize that we\u2019d moved to post-millennial. Me neither. I\u2019m not sure what all these labels mean. But there is something about a turn of century generation of which you are part. And what you\u2019re describing now about this suspicion of the rush to results, a new kind of openness to language that makes something new possible which \u2014 a language that reorients. I feel like that\u2019s what you\u2019re describing. Do you feel like that\u2019s a gener \u2014 sorry. What were you going to say? I\u2019m going to say something that you may think me crazy to say. But I believe that the future is extremely bright. I believe that the future is hopeful. And I think that this generation is absolutely committed to making the world a better place. And I think they have the means to do it. And I think that if the world does not become a better place by the time that I\u2019m 50 or 60, we have no one to blame but ourselves. We have the will. We have the drive. Yeah. We have the knowledge of the world at our fingertips. I think the resources available to us are unparalleled. And light the way to, I think, a great future. I have to say that I share your confidence and hope in this generation. But I think something that\u2019s also characteristic of what is most hopeful now is also reflected in you. I mean, yes, you have this 21st century world of perspective and tools. But you\u2019re also very attentive to, as you say, guiding lights. Right? You know, looking back for wisdom as well, looking for prophetic, poetic voices, taking elders seriously. I really see this in the way you lift up John F. Kennedy or Anwar Sadat or Seamus Heaney, Yeats. That I feel is part of the power that your generation is claiming as well. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? I do think I know what you\u2019re talking about. I think that \u2014 I think we have a long way to go with that. And I think that lifting the elders is an important element of any successful tribal society. And all human society is tribal. We are all tribal creatures by nature. And I hope that we get there. I think we have a ways to go. You can listen again and share this conversation with Mohammed Fairouz through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the composer Mohammed Fairouz, who\u2019s been celebrated as a Schubert for the post-millennial generation. This is \u201CPiano Miniature III\u201D from his 2011 album, Critical Models. In his life and his music, and especially in his new album, Follow, Poet, Mohammed Fairouz makes unexpected connections between music and speech, between art and statecraft. He opens the notions of illustrious language and classical music for a transforming world. Here\u2019s something really beautiful that you wrote: \u201CMusic has accompanied humanity from the very start of our journey, and it has been intertwined with human society ever since. The idea of separating music from the aspirations of society is artificial to me. Beyond the basic utilitarian uses for music in our cultures, to march off to war, sing when the crops are brought in, serenade one\u2019s loved ones, rock a child to sleep with a lullaby. There is an inherent storytelling aspect to music that is linked to the past and the future of every society.\u201D Absolutely. I think that the concept of music for the sake of music or art for the sake of art is not only a new concept, I think it\u2019s also a pretentious concept. I mean, when people ask me, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you just write music for the sake of music?\u201D My response is not only that it\u2019s uninteresting to me but my response is also that music has accompanied human civilization. It\u2019s been an essential storytelling element that keeps, again, the tribe alive, keeps the identity of the tribe alive. Music and poetry are inextricably linked to our humanity. And so I\u2019m not interested in separating music from that just to aggrandize my own cleverness or whatever as a composer. I think I need to be communicating with people. I need to be talking to people. I need to be moving people. The days of classical music are over. The days of elitism in art are over. The days where artists speak over people\u2019s heads and then claim that they\u2019re more clever and more special than the people who don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re saying are over. You have to speak to your audience. Isn\u2019t it interesting \u2014 and I\u2019m going to say this as an \u201Cand\u201D rather than a \u201Cbut\u201D \u2014 Follow, Poet is \u2014 with this album, you\u2019ve become the youngest composer to record a full album for Deutsche Grammophon, which is this iconic 115-year-old classical label. I mean, I think that speaks to evolution. Well, I think that \u2014 I think it speaks to a faith in the young. Yeah. I think it speaks to, hopefully, what\u2019s being said in the music. And I think, as I said, I mean, this album is the result of the work of many, many people, who all sort of unified their vision and believe in something, I mean, believe in something that\u2019s bigger than themselves. We believe in something that\u2019s bigger than ourself. It\u2019s believing \u2014 we all believe that someone who listens to this may be moved. It may affect them. It may move them to do something good in their day or in their hour or in their life. I mean, maybe that\u2019s too much to hope for, but if it\u2019s a very small percentage of people, it\u2019s still better than sitting around and doing nothing. You\u2019ve spoken of the artist as an agent of hope, which I hear in what you just described. Again, to that question, to that eternal, that cynical question that always arises, to what effect? What difference does it make? Does it change the world? Well, I think that\u2019s a very interesting question, actually. And I think that it is a question that\u2019s viable. What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the use of poetry? What\u2019s the use of art? And Auden actually asks that question. I mean in the elegy for Yeats, which is set to music in my song cycle, \u201CAudenesque,\u201D on this album, Follow, Poet. Yeah. Do you have those lines \u2014 do you have that in front of you? That \u201CFollow, Poet, follow right to the bottom of the night\u2026\u201D You know, absolutely not. I don\u2019t have the lines in front of me, but I carry the lines everywhere I go. I think that \u2014 I carry them in my head. Yeah. I have to say, I think memorizing poetry is absolutely vital. It\u2019s absolutely important. It gives the poetic tools that one needs to get through life. Can you just say some of that? Well, I think that what\u2019s extraordinary about the elegy for Yeats is that it begins in a very cynical and dark place. \u201CHe disappeared in the dead of winter: The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted.\u201D It gets darker and darker and darker. You have this image that could be contemporary Wall Street. \u201CBut in the importance and noise of to-morrow, When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Bourse, And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed.\u201D I mean, all of this stuff. And then he uses this line: \u201CAnd each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom.\u201D \u201CCell of himself,\u201D \u201Csequestered\u201D \u2014 you know, being sequestered in the cell of yourself. And it gets more and more dark. In fact, then he asks the question, and says, \u201CFor poetry makes nothing happen.\u201D He says this. Right. He says this in this poem. \u201CFor poetry makes nothing happen: it exists in the valley of its making where executives would never want to tamper.\u201D And then it goes back to meter. It goes back to the poetry of the elders. \u201CEarth, receive an honoured guest: William Yeats is laid to rest. Let the Irish vessel lie, Emptied of its poetry.\u201D These are extraordinary lines that speak of the absolute darkness of Europe on the of going over the edge, the world on the brink of war. He says, \u201CIn the nightmare of the dark, All the dogs of Europe bark, And the living nations wait, Each sequestered in its hate.\u201D Again, sequestration. Sequestered, each sequestered, each in his cell. But then at the very bottom of the night, Auden turns all of this around and says, \u201CFollow, Poet, follow right, To the bottom of the night, With your unconstraining voice, Still persuade us to rejoice; With the farming of a verse, Make a vineyard of the curse, Sing of human unsuccess, In a rapture of distress.\u201D And he goes on and on and on. It\u2019s the most extraordinary thing, really. And I thought to myself, well, it\u2019s a once in a lifetime poetic miracle. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with composer Mohammed Fairouz. I would also like to talk about your Poems and Prayers album, your third symphony. And I always ask this question when I start, and I didn\u2019t do it for some reason. Was there a religious or spiritual background to your childhood? You know, other than understanding Islam and having understood and in a way appreciating, now, my parents\u2019 liberal view of Islam that so many people share, that the vast majority of Muslims share. It wasn\u2019t anything that was absolutely central. But it was a part of my childhood for sure. So when you wrote this symphony, this \u201CPoems and Prayers,\u201D you actually steeped in the poetry and statecraft of Israel as well as Palestine, I\u2019d say, ancient and modern as you wrote this music. And I just \u2014 I\u2019d be curious about what you\u2019ve learned in that, how that may have changed you, imprinted the person and the composer you were after that. \u201CPoems and Prayers\u201D engages in the mess \u2014 it\u2019s my third symphony \u2014 engages in the mess of the Middle East. And by mess, I mean it\u2019s really about the fact that the Middle East, the Arab world, the history of the Middle East, the Assyrians, the Jews, the Phoenicians, the Israelites, the Philistines, the Egyptians, and so on and so forth is not a prix fixe meal. They all intermixed and intermingled. And in fact, it\u2019s interesting when you look at this barbaric group ISIS. I like to call them Daesh because they don\u2019t like that name, and that\u2019s the Arabic acronym for\u2026 And that\u2019s what people call them, yes. And they actually went in and started an assault on the common heritage of all humanity, but especially of the Arab world, in destroying the Assyrian and Babylonian sites. But one of the things I was reminded of, when I was watching this terrible destruction take place was The epic of Gilgamesh. And reading in Gilgamesh, this idea the story of the man who created a great ark and who set sail as the world flooded under apocalyptic rising waters and saved the species, the varied species of the earth. And I was not reading the story of Noah; I was reading Gilgamesh. And this happened a thousand years \u2014 it was written a thousand years between \u2014 before the Old Testament story of Noah. So it\u2019s interesting how all of the cultures in that part of the world intermingle and interweave. \u201CPoems and Prayers\u201D intermingles them in an interesting way. It starts with the Aramaic \u201CKaddish\u201D \u2014 \u201CYit\u2019gadal v\u2019yit\u2019kadash sh\u2019mei raba\u201D \u2014 which has acquired connotations of being the Jewish prayer for the dead. But it also sets the poetry of Fadwa Tuqan. She was considered the poetess of Palestine, one of the greatest poets in Arabic literature. And in fact, Arab schoolboys and schoolgirls throughout the latter part of the 20th century were required to memorize her poetry. And so\u2026 Was this something that you knew before, or is it something you learned as you created this work? No, it was something I knew before. OK. And also, the poetry of the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish. And then the great Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai. Right. And interestingly enough, all of the linguistic similarities come about as well, Fadwa Tuqan saying, \u201CIn this day,\u201D \u201Cfi hatha al-yom\u201D (\u0641\u064A \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u064A\u0648\u0645), \u201Cyom\u201D being an Arabic word for \u201Cday,\u201D and Yehuda Amichai beginning \u201CMemorial Day for the War Dead,\u201D \u201Cy\u00F3m zikar\u00F3n lem\u00E9t\u00E9 hamilkhama\u201D in Hebrew. The linguistic similarities, the similarities of theme, the similarities of culture, and then you go, of course, to that part of the world \u2014 the similarities of food, the similarities of expression, the similarities of \u2014 and you realize of course \u2014 I\u2019ve said this before \u2014 that this is a family fight. Right. And family fights, unfortunately \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 people say, \u201CWell, why would you whitewash it by saying or undermine it by saying it\u2019s a family fight?\u201D Family fights are the most aggressive of all fights. Are the hardest, yes. The most brutal, yes. We\u2019ve all been through that. I mean, family fights are \u2014 we\u2026 Yeah. I guess I also just want to point at what you\u2019re describing which is immersing in \u2014 you use this language of statecraft which is kind of \u2014 which I like that. It\u2019s kind of an old-fashioned term. It\u2019s kind of a formal term. Oh is it? But you are you are coming at all the things we talk about when we talk around statecraft by way of music and poetry and then making new \u2014 making fresh observations. Well, I mean \u2014 I think that statecraft is actually \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to hear that it\u2019s an old fashioned word. It is a formal word, I guess I mean. I think it\u2019s a wonderful word. Yeah. And I think that great statesmen use language in order to bring people together. I\u2019m filled with a sort of poetic admiration, of course. And I think that it\u2019s very, very interesting, actually, that the line between the arts and statecraft is not so as far away as you might think. The line between fiction and realism isn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s not a very expansive border. I mean, I\u2019m now working on two operas with two different writers. And I was sort of meditating on this, and I found it extraordinary that both of them have a background in journalism. And both of them turned to fiction, turned to writing novels, because they found that they could tell the truth in fiction\u2026 Right, right. \u2026more than they could in journalism. So it\u2019s not a wide gap. It really is not a wide gap. I mean, sometimes truth is just truth. You have drawn an interesting analogy between, let\u2019s say, this frontier we\u2019re on of living in a globalizing world and yet identity being as vital and essential a thing as ever before. In some ways, coming into relief. You wrote this: \u201COne of my great mentors, Edward Said, borrowed the term \u2018counterpoint\u2019 from music and applied it to critical thought in politics and in society as a way for cultures to exist in a tapestry of counterpoint without any culture giving up its individual sense of beauty but contributing to the greater whole.\u201D I mean, you often, in your music, use contrapuntal forms to multiple melodic lines that have their independence but make up one piece of music. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m saying that very eloquently. But it does seem to me a very useful analogy for where we are as societies as well. Well, absolutely. I mean, the world has to exist in counterpoint. I mean, in order to understand this, it\u2019s very important to understand the musical concept of counterpoint. And the musical concept of counterpoint is very simple, actually. You have a melody or a tune. And it\u2019s beautiful. And then you have another melody or a tune, and another one. And you put them all together and play them simultaneously, like singing \u201CRow, Row, Row Your Boat\u201D in canon. And instead of each individual melody losing anything by being combined as a whole, it becomes like a wonderful tapestry, a tapestry where each of these individual threads doesn\u2019t lose its meaning, doesn\u2019t lose its identity, doesn\u2019t lose its own raison d\u2019etre, its own reason for being, but contributes to the whole tapestry of counterpoint. So if we see the world as a tapestry of counterpoint, not hegemony of one line or one culture over another or domination or anything like that. And also not necessarily harmonic or not always \u2014 right? Perhaps again and again harmonic but not continuously. No, because, I mean, imagine a piece of music of endless harmony. What could be more boring? I often will think at the end of a conversation like this about asking, through the life you\u2019ve lived, through the work you\u2019ve done, how has your sense evolved, how would you speak now about what it means to be human? You\u2019re very \u2014 you have this keen awareness of the fact that we live in a post-9/11, post-Tahrir Square, globalized, technologized, 21st century world. What, for you, at this point in your life, would you say \u2014 what does it mean to be human and a musician at this moment in time? Well, I think that music and poetry, the arts, do something that is very, very special in that they allow us access to a rarefied space, a sacred space almost. They take us beyond the 9/11s, beyond the Tahrir Squares, beyond Facebook and Twitter and all of this stuff. They allow us to reach beyond the day to day. They allow us to reach beyond the muddled present and in a way to touch something that is timeless and eternal. And I think that is the essence of what we do, what we\u2019re privileged to do as artists. Mohammed Fairouz has recorded 11 albums including Native Informant, In The Shadow of No Towers, and Poems and Prayers. Follow, Poet is his latest work, and it\u2019s the inaugural release in a new series called Return to Language by Universal Music Classics. And here\u2019s how Follow, Poet ends, with the Irish poet Paul Muldoon reading the final lines of W.H. Auden\u2019s poem \u201CIn Memory of W.B. Yeats.\u201D \u201CFollow, Poet, follow right To the bottom of the night, With your unconstraining voice Still persuade us to rejoice; With the farming of a verse Make a vineyard of the curse, Sing of human unsuccess In a rapture of distress; In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start, In the prison of his days Teach the free man how to praise.\u201D"
