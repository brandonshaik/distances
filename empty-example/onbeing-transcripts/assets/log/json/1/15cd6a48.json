  "fullText": "I tell people that I could have the most profound equanimity and I am two words away from losing it completely. And then they say, \u201CWhat are those two words?\u201D I say, \u201CWell, you have to understand that first the phone has to ring.\u201D Ring, ring, and you pick up the phone and a voice says, \u201CHello, Ma?\u201D And it doesn\u2019t sound right \u2014 the complete \u2014 you get that. Yeah, to the point of our evening. That\u2019s Sylvia Boorstein \u2014 a celebrated Jewish-Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist. I interviewed her in 2011 at a live event co-sponsored by WDET Detroit Public Radio and Metro Parent magazine. From APM, American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Sylvia Boorstein flew in from Northern California, where she lives, teaches, and writes. You know, when Mikel and I first started talking about this and we knew that Detroit Metro Parent was involved, we were interested in this theme of raising children, which, of course, just means raising human beings. In a world that, I think, feels \u2014 I suppose the world always feels complicated in any age, but I think there\u2019s a pace of change and uncertainty right now. It is unsettling and it\u2019s unsettling to be a parent or a grandparent at the best of times. So we started thinking about who I might want to have with me, who I might want to speak with. And, you know, in the beginning we were thinking about experts on parenting or grandparenting, and then what I realized is I really just wanted somebody who was wise and who also had lived this experience of raising children. And my mind eventually came back around to Sylvia Boorstein, who I\u2019d read years ago. I didn\u2019t tell you this. I stumbled across your book about 10 years ago, I think, when I was first having the idea for this show \u2014 her book That\u2019s Funny, You Don\u2019t Look Buddhist. Sylvia is one of the people who literally brought Buddhism to the West, to the United States, in the 1970s \u2014 and was Jewish, like a lot of the people who brought Buddhism to the West in the 1970s, a lot of people who still are sort of household names with Buddhism in the United States. But she\u2019s also written over the years about how she has come back to really richly integrate that with her Jewish identity, finding again in Judaism the imagery and poetry and ancestry and continuity that nourish her, and that she\u2019s also passed on to her children. So when I thought of Sylvia as this wise person, I started Googling to see if you ever wrote about children and parenting and grandparenting. What I found is that, in her bio description, everywhere I could find it, she lists herself this way. She has lots of credentials, but it started out, \u201CSylvia Boorstein is a wife, mother, grandmother, author, teacher, psychotherapist.\u201D And I thought, \u201CThat\u2019s it. This is our person.\u201D Actually, I\u2019m happy that you discovered that. I think it\u2019s true. I normally describe myself that way. And I find that when people say, \u201CWhat are you proudest of in your whole life?\u201D it\u2019s clear to me that I am most proud of the fact that my children now, really adults, all of them now, three of the four of them are in their 50s, so that\u2019s really a substantial credential. And they\u2019re all very, very nice people. And that is my best. That\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of. And my grandchildren are coming along, and they are very good people. I\u2019m so proud of that. That\u2019s the best thing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done it \u2014 I certainly haven\u2019t done it alone. I\u2019ve done it with their father and I\u2019ve done it with their teachers and with our community, but they are, I think, my most important work in my life. How many grandchildren do you have? I have seven. Mm-hmm. So, you know, one thing that I enjoyed reading in \u2014 I think it was in your book That\u2019s Funny, You Don\u2019t Look Buddhist, you wrote that your father\u2019s mother \u2014 that would have been your Jewish grandmother \u2014 was your first Buddhist teacher, that she used to tell you, \u201CWhere is it written that you\u2019re supposed to be happy all the time?\u201D You have to know that I grew up in a post-Depression household. Both my parents had jobs and I\u2019m an only child. I lived with my two parents and my grandmother, who was widowed, my father\u2019s mother. And my parents went off to work, so my grandmother did a great deal of the mothering, and she was very, very solicitous, so that I remember her as bathing and washing and dressing me and making braids and preparing the kinds of foods that I liked. The only thing that she was pretty not moved to respond to was the coming and going of childhood bouts of \u201CI\u2019m not happy.\u201D I\u2019d say, \u201CBut I\u2019m not happy.\u201D And she\u2019d say \u2014 my grandmother was not a learned woman in that sense, but it\u2019s an ethnic thing to use that Talmudic turn of phrase \u2014 and she\u2019d say, \u201CWhere is it written that you\u2019re supposed to be happy all the time?\u201D And I actually think it was the beginning of my spiritual practice that life is difficult. Then 40 years later, I learned that the Buddhists said the same thing, that life is inevitably challenging and how are we going to do it in a way that\u2019s wise and doesn\u2019t complicate it more than it is just by itself? So I want to talk tonight about \u2014 about that wisdom that you\u2019ve learned and how it might apply to our lives as parents. Not just the spiritual lives of our children, but how we nourish ourselves, right, as we are present to them and as we impart what we want to impart to them. I have to say, Sylvia, that, you know, you\u2019re sitting here and you are so \u2014 so calm and you radiate wisdom and your books radiate wisdom. So it\u2019s somewhat comforting for me for you to also describe yourself as a lifelong worrier and just talk about how being fretful comes naturally, because you talked about that from your own childhood that your mother was ill. Mm-hmm. I had reasons to be anxious as a child. My mother did have what they called in those days a weak heart. She\u2019d had rheumatic fever as a child and she had, as a consequence, she lived with a chronic coronary insufficiency, and I worried about that. She actually died when I was in my very early 20s. So I\u2019ve passed more than 50 years now without a mother. I wish I\u2019d had one longer, but when I was a child, I worried about it a lot. But you know what I\u2019ve found, Krista? There are people who are given to fretting without a fretful environment. I think it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s a genetic glitch of neurology and that it happens to some people and not for other people. Actually, the Buddha said we have one of five genetic fallback glitches when we\u2019re challenged. He said some people fret, some people get angry, some people lose heart and all their energy goes and they don\u2019t know what to do with themselves, some people think, \u201CUh-oh, it\u2019s me. I didn\u2019t do things right. It\u2019s always my fault. I messed things up.\u201D And some people need to be sensually soothed. They think, \u201CWhere\u2019s a donut shop? Where\u2019s a pizza?\u201D People have different tendencies. It was very, very helpful for me as an adult to learn that because it\u2019s completely comes without a judgment. I don\u2019t have to say I am a chronic fretter. I could say, you know, when I\u2019m challenged, fretting arises in my mind and it\u2019s not a moral flaw. And it\u2019s very good for people who have a short fuse to be able to think, \u201CYou know, I have this unusual neurological glitch.\u201D That naturally arises in me to know that. This is what happens when I\u2019m challenged. But to take it as \u2014 I tell it to people that my glitch is that \u201Cwhen in doubt, worry.\u201D It came with the equipment. I\u2019m also short and I have brown eyes. If I could see that in the same neutral, it just came with the equipment, then I don\u2019t have to feel bad about it, but I can work with it wisely. That\u2019s really the important part, when we see as adults what it is that our fallback glitch is. You can say, \u201CUh-oh.\u201D And I think, in a certain way, that\u2019s a sign of wisdom when a person begins to be able to delineate this is what happens to me under tension. Is that piece of self-knowledge. As a piece of self-knowledge that \u2014 that makes a break in between a certain next step and that next step and say, \u201COh.\u201D So that when I\u2019m at an airport, for instance, and they say, \u201CAttention, ladies and gentlemen,\u201D in the next half a second my mind will always think somebody crashed. That is it. Not everyone thinks that, you know, but many people do. Right, right. I tested it out; I asked people. But it in that in that mini \u2014 \u201CAttention, ladies and gentlemen,\u201D and then I think, Oh-oh. And then they say, \u201CPlease stay close to you luggage \u2026\u201D And they always say the same thing, too, so it\u2019s not like I \u2014 I \u2014 but \u2014 so, I actually I don\u2019t get to startled when I have that thought. It\u2019s just the thought. Or if I come to a place where I\u2019ve agreed to meet my husband on a corner of a certain street at 5:00 and I come there at 5:00 and he\u2019s not there and it\u2019s five past five and he\u2019s not there, I could start to think maybe this, maybe that, maybe this, maybe that. Right, right. But I think to myself, wait a minute. That is just my peculiar neurological glitch kicking in. Probably not, you know, I could just wait here quietly. I could look in the windows. I could look at the people. I could say relaxing phrases to my own mind. I could wish well to the passersby. There are just lots of other things I can do. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this On Being, conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CWhat We Nurture,\u201D a public conversation with Jewish-Buddhist mother, grandmother, teacher, and psychotherapist Sylvia Boorstein. I happened to have the experience of having my first child, my daughter, while I was at seminary, while I was studying theology, which was a really interesting thing to do, to be reflecting theologically and then going through this experience of bringing life into the world. One of \u2014 one of the really strong reactions I had after she was born was realizing that I\u2019d grown up using this language of God as Father and that it\u2019s not very \u2014 we don\u2019t reflect on what we mean because this Father God who I always thought of was so sovereign, so powerful, right? And the experience of becoming a parent is \u2014 is one of excruciating vulnerability and loss of control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And to be able to know that. And this whole thing of worrying and catastrophizing and being fearful gives you all kinds of rich new reasons to do all of those things. Actually, no, no. It\u2019s really a fact one of the people, who \u2014 a woman, who came regularly \u2014 I teach at Spirit Rock Meditation Center out in California, and the class is kind of a regular group of people that comes every Wednesday. And a woman came who was pregnant with her first child, and the whole group was looking forward to her having her baby. She took some time off after the baby was born and then she came back, brought the baby with her, and she talked about \u2014 she said, \u201CYou know, when I became pregnant, everybody said congratulations, great, great, great, great, great. When I had the baby, everybody said congratulations, great, great, great, great, great. Nobody tells me that I had, at that point, mortgaged my heart for the entire rest of my life, because my happiness now depends on this baby being well and healthy and nothing bad happening to it. Nobody tells you that. They don\u2019t say when they hear \u2014 they don\u2019t say, \u2018Uh-oh, you know, brace yourself.\u2019 They say \u2014 they say, \u2018Congratulations.'\u201D Right. Because you know, Krista, it\u2019s both. It is congratulations. It\u2019s the most amazing thing we can do, as you said, you know, theologically speaking, to create a new life that comes out with fingernails and eyelashes and all of its fingers and toes. It\u2019s an amazing thing. And it\u2019s extremely awakening in the sense of knowing how vulnerable we are. You know, sometimes when you say goodbye to somebody, you say, \u201CI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201D And you really actually never know, and it would be grim to think about that all the time. But if I think about that enough of the time, I think the result of my thinking about that a lot is that I try very hard not to harbor any grudges and not to leave anybody in a not good way and to say I love you as much as I can when I leave people and when I talk to my children or my grandchildren. I think that\u2019s actually this equality you think about \u2026 You mean the effect of being aware of how fragile \u2014 how fragile and strange and unpredictable life is. In fact, in fact. The \u2014 the crux of what the Buddha taught is really \u2014 is realizing that everything passes, including these lives, and it\u2019s not a gloomy or macabre kind of philosophy. It\u2019s really an understanding, but that\u2019s what\u2019s true. And knowing that\u2019s what\u2019s true, I think, we are mandated not to waste any time with enmity or negativity or grudges. It\u2019s so easy to make a grudge list and then nurture it. Um, you know, the world has changed pretty rapidly in this sense as well. People tend to \u2014 you\u2019ll often have mixed families of one parent is religious, the other is not, or they come from different traditions and their extended families may have 10 different traditions. But then when people become parents, they often still start asking this question: Do I want to pass something on or what do I want to pass on? A rabbi, Sandy Sasso, said to me once that many of us, not all of us, have a mother tongue, a tradition we grew up in, and we may have rejected that. But she said, \u201CDon\u2019t let your tradition be defined by people who may have ruined it for you.\u201D That probably is a first place to look. Actually, the truth about me is I didn\u2019t come back to Judaism. I\u2019ve never left. Many people come back, that\u2019s true. I actually never left. I had always a very cordial and warm relationship to Judaism. My family was comfortably a fairly traditional Jewish family as I grew up. I never questioned that I was fundamentally a Jew in the sense of my native language, as Sandy Sasso would say. I actually was introduced to a couple of meditative paths that didn\u2019t particularly speak to me. And then I met my teachers and I went on retreat and I was very touched by what they said and particularly the understanding about the difference between a life inevitably challenged by pain and complications, but free of suffering. That there would be a way to train the mind to not make more suffering out of the inevitable challenges of life. And it just sounded exactly true to me. It made tremendous sense. It was like, phew, someone understands that there\u2019s something anxiety-provoking about life. And I thought that my private anxiety was mine. Nobody else had it. And I thought about becoming enlightened and that, if I practice meditation enough, that the challenges of life and the pain and the disappointments of it would just \u2014 I would sail over them with great equanimity. That didn\u2019t happen? That didn\u2019t happen, that didn\u2019t happen. I tell people \u2014 I tell people that I could have the most profound equanimity and I am two words away from losing it completely. Then they say, \u201CWhat are those two words?\u201D I\u2019d say, \u201CWell, you have to understand that first the phone has to ring. Ring, ring and you pick up the phone and a voice says, \u201CHello, Ma?\u201D And it doesn\u2019t sound right \u2014 the complete \u2014 you get that. Yeah, to the point of our evening. Because that\u2019s a whole different story. But the truth is that we are connected with empathic bonds of tremendous energy. I wouldn\u2019t want it otherwise. I don\u2019t want to sail above my emotional life. I don\u2019t want to complicate my emotions with worse complications by struggling with what I can\u2019t change or by reacting without thinking things through. In the beginning, I think I had a more lofty idea of what would happen if I practiced a lot, become a lot more pedestrian. I\u2019d like to live kindly with a good heart because I\u2019ll be the happiest that way. Let\u2019s talk about this core insight that suffering \u2014 and, again, we\u2019re acknowledging that parenting is the greatest loss of control we ever suffer \u2014 that suffering results from struggling with what is beyond my control, that idea that our minds get in conflict with our experience and that\u2019s where suffering comes from, not so much from the realities themselves, but how we struggle with them. How do you think that applies to this? Well, I just remembered actually just before we came out here this evening. I was sitting backstage and I remembered I was on a flight last Friday, and there was a family of five traveling with me. And everything is progressing well; it wasn\u2019t a terribly long flight. Near the end of the flight, the two- or three-year-old, she just fell asleep and now she\u2019s awakened and it\u2019s late in the afternoon. Probably her naptime is way off. She not only woke up, but she woke up and she\u2019s beside herself and crying and flailing in the way of three-year-olds. I watched these two parents and they were fabulous. Her mother was completely just consoling, quietly talking to her, not losing her equanimity at all. I was marveling at it. I thought it was wonderful. You know, sometimes you see much more upset parents. This parent was not upset. Then by and by after a little while, the dad over here said, \u201CPass her to me.\u201D So they changed children. She passed this one back to him. And then he \u2014 behind me \u2014 spoke to her in such a kindly way, and slowly, slowly she pulled herself together. I just so admired their parenting skills. I admired it because, first of all, the child calmed herself down. They didn\u2019t whiz themselves up and create more suffering for themselves. They also didn\u2019t create more suffering for the whole plane because, you know, sometimes when a child is getting upset and the parent becomes all upset, then you feel pulled into it. Right. But somehow these parents\u2019 equanimity was like a calming effect around the whole plane. And I thought well they were really \u2014 at the time, I thought they were really good parents. But I thought the element of their goodness was that they\u2019re acting very wise, and that the wisdom involved is this child is two and a half and that\u2019s what two-and-a-half-year-olds do when they\u2019re awakened from a nap in the middle of a loud and rumbling landing. You know, that\u2019s also an illustration of a distinction you made when you talk about wise effort. I found this really helpful. I feel like that\u2019s a story about it. You said in terms of our reactions, that there\u2019s a big difference in any moment between asking, \u201CAm I pleased?\u201D Which of course, on an airplane and you have a screaming child, you\u2019re not pleased. You\u2019re embarrassed. You think you will be less disruptive if you can make them quiet. But the difference between asking, \u201CAm I pleased?\u201D or \u201CIn this moment, am I able to care?\u201D Yeah, for the child and for myself in a kindly way. You know, here\u2019s something else you\u2019ve said that \u2014 that\u2019s provocative and just so true. \u201CIt\u2019s not fair\u201D \u2014 the three words \u201Cit\u2019s not fair\u201D have caused more trouble than any words throughout history. But, you know, what\u2019s interesting about that is it\u2019s not fair is also the beginning of our children\u2019s ethical instinct. In fact. And to varying degrees, we live with that instinct throughout our lives. I think that\u2019s a really important point, Krista. I think probably people will be able to relate to that, you know, when you grow up in a family and, in the normal course of parenting, even before the child ventures out in the world and goes to school, there are incidents where they need to share with someone or whatever it is, they have to wait in line, and we say we do this because it\u2019s fair and we do this because it\u2019s fair. We carry on about it\u2019s fair because it\u2019s fair. Then they go to school and they come home and they say the teacher has favorites. They favor so-and-so and so-and-so over me. You say I\u2019m terribly sorry, I can\u2019t do anything about that, and they say, \u201CBut it\u2019s not fair.\u201D Here you are, the people who have said it\u2019s about fairness. Sometimes you have to say it\u2019s not fair and we can\u2019t do anything about it. But in the larger sense, when we as adults occupy ourselves with what\u2019s not fair in the world and we take our children with us and they hear and see and take part in the expressions of our own generosity, our own kindness, our own social activism, when I think about parenting, I think you said it before about parenting as a spiritual practice. I think as social activism as a spiritual practice. I think of voting as a spiritual practice. So how do we help them walk that line between \u2014 you know, I remember Sister Helen Prejean, who is a great opponent of the death penalty, said. \u201CAnger is a moral response.\u201D But then it\u2019s what you do with that anger? This is what you\u2019re saying also, that it\u2019s not fair is a fundament of morality and of activism. So how do we walk that line between demonstrating that and also helping ourselves and our children live wisely with those feelings and those observations of life\u2019s unfairness? You know, I think a lot about that. I remember my father, who is now long gone, hearing me teach about transforming anger into work in the world, doing something. He\u2019d say, \u201CI need my anger, Sylvia. It motivates me to do all the activism that I do.\u201D I\u2019d say, \u201CWell, you do need it, Dad. You need it just to alert you to what needs attention, but you don\u2019t need to carry it along with you to keep refueling you.\u201D As a matter of fact, if you keep nurturing the flame of anger, it confuses the mind and maybe we don\u2019t respond as wisely as we ought to. But I need the anger as if I had 104 fever; it would be a sign that I need to do something about it. But then you let the anger \u2026 But then you let it \u2014 well, I hope that what I do is I recognize the anger as a response actually. It\u2019s a response, I think, to what I feel underneath it, which is a fear. Things really aren\u2019t fair; this is not right that this and this is happening in the world. And I think it responds to that fear, which is basic. The human response is to lash out at it when something frightens us. You know what\u2019s the easiest example of that? If you come by a door and, as a joke, someone\u2019s hiding behind the door and they leap out and they say, \u201CBoo!\u201D and you get mad at them for doing it. Or you see sometimes \u2014 this is a terrible thing to see. You see sometimes a child rushes out into traffic, and a parent runs out and grabs it and then hits it. But what they\u2019ve done is, they\u2019ve gotten frightened and then they get angry. So I think that the anger is on top of the fear and to be able to say I am frightened, because in the world these unjust things are happening, what can I do and how can I have a mind that\u2019s energized to do something about it, but not reacting in anger, but responding in firm kindness? But things need to be different. Things need to be different. You can watch and experience my entire live, 90-minute conversation with Sylvia Boorstein on our website. About 350 people joined us at the Community House in Birmingham, Michigan, and they posed some of their thoughts and questions to her and to me as a mother as well. And at one point, Sylvia led all of us in an eight-minute guided lovingkindness or \u201Cmetta\u201D meditation. Here\u2019s a flavor of that: So you don\u2019t have to sit in a special way. But if you want to, close your eyes and just take two deep breaths in and out, in and out. Take along breath in and out and in again and out, and feel yourself sitting here, feel yourself sitting here, feel yourself surrounded by all these people. Feel yourself, I hope, happy and content and think in your mind a blessing for yourself. The metta practice, lovingkindness practice, always begins with a blessing for yourself. So think for yourself, \u201CMay I feel safe.\u201D Put those words in your mind. \u201CMay I feel content.\u201D \u201CMay I feel strong.\u201D \u201CMay I live with ease.\u201D Find this entire meditation as it unfolded on our website. Experience it for yourself and share it with others. And, of course, you can watch or listen again to the entire evening. Just go to onbeing.org. We\u2019re also on Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter. Follow our show @beingtweets. I share my thoughts @kristatippett. Coming up, what GPS might teach us about inner equanimity.. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this On Being. Today: \u201CWhat We Nurture\u201D \u2014 my conversation with the warm and wise Jewish-Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist Sylvia Boorstein. I think you\u2019ve said something like that you were a measuring stick for how clearly you\u2019re thinking is how if you\u2019re able to be kind. Oh, I think that, you know, I have been talking a lot about kindness in the last few years. It\u2019s such in a sense a humble word when we think about spiritual practices or if I think about 30 or more years ago when I began to be interested in a meditative path. We talked about things like enlightenment and revelation and kindness is much more humble. But I actually think kindness is what I\u2019d really like to establish in myself. The Dalai Lama, when people ask him what\u2019s your religion, says my religion is kindness. I think that\u2019s a word that subsumes tolerance and forgiveness and graciousness and patience. What I like about kindness is that it\u2019s doable. Unlike those virtues like compassion or even tolerance that you have to cultivate, you can be a lifetime cultivating those things. You can actually be kind to someone even if you don\u2019t feel especially compassionate or it can be an act. It\u2019s an act and I think it\u2019s on the way to actually genuinely being compassionate. The way I keep thinking about it, Krista, is when I\u2019m kind, in any circumstance \u2014 whatever, someone cuts in front of me in line. You go in with a basket in the supermarket and someone zips in right in front of you and you only have two items in your basket anyway, so they could have not, so your mind thinks a thought. But when my mind thinks a thought like that or they shouldn\u2019t have done that, in that moment, I\u2019m complicating my own mind with my own negativity, which I\u2019d rather not do. But if could catch myself do that and instead think to myself, who knows, maybe he\u2019s late for some place, maybe he really needs to be \u2014 maybe this is urgent, may he be well, may he get there in good shape, may he live happily, then I don\u2019t really mess up my own mind and I\u2019m two minutes later in the supermarket checkout. So I\u2019ve done myself a kindness. And the wisdom, I think, that comes from not upsetting the mind is you never know. I really don\u2019t know where that person is going and you never know whether it\u2019s good to go out now or two minutes later. Maybe, you know, who knows what traffic he\u2019ll get into or I. Just to not fight with the moment. There they are. Why complicate it? I think we\u2019re in the habit of doing that a lot. And I suppose we model that for our children then and they become like that too. Do you have thoughts about passing this kind of idea, this kind of teaching, on to children? Even as I say that, I realize that probably the best way is to be like that. I remember my daughter, who\u2019s 17 now, she said to me the other day, \u201CSo is this one of those do what I say, not what I do things?\u201D Right, um, but do you \u2014 do you \u2014 so I assume you model this, but do you talk to your children or your grandchildren about kindness, about this kind of \u2026 I think it probably comes up in the conversation from time to time. I don\u2019t bring it up as, you know, as a sermon, but I think by what we respond to and what we nurture, that\u2019s really what grows in our children. One of my friends has a story that he likes to tell, which I\u2019ve heard now as a Native American story. I\u2019ve heard it as every kind of a story, but as wise grandfather saying to his grandson \u2014 or it could be a wise grandmother saying to her granddaughter \u2014 I have two wolves in my heart: One is loving and one is vicious and they\u2019re at war with each other. The grandchild is saying, which is going to win? And the grandparent saying, the one I feed. I\u2019ve heard that too. I think our children learn to speak in a tone that we speak in or to hold people kindly if we do. I had in my mind I wanted to tell this. I\u2019ve never said it in a public audience, but I just thought about it recently. I decided that \u2014 I\u2019ll find out soon if this is a good analogy \u2014 but I was thinking about the GPS in my car. It never gets annoyed at me. If I make a mistake, it says, \u201CRecalculating.\u201D And then it tells me to make the soonest left turn and go back. I thought to myself, you know, I should write a book and call it \u201CRecalculating\u201D because I think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing all the time. That something happens, it challenges us and the challenge is, OK, so do you want to get mad now? You could get mad, you could go home, you could make some phone calls, you could tell a few people you can\u2019t believe what this person said or that person said. Indignation is tremendously seductive, you know, and to share with other people on the telephone and all that. So to not do it and to say, wait a minute, apropos of what you said before, wise effort to say to yourself, wait a minute, this is not the right road. Literally, this is not the right road. There\u2019s a fork in the road here. I could become indignant, I could flame up this flame of negativity or I could say, \u201CRecalculating.\u201D I\u2019ll just go back here. So this is an example of technology instilling us with spiritual discipline \u2014 we find so much to criticize. And no matter how many times I don\u2019t make that turn, it will continue to say, \u201CRecalculating.\u201D The tone of voice will stay the same. That\u2019s good. I think it\u2019s a good analogy. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today: \u201CWhat We Nurture\u201D \u2014 my conversation with the warm and wise Jewish-Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist Sylvia Boorstein. Sylvia, I want to ask you, to this question of raising children, human beings who are kind, who have a heart for the world, in a world that\u2019s troubled \u2014 when you and I met on a panel in Southern California two years ago, you told a story about leading mindfulness teaching sessions. And you told a story about, I think, it was a man who at the end of it said, \u201CI\u2019m frightened to go back out into the world. I feel so vulnerable and in here I\u2019m safe, but I don\u2019t know how I can be out in the world and be vulnerable.\u201D And that story came back to me as I was thinking about interviewing you on this subject because I think, as a parent, there\u2019s a version of that that goes through my mind. How much do I expose my children to? How do I teach them to be kind and open to the world\u2019s pain and vulnerable? And yet I want them to be safe, and I actually want them to be tough out in that scary world at the same time. Talk to me about that. Well, I remember \u2014 it\u2019s a two-part answer, I remember that, um, I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the exactly that moment, but I\u2019m sure it happened because it comes up often. And people will come and spend a week at a retreat center or a weekend or however many days and then they do say, here everyone is safe and it\u2019s quiet and to go out I feel too vulnerable. And it gives me a chance to say, you know, really, I don\u2019t think we can become too vulnerable. I\u2019m waiting for the time that the whole world is suddenly too vulnerable and looks around and says, \u201CWait a minute we\u2019re making a very big mistake. We all have to stop. We have to share. We have to make sure there is enough to eat all over the world. We \u2014 we can teach each other our ways and tell each other our hopes and dreams, but we can\u2019t kill each other that doesn\u2019t work. And we can\u2019t kill the earth. And we can\u2019t despoil it as we are doing.\u201D So in a sense that\u2019s a half of an answer, Krista, but because that\u2019s what I\u2019d say to an adult who\u2019s leaving a retreat. Right. To a parent, I say, you know, as a child who\u2019s growing up, inevitably they live in the world and they\u2019ll hear about things. If they live in a house that\u2019s relatively peaceful and we have a certain amount of control as parents about how much the TV is on and what\u2019s on the TV and how much they are confronted by the pain of the world, and you know what I think? Since for myself, really, I can\u2019t \u2014 sometimes the pain of the world seems incomprehensible and unbearable to me, but I think if there\u2019s anything that balances it, it\u2019s the wonder at the world, the amazingness of people, how resilient they are, how people will take care of people that they don\u2019t know. If somebody falls or someone\u2019s in trouble in a public place, people take care of them. People take care of people that they don\u2019t know. That human beings have that ability. I don\u2019t think they have to learn it. They don\u2019t have to have lessons. I think we\u2019re an companionable species, for the most part. Every once in a while, we meet hermit-type people, but for the most part, we\u2019re companionable and congenial and we care about other people and we take care of them. So to be able to look at human beings and say human beings are amazing, life is amazing. The sun came up in the exact right place this morning and celebrates seasons. I think that\u2019s a wonderful part of being part of a group of people who celebrate seasons and birthdays and holy days. So that here we are again at another time in another season and there\u2019s that great cosmos out there to look at and imagine people going up into space and looking at the stars. Our ancestors looked at the same stars. I think that there\u2019s a way of \u2014 if I keep in myself a sense of amazement, I tell my grandchildren, \u201CLook at this moon. It\u2019s a three-day moon. It\u2019s the best moon. It\u2019s better than a two-day moon. A two-day moon is kind of skimpy. You really can\u2019t see it yet. And a four-day moon? Oh, it\u2019s already like on its way to a moon, but a three-day moon is just beautiful. It\u2019s my favorite moon.\u201D And if I show that to them, then they begin to think, \u201COh, it\u2019s my favorite moon, a three-day moon.\u201D That just happens to be me. I like moons. Everybody will do it in their own way. I think that all these balances \u2014 when the Buddha taught about needing to see the suffering in the world so that we could respond with compassion, he also talked about the preciousness of life and the need to take care of it, and I think they\u2019re both. Cultivating those two at the same time. I mean, that\u2019s also something I think our children give us new eyes, especially when they\u2019re very little, to see the world. Actually Trent, my colleague, was talking about taking a walk with his son the other day. I remember those moments when your children are little and it\u2019s like everything has been invented for them, right, and they name it and everything is fascinating. Yeah, yeah. Right. You can look at one flower for a long time because it\u2019s amazing when they start to do that. This is also making me think about how we need to be attentive to what our children can teach us, as well as what we want to impart to them because some of this they know and they actually know more immediately than we do, because we lose it. I remember watching something terrible on the news the other day. And my daughter said, \u201CSo many beautiful lives in the world and this is what they focus on.\u201D Well, you know, I think the beautiful and wonderful lives in the world \u2014 I certainly am not a sociologist of journalism \u2014 aren\u2019t as compelling images as the others. They don\u2019t make good headlines. They don\u2019t make good headlines. You know, it would be wonderful \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it would be commercially viable if there were a channel that had all wonderful things in the news. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to make good news sexy. It is. I think about this a lot as a journalist. But somebody could do that. Some entrepreneur could figure it out. Maybe. But, you know, but I think it\u2019s like kindness. It\u2019s the stuff of moments, but it can be absolutely transformative in moments and these beautiful lives are transformative in moments. But we have to train ourselves to look for them. You know, there were two things that you just said. One of them is that when we are really paying attention which is what mindfulness is, we really connect with other people. You know, lots \u2014 lots of times I think, for reasons of rush or whatever, even with our own children, we\u2019re not completely there. I have a friend whose grandchild said to him \u2014 a grandchild with whom he spends a lot of time, he was visiting and staying at the house and doing whatever \u2014 said to him, \u201CGrandpa, do you love me?\u201D He said, \u201COf course, I love you. You do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201D He said, \u201CYes, but I don\u2019t feel it when you aren\u2019t paying attention to me.\u201D So there is something about really paying attention. Yeah. What seems most clear to me is that children pick up what their parents live. My friend Jim Finley, who\u2019s a Christian contemplative psychotherapist, said, \u201CI learned to pray sitting next to my mother in church.\u201D And what I understood from him is that he didn\u2019t learn the words of the prayer; he learned the feelings out of her body as she sat there. I think that children learn that from us. Spirituality doesn\u2019t look like sitting down and meditating. Spirituality looks like folding the towels in a sweet way and talking kindly to the people in the family even though you\u2019ve had a long day. Or even saying to them, \u201CListen, I\u2019ve had such a long day, but it would be really wonderful if I could just fold these \u2014 I\u2019d really love folding these towels quietly if you all are ready to go bed without me,\u201D or whatever it is. But I \u2014 I actually think that spiritual parenting \u2014 people often say to me, \u201CI have so many things that take up my day. I don\u2019t have time to take up a spiritual practice.\u201D And the thing about being a parent who might think of themselves as a wise parent or a spiritual parent doesn\u2019t take extra time. It\u2019s enfolded into the act of parenting. You fold the towels in a sweet way. It doesn\u2019t take extra time. So Sylvia, one thing following on that. Lovingkindness meditation is also towards one\u2019s self. You share a story in your writing about precisely that, but you share what you often say to yourself when you\u2019re in a moment of anxiety. OK. So I think this is just great advice. I\u2019m going to hang onto this. \u201CSweetheart, you are in pain. Relax, take a breath, let\u2019s pay attention to what is happening, then we\u2019ll figure out what to do.\u201D I think that\u2019s a fabulous sentence for one\u2019s self and for one\u2019s children. I\u2019m so pleased that you found that. It\u2019s tremendously pleasing to me because I meet people in some significant numbers who tell me that they say to themselves in moments of distress. I say \u2014 they say, \u201CI say to myself, \u2018Sweetheart, you\u2019re in pain. Relax, take a breath.'\u201D I love that. A whole bunch of people out there saying to themselves, \u201CSweetheart.\u201D As I promised, I want to end with a poem. We\u2019re going to let Pablo Neruda have the last word, because you mentioned this in your writing as a poem that you always have with you. And I printed it out and I \u2014 I think it\u2019s beautiful and I wonder if you\u2019d give that \u2014 leave that as a gift for all the rest of us. This is called \u201CKeeping Quiet.\u201D Now we will count to twelve and we will all keep still. For once on the face of the earth, let\u2019s not speak in any language; let\u2019s stop for a second, and not move our arms so much. It would be an exotic moment, without rush, without engines; we would all be together in a sudden strangeness. Fishermen in the cold sea would not harm whales and the man gathering salt would not look at his hurt hands. Those who prepare green wars, wars with gas, wars with fire, victories with no survivors, would put on clean clothes and walk about with their brothers in the shade, doing nothing. What I want should not be confused with total inactivity. Life is what it is about; If we were not so single-minded about keeping our lives moving, and for once could do nothing, perhaps the huge silence might interrupt this sadness of never understanding ourselves and of frightening ourselves with death. Now I\u2019ll count up to twelve and you keep quiet and I will go. Thank you, Sylvia Boorstein, and thanks to all of you.
