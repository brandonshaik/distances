  "fullText": "Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s name is synonymous with her fantastically best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love. But she started out writing for publications by men and for men. Eat Pray Love was borne of a moment of total collapse in her life. And you can call it \u201Cchick lit\u201D \u2014 but it\u2019s inspired millions to move forward with their lives differently. Through the disorienting process of becoming a global celebrity, Elizabeth Gilbert has reflected deeply on the gift and challenge of creativity. She defines creativity \u2014 in life as in art \u2014 as choosing the path of curiosity over the path of fear. This has resonance for our common life too \u2013 and she says it\u2019s not to be confused with the more familiar trope to follow your passion. I think curiosity is our friend that teaches us how to become ourselves. And it\u2019s a very gentle friend, and a very forgiving friend, and a very constant one. Passion is not so constant, not so gentle, not so forgiving, and sometimes not so available. And so when we live in a world that has come to fetishize passion above all, there\u2019s a great deal of pressure around that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Elizabeth Gilbert has written widely in her career from The New York Times to O Magazine to GQ. She has published 7 books, including most recently Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear. She grew up on a small working family Christmas tree farm in Litchfield, Connecticut. So, I kind of resisted interviewing you earlier because there was a time when Eat, Pray, Love was everywhere. And what I\u2019ve been so interested in is watching this evolution and development of you, into, through, and beyond that. And so watching how you\u2019re processing that, and how you\u2019re articulating what you\u2019re learning about life, and kind of inhabiting this role you have in people\u2019s lives \u2014 whether you ask for it or not. And so much of that coalesces around this idea of what it means to be creative and, I think, kind of demystifying that. And then \u2014 so, on the one hand, demystifying creativity \u2014 what did you say? What\u2019s your definition? Creative living\u2026 \u2026is choosing the path of curiosity over the path of fear, which is pretty straightforward. Yeah. But also using the language of \u201Cmagic,\u201D right? Yeah. In your latest book, Big Magic. So, on the one hand, demystifying it, and on the one hand, revealing it as magic, but kind of everyday attainable magic. Practical magic. I think there\u2019s even a thing such as that, isn\u2019t there? Yeah. You know, I do think that just because something is mystical doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t also be demystified. [laughs] And maybe it\u2019s the mystical things that we need to demystify the most in order to lay claim to them \u2014 and to not keep thinking of them as something that only belongs to a very special class of people. The more mystical and precious, in a way, that we make creativity and spirituality both, the more people get left out of it. And I think that\u2019s a pity, and a loss, and sometimes even a tragedy. So it should be that all are invited, or else, what are we even doing here? You know? Just starting to read you on this, it brought back \u2014 I mean, I grew up in a very small town in a kind of what feels like a faraway place. I mean \u2014 and I wonder, actually, if a lot of people have this experience. And I just thought it was so singular to me that I was fascinated with the whole idea of creativity, but it was almost more like a longing than a fascination. And I wanted to understand it, and I wanted to be it. But I saw it as something that was somewhere out there in the world in other people, right? Right. And that you had to be, in some special way, gifted; in some special way, original \u2014 an artist. And that didn\u2019t feel attainable to me, or to describe me. And it seems like people are coming \u2014 a lot of people come to you with precisely that longing and feeling of being left out of the experience of creativity. Yeah. Most people are left out of it, which is not even the right way to say it. Most people are cast out of it because I think it\u2019s innate. And I think the evidence that it\u2019s innate is pretty airtight. And that evidence is multifold, but here\u2019s some pieces of it. One, all of your ancestors were creative \u2014 all of them. You and I and everybody we know were descended from tens of thousands of years of makers. The entire world, for better or for worse, has been altered by the human hand, by human beings doing this weird and irrational thing that only we do amongst all our peers in the animal world, which is to waste our time making things that nobody needs, making things that nobody needs, making things a little more beautiful than they have to be, altering things, changing things, building things, composing things, shaping things. This is what we do. We\u2019re the making ape. And no one is left out of the inheritance of that. That\u2019s our shared human inheritance. And another really strong piece of evidence is that every human child is born doing this stuff innately. It\u2019s an instinct. There\u2019s no child that you put crayons and paper in front of who doesn\u2019t get it, what you\u2019re supposed to do. No four-year-old boy was ever sat in front of a pile of Legos and said, \u201CI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m not feeling it.\u201D Right. You know, \u201CI\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t know if can ever do\u2026\u201D Right. Or, \u201CI\u2019m not a Lego master, so I won\u2019t even try.\u201D You know, \u201CI\u2019m not as good. Or like last week, I did one that\u2019s so good. I don\u2019t know if I can ever do another good one.\u201D Right, right. And I think what we find often happens is that most people that I talk to can usually pinpoint, with quite specific accuracy, moments in their lives where certain artistic expressions were taken away from them. Where, suddenly, they were informed that they were not a good singer, or they couldn\u2019t dance, or that they couldn\u2019t draw. And there\u2019s usually some shaming around it, often some public shaming. Somebody decides along the way, \u201CWell, no, Heather is the creative one.\u201D \u201CJoshua is the creative one. She\u2019s good at music. He\u2019s a good artist.\u201D And you get pushed out of it in a way. And the other weird side effect of that is that those special kids who get shunted into the category of being artistic or quote/unquote \u201Ccreative,\u201D they often become neurotic basket cases. Because it\u2019s a great deal of pressure to put upon two kids out of 100, to say, \u201CYou\u2019re the special one. Now go deliver unto us our artistic dreams that nobody else is allowed to do.\u201D You know, it\u2019s so crazy. Well, right. And it also does have that \u2014 you\u2019re right. Even when we cultivate and celebrate that, it has an effect of separating it out from everybody else, and it becomes something that only special people do. And it becomes something that is not part of you and part of your daily life. It\u2019s not embroidered within you. It\u2019s not natural to you. It\u2019s some artificial thing that you then have to get very expensive training in. And then you have to immediately start worrying about whether you can make a career out of this, and whether you can make money out of this, and whether you\u2019ll get acclaim from this, and whether you can continue to be recognized for this. And all of that is a very strange way to see creativity. And I would say a very new way. And by \u201Cnew,\u201D I mean post-enlightenment, the last couple hundred years, and very Western. And I would also say very macho in a way, very male. Because it comes with this grandiosity that\u2019s on the individual, and this pressure to be great and to be a genius. And it\u2019s strange. And also that has to have some kind of quantifiable, demonstrable value that is defined in certain kind of linear ways \u2014 what value is. Right. Yeah. So I think one thing \u2014 and I think you also \u2014 it took you a little while to come to this. One thing that you have started to say that is really helpful is that you\u2019ve started to see the danger of this refrain that\u2019s everywhere out there in our culture to follow your passion, follow your passion. And that that also becomes a way that people feel themselves excluded because they\u2019re not sure what their artistic passion would be. Or again, if it\u2019s their passion, can they really measure the value they\u2019re creating? And I love the language of \u201Ccuriosity\u201D you use, and I\u2019d love for you to talk some more about that. I mean, one thing you\u2019ve said is the difference between passion and curiosity as something you\u2019re following is that \u201Ccuriosity is a milder, quieter, more welcoming, and more democratic entity.\u201D Oh, I love curiosity our friend. I mean, I think curiosity is our friend that teaches us how to become ourselves. And it\u2019s a very gentle friend, and a very forgiving friend, and a very constant one. Passion is not so constant, not so gentle, not so forgiving, and sometimes not so available. And so when we live in a world that has come to fetishize passion above all, there\u2019s a great deal of pressure around that. And I think if you don\u2019t happen to have a passion that\u2019s very clear, or if you have lost your passion, or if you\u2019re in a change of life where your passions are shifting or you\u2019re not certain, and somebody says, \u201CWell, it\u2019s easy to solve your life, just follow your passion.\u201D [laughs] I do think that they have harmed you because it just makes people feel more excluded, and more exiled, and sometimes like a failure. Yes, exactly. And it\u2019s a little bit like \u2014 gosh, I mean, even the word \u201Cpassion\u201D has this sort of sexual connotation that there\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m much more interested in intimacy. And in growing a relationship than everything has to be setting your head on fire. And curiosity is an impulse that just taps you on the shoulder very lightly and invites you to turn your head a quarter of an inch and look a little closer at something that has intrigued you. And it may not set your head on fire. It may not change your life. It may not change the world. It may not even line up with previous things that you\u2019ve done or been interested in. It may seem very random and make no sense. And I think the reason people end up not following their curiosity is because they\u2019re waiting for a bigger sign. And your curiosities sometimes are so mild and so strange. And so \u2014 almost nothing, right? It\u2019s a little trail of breadcrumbs that you can overlook if you\u2019re looking up at the mountaintop waiting for Moses to come down and give you a sign from God. Yeah. Right. As you said, it gives you \u2014 curiosity gives you clues. It\u2019s clues and\u2026 Doesn\u2019t necessarily give you a destination at all, right? It doesn\u2019t. And here\u2019s the thing. Sometimes following your curiosity will lead you to your passion. Sometimes it won\u2019t, and then guess what? That\u2019s still totally fine. You\u2019ve lived a life following your curiosity. You\u2019ve created a life that is a very interesting thing, different from anybody else\u2019s. And your life itself then becomes the work of art, not so much contingent upon what you produced, but about a certain spirit of being that I think is a lot more interesting and also a lot more sustainable. Yeah. You use the language \u201Cthe virtue of inquisitiveness.\u201D That\u2019s great. It\u2019s everything. Yeah. I think a definition of an interesting person is an interested person. I\u2019ve never met an interesting person who\u2019s not also an interested person. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, exploring creativity and the virtue of curiosity with author Elizabeth Gilbert. Another phrase that feels pivotal for you, as you have thought about a life of creativity and all the manifestations that can take \u2014 this language of \u201Cstubborn gladness.\u201D And you\u2019ve taken it from a poet, who I had never heard of, with whom you share a name, Jack Gilbert. So, here are these lines of the poet Jack Gilbert. \u201CWe must risk delight. We can do without pleasure, but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of the world.\u201D Good \u2014 I just got \u2014 I have the words \u201Cstubborn gladness\u201D tattooed on my arm. Do you really? I do, yeah. Because I think it\u2019s everything. And the reason I love that poem so much is that, again, he doesn\u2019t deny. I mean, he puts those words \u201Cstubbornness\u201D and \u201Cgladness\u201D right inside the phrase about the ruthless furnace of the world. You know? He doesn\u2019t pretend \u2014 I know the first line of that poem is, \u201CSuffering everywhere,\u201D right? It\u2019s the first line, \u201CSuffering everywhere.\u201D Look. It\u2019s everywhere. There\u2019s no denial of that. And yet, something in us, something in the universe, there\u2019s some sort of spirit that also wants to be glad, and also wants to be amazed, and also wants to be engaged. And we can\u2019t lose that because then we\u2019ve lost everything. He has another line in there, which I don\u2019t know if I know by heart, but it\u2019s something about \u2014 \u201CTo only give your attention to darkness and suffering is to worship the devil\u201D or \u201Cto give your power to the devil.\u201D And you know, you have to be careful about this, especially when you have an impulse to be a good person, a quote/unquote \u201Cgood person.\u201D And your definition of a good person is somebody who gives everything to others. It\u2019s a beautiful impulse, but if it\u2019s done from a place of only giving darkness and suffering your attention, then you become somebody who\u2019s very difficult to be around. There\u2019s a lovely line that this British columnist said one time that, \u201CYou can always tell people who live for others by the anguished expressions on the faces of the others.\u201D There\u2019s some heaviness in there that just spreads out of you and makes everyone feel heavy, and even makes the people that you\u2019re serving feel heavy, because they feel like they\u2019re a burden and a responsibility. And so, if you can find the gladness and the lightness, I think your service becomes better, and I think your art becomes better, and I think your worship becomes better and lighter. And I think there is that dynamic, that dialectic in the way you approach your creative process, holding those things in a creative tension, the gladness and the furnace, our stubborn gladness against the world\u2019s ruthless furnace. And that kind of is a way to talk about \u2014 to get into the kind of very mysterious process of creation. I mean, when you talk about how you write \u2014 when you\u2019re writing \u2014 I think you say you don\u2019t write every day. Who was it \u2014 Graham Greene that always wrote 500 words a day? Was it 500 words? Yeah. A thousand? I don\u2019t know. For years, I thought, \u201CWell if I\u2019m not writing my 500 words\u2026\u201D because anybody should be able to do it. If you can\u2019t do that, then I\u2019m not\u2026 Yeah. But you said you don\u2019t write every day. You write by season. Yeah. You write book by book. But when you\u2019re writing, you\u2019re kind of back on the Christmas tree farm, right? I mean, you are getting up early, and going to work, and taking care of really granular things about your well-being and the \u2014 I mean, talk a little bit about that. Yeah, the Christmas tree farm is a great metaphor. And I think one of the reasons that both my sister and I ended up being authors is because we were taught how to do boring things for a long time. Yeah. You know? And I think that\u2019s really important because here is one of the grand misconceptions about creativity. And when people dream of quitting their boring job so that they can have a creative life, one of the risks of great disappointment is the realization that, \u201COh, this is also a boring job a lot of the time.\u201D It\u2019s certainly tedious. I mean, it\u2019s a boring job I would rather do than any other boring job. It\u2019s the most interesting boring job I\u2019ve ever had, but\u2026 But every job has boring in it, right? Yes, yes. I mean, I have a theory that I\u2019m just growing, and I haven\u2019t really put a roof on it, but I\u2019ll throw it out there, which is that everything that is interesting is 90 percent boring. Yeah. That\u2019s right. And we are sort of in a culture that\u2019s addicted to the good part, right? The exciting part, the fun part, the reward. But every single thing that I think is fascinating is mostly boring. So \u2014 marriage. I mean, good Lord, can there be anything more fascinating than joining two souls together in union and to spend a life entwined? Ninety percent boring. Then there\u2019s the reason why. There\u2019s that thing that happens, even 10, 20 years in, where suddenly you\u2019re like, \u201CWe never would have done this had we not stayed through everything.\u201D Raising children. I mean, I\u2019m not a mother, but I\u2019m a stepmother, I\u2019m a grandmother, I\u2019m a godmother, I\u2019m an aunt, and I know that 90 percent of especially being with very small children\u2026 Well, I mean, it\u2019s hard labor, right? Incredibly \u2014 it\u2019s hard. And then there\u2019s the moment where you realize, \u201COh, my God, this is a spark of creation that I\u2019m working with, and this is magic, and this is life seen through new eyes.\u201D And creativity is the same, where 90 percent of the work is quite tedious. And if you can stick through those parts, not rush through the experiences of life that have the most possibility of transforming you, but to stay with it until the moment of transformation comes, and then through that to the other side, then very interesting things will start to happen within very boring frameworks. Yeah, yeah. But somehow \u2014 and for some of us, this just comes with practice. I mean, you just experience it so much. I think it\u2019s hard to talk to younger people about this \u2014 for them to believe you. But how many of those moments along the way to something that you\u2019ll be able to say this was transformative, they don\u2019t feel transformative at all, right? They feel\u2026 No. They can feel messy, they can feel awful, they can feel like failure. Yeah. And so you need to trust that those can also be places on our way. Right. Yeah, well, trust is a big piece of it, isn\u2019t it? And I think motion is a big piece of it. I\u2019ve learned to give myself all the credit in the world simply for being in motion. Did you do something today toward this thing? Then you\u2019re good. Was it great? No. Was it fun? No. But did you do it? Did you keep the ball rolling? Did you keep another step on that path going? Then you\u2019re fine. That\u2019s it. I love that, just the idea of motion itself being a virtue. And because it\u2019s real, it\u2019s realistic, it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s nothing cerebral about that. But do you know that book by Annie Dillard, The Writing Life? Yes, I do. There are these sentences that I read there years ago, and I kind of put them in front of myself recently when I was writing this book, which was so painful. She said, \u201CAt its best, the sensation of writing is that of any unmerited grace. It is handed to you, but only if you look for it. You search, you break your heart, your back, your brain and then, and only then, it is handed to you.\u201D And I thought of that when I was reading, how you go back and forth in Big Magic, especially between \u2014 yes, you work like a farmer, and then sometimes, there\u2019s this fairy dust thing that happens. And it\u2019s both/and. Both/and, yes. Thank you for saying that because I feel like the choice, the false choice that people are given are these two ideas. One is that it\u2019s all coming from me. Nothing funny is going on here. There is no spirit moving across the the face of the earth. I\u2019m just a pile of DNA. My cerebral cortex is firing off and that is why my creativity exists, right? It\u2019s all me, it\u2019s only me. Which is great, except then how do you explain the mysterious part that you can\u2019t explain about why one day you were in flow, and it did feel like something was coming through you, not from you. And you brushed up against a sense of great mystery and communion. And then the next day, Wednesday morning, it was gone. That\u2019s just too hard to explain in very empirical terms. You know? And then the other choice you\u2019re given is the very hippie-trippy idea of \u201CI\u2019m just a vessel. I\u2019m just a vessel channel. It just comes through me.\u201D Then why am I so tired? Because I\u2019ve been working hard. So there\u2019s some sort of a \u2014 there\u2019s some third way. And I think the third way is \u2014 it\u2019s a collaboration between a human being\u2019s labors and the mysteries of inspiration. And that\u2019s the most interesting dance that I think you can be involved in. But you are very much an agent in that story. You\u2019re not just a passive receptacle. And also, it\u2019s not entirely in your hands. And standing comfortably within that contradiction is, I think, where you find sanity in the creative process if you can find it. Yeah, yeah. You have this wonderful idea that \u2014 I think this is partly the way you said it and partly the way I wrote it down \u2014 that our planet is inhabited by ideas, that ideas are part of the ecosystem, part of the biosphere, like other living beings that \u201Cideas interact with other animate and inanimate matter.\u201D And actually I think you talk about articulating that idea through an experience you had with Ann Patchett. Yeah. This is the most magical thing that\u2019s ever \u2014 and when I say \u201Cmagical,\u201D I mean it very much in the Hogwartsian sense of \u201Cmagical.\u201D I had an idea for a novel, and it was to be about a \u2014 I\u2019ll just summarize it very quickly \u2014 a middle-aged spinster from Minnesota who had been working at the same company for 25 years and was quietly in love with her married boss, who sort of \u2014 she was invisible to him. He gets involved in a very ill-advised scheme down in the Amazon jungle and sends a bunch of money and a person down there. And the money and the person disappear. And then he sends her down there to figure out what happens, at which point her orderly life is flipped upside down into chaos. And it\u2019s also a love story. And I wrote a proposal for this novel. I got a book advance for it. I started working on it. I was doing research for it. And then I got waylaid by some other things that were going on in my life and ended up writing a completely different book. And I left it aside. And when I came back a few years later, I found that the life force energy, for lack of a better term, the spirit of that book was no longer there. And around that same time, I met and made friends with the novelist Ann Patchett. And we had this very dynamic and exciting meeting where we sort of admitted that we loved each other\u2019s work, and she gave me a big kiss right on the lips. And we became pen pals, and we started writing letters to each other. And about a month later, she wrote me a letter saying she had just started working on a book about the Amazon jungle. And I told her, \u201CWell, that\u2019s so strange. I had been working on one, too, but it\u2019s gone.\u201D And then a few months later, we met, and she said, \u201CTell me what your Amazon book was about.\u201D And now she was 100 pages into hers. And her book, which of course became the extraordinary novel State of Wonder was a book about a middle-aged spinster from Minnesota who\u2019d been working for this company for 25 years and had been quietly in love with her married boss to whom she was invisible. And it was exactly the same story. And then we did that thing that pregnant women do where they count backward to figure out when conception occurred, right? Who got pregnant first. Right. And so we did the math, and it was really at the same time that I had lost mine that she had gotten hers. And we like to think that the idea jumped from my mind to hers during our little kiss that we had when we met. That\u2019s our magical thinking around it. But it\u2019s \u2014 there is no explanation for that. Other than the one that I\u2019ve always abided by, which is that ideas are conscious and living, and they have will, and they have great desire to be made, and they spin through the cosmos looking for human collaborators. You know, I was thinking \u2014 I had a conversation with Rosanne Cash once, and she started talking about the process of songwriting. And she was using this language, like, you have to have your catcher\u2019s mitt on, right? Similar thing. Oh, isn\u2019t that nice? And then she said \u2014 actually, I went back and looked at the transcript. And she said, \u201CYou have to have your catcher\u2019s mitt on. And sometimes I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t get it down, then somebody else will.\u201D And she said something like, \u201CIt might be Lucinda.\u201D Like, \u201CLucinda Williams might get this one if I don\u2019t,\u201D which is exactly the same thing you\u2019re saying. Yes. Exactly. And there\u2019s \u2014 look, this exists in the scientific world as well. Right? Right. There are these stories of simultaneous discovery. It\u2019s Alfred Russell Wallace and Charles Darwin figuring out the theory of evolution at the same moment. It\u2019s \u2014 this is something that we hear happening again and again, and it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I mean, I think it\u2019s something to just marvel in and be delighted in. You can listen again and share this conversation with Elizabeth Gilbert through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m talking with the author Elizabeth Gilbert about the nature of creativity. In life as in art, she says, it has less to do with passion than with choosing curiosity over fear. There\u2019s also kind of a noble guilt that one can have in this culture. And those of us who are fortunate to be able to buy and read books like yours, talking about bringing forth the treasures within us, and I was just talking a minute ago about how we also tend to be very focused, and kind of the messaging that\u2019s coming towards us is very focused on the ruthless furnace of the world. How do you respond to the question of \u2014 this creativity you\u2019re talking about, is this a luxury for privileged people? No. This is a shared human inheritance because the evidence of that is \u2014 again, let us look to our ancestors. And I ask you and me right now to think back to our great-grandparents. And they were farmers and workers, and yet, they made beauty. They made it because it brought them joy. They made it as a currency in the communities in which they lived. They made it because of the pleasure of doing something that\u2019s better than it has to be. So my grandmother, who made beautiful rag rugs and quilts \u2014 they\u2019re more beautiful than they need to be. And your history is filled with those people as well. And I would argue that most of the most beautiful and interesting things in the world that have ever been made were made by people who didn\u2019t have enough time, didn\u2019t have enough resources, didn\u2019t have probably any education. This is something that belongs to human beings who are behaving in the way that human beings are designed to behave. Using your senses and your curiosity and your materials and whatever\u2019s at hand to alter your environment and make something more beautiful than it needs to be. That\u2019s who we are. Yeah. That\u2019s really interesting to think about how \u2014 the way we have kind of dismissed art and creativity as a luxury is a way we\u2019ve diminished ourselves. Oh, good Lord. In huge ways, yeah. Without a doubt. I mean, I also feel like you don\u2019t make this connection overtly a lot, but I think that the notion of creative living and amplified existence, of creativity as a virtue for our public life as well as for private life, is very resonant right now, especially when you define it as a life driven more by courage than by fear, and what grows out of that. And you say, \u201CI want to live in a society filled with people who are curious and concerned about each other rather than afraid of each other.\u201D So kind of taking this virtue of investigation, of that gentle friend of curiosity as something that we can live by, would be good for us collectively, right? Sure. It\u2019s a public service. It\u2019s a public \u2014 yeah. Right? Well, I mean, I do think this is a very clear thing. Terrified people make terrible decisions. Terror and fear make you irresponsible. They make you not think very clearly, right? And they make you willing to do almost anything to get rid of that awful feeling. And we\u2019ve seen people do that on the individual level, and we\u2019ve seen cultures do that. And we\u2019ve seen politicians who find ways to exploit terror and fear in order to get short-term power or sometimes long-term power. Because if you can figure out how to hold the reins of other people\u2019s fear, then you can control them for a while. And so one of the very most powerful ways to not end up being controlled by that is to remain more curious than you are afraid. I think any time in the community that there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s keeping their head, I think it\u2019s a benefit to everyone around them. I think everything is contagious. Our fear is contagious, but our courage also is. And our courage makes other people be able to be more brave, and come out of their houses, and come out of their shells, and out of their fear. I think in this piece I\u2019m looking at, you were telling a story about being in Indonesia in 2002. And \u2014 so when did you publish Eat, Pray, Love? Was that 2006? Yeah. So, that trip I was talking about in that article was actually not my Eat, Pray, Love trip. That was a\u2026 So that was another time when your life looked like a dropped pie? Everything was on the floor in pieces? Yes. You\u2019ve had more than one of those? Well, actually, I would say that that was the middle of the period of my life that looked like a dropped pie, and Eat, Pray, Love was the end of that life. So this period that I was talking about was very much \u2014 I was still in the worst of what I ended up discussing in Eat, Pray, Love. That was dropped pie central right then. I would say that was the worst part of my life. Right. Bad divorce, losing your house, losing your husband, losing your money, losing your friends, losing sleep, losing yourself. And then this stranger, this woman just kind of gives you solace and nurses you back to life. And you said \u2014 and I feel like you\u2019ve had a lot of those experiences, partly because you put yourself out there. To be needy, to be alone in strange places. But I just love this. I want to read it. You said, \u201CI want to live in a world full of explorers and generous souls, rather than people who have voluntarily become prisoners of their own fortresses. I want to live in a world full of people who look into each other\u2019s faces along the path of life and ask, \u2018Who are you, my friend, and how can we serve each other?\u2019\u201D Yeah, that woman was so extraordinary. I had gone to \u2014 I had a very dumb idea, it turned out, that what I really needed was to just be alone and as far away from everyone in the world as I could get. And I went to this island off the coast of Lombok in Indonesia and rented a thatched cottage on the beach for $10 a day, and I decided for 10 days I wasn\u2019t going to speak. I don\u2019t advise that if you\u2019re in the state that I was in. What I probably really needed was to be around community, and maybe some therapists. Putting a magnifying lens on yourself when you\u2019re in distress like that can be very hard. And I ended up getting sick. And I used to take a walk around this island every day because it was such a small island. You could walk it every day. And it was a little Muslim fishing village. And there was this woman who used to be standing outside her house every time I walked by, and she would see me and smile at me. And she was the only human-to-human point of contact that I had during that time. And when I got sick, and I was stuck in my little shack very, very ill \u2014 I was afraid I had malaria, I was so sick \u2014 she came and found me. She had been keeping an eye on me, and I didn\u2019t keep my schedule. I usually walked around the island at dawn and at dusk. And when she didn\u2019t see me, she came and found me. And when she saw how sick I was, she brought me food. And I think \u2014 I\u2019ve never forgotten this woman. And what I think I learned from her was pay attention to what\u2019s happening in your community. That\u2019s what it means to be deeply engaged with the place where you live. Such that you will see when someone is in trouble. And there\u2019s ways that you can reach toward people rather than away from them. And you can do that. I know we talk often in this society about how terrible social media and the Internet is, but used properly, that, too, can become a tool of outreach, a way of knocking on someone\u2019s door. Yeah, we get to make it what we want it to be. It\u2019s us. We get to make \u2014 it\u2019s just us. And she set a real tone for me of how to be not so buried in your own problems or in your own distractions that you are incapable of seeing what\u2019s right in front of you and who\u2019s right in front of you. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s also actually a wonderful example of how when we kind of step outside ourselves \u2014 I mean, that was a creative act, right? It was an act of curiosity. Well, it\u2019s because the universe is looking for collaborators because creation\u2019s not finished. It\u2019s not something that happened in seven days and ended. It\u2019s an ongoing story that we\u2019re part of. And it\u2019s a much more interesting way to be part of that story to work in collaboration, and in partnership, and in friendly curiosity with it than to be terrified of it. I mean, look, life is a very risky affair. And what could be more fascinating and terrifying than this reality about a human existence, which is that literally anything can happen to literally anybody at literally any moment. And to live in the awareness of that without needing to drown it out, or dull it out, or suffocate it, or deny it is quite an exhilarating way to live. And then you can start to participate as much as possible in how that story unfolds. I don\u2019t want to finish talking to you without kind of noting the irony of the trajectory of your career and your persona and success as a writer. It was kind of interesting to me. I didn\u2019t really understand how much you had really written a lot about men and for men, and been a journalist, and been \u2014 I don\u2019t know, what is it? You once said you were like the only girl in the room a lot. Mm-hmm. And so that\u2019s not really the trajectory of, I think, what people would expect of this person who eventually writes Eat, Pray, Love. And ironically, that is such a phenomenally successful project. But you said once it had not escaped your attention that when you wrote about a man\u2019s emotional journey, they gave you the National Book Award nomination. But when you wrote about a woman\u2019s emotional journey, they \u201Cshunted you into the chick-lit dungeon.\u201D And I sense that you\u2019ve \u2014 this has been part of your kind of growth and reflection out of this. And I wrestle with this too with my work, like kind of pushing back against the idea that there\u2019s something unserious about talking about these things. And \u2014 yeah. So I would love to draw you out a little bit on that. Yeah. Well, I spent my 20s writing about men for men. And I wanted to. And it was very much a reflection of where I was in my life at that time. I was really interested in masculinity, and I think the reason that I was is because I wanted to be a guy. And the reason I wanted to be a guy \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean literally and certainly that\u2019s a very serious situation when somebody\u2019s born in a woman\u2019s body and wants to be a man. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. What I\u2019m talking about is I wanted to live the way men live. And the reason for that was because it was better. And I grew up watching what many of us grew up watching, which was men who had a great deal of freedom and women who followed them around and took care of them and took care of their every need. And when I looked at those two models, one of them seemed a lot better than the other one. Very clearly. And so I just threw myself into men\u2019s worlds. I worked in bars. I worked on a ranch in Wyoming for a long time. I became a writer for GQ, and Esquire, and Spin, very much men\u2019s worlds. That\u2019s right. I mean, I threw myself, not only into men\u2019s worlds, but into men\u2019s worlds where they were spending their life studying what is masculinity too, right? And examining that question again and again, what it means to be a man. I was just as interested in that as they were. And I felt comfortable in those worlds. And I mean, I even did a story for GQ once where I dressed up as a man for a week, and lived as a man in New York, and felt what that felt like, which interestingly, I didn\u2019t enjoy because I felt very constrained in that gender once I was in it. I much preferred being a woman among men, than being a sort of fake man among men. But what happened, I think, with Eat, Pray, Love is that it was a time in my life where I sort of came out of the closet as a woman. And I needed to because the questions that I was grappling with were very much women\u2019s questions. And there are certainly universal spiritual questions that I was grappling with, but the main one that I was grappling with and what ended my marriage was the question of whether or not to become a mother. And certainly that is the sort of ultimate woman\u2019s question. What does it mean if I\u2019m a woman who doesn\u2019t have children? What does it mean if I take a different path? Am I still a woman? These are all, in a way, gendered questions. And that led me to write Eat, Pray, Love. And although now we can say, \u201CGod, that just was such a commercial success, it just seems so obvious now.\u201D At the time, I was taking a very big risk because I quit my excellent job at GQ, and I took a very different voice on. And whatever acclaim I had in the world, or however I was known, I was not known as a woman who would write a book like that. So it felt very risky to do it, but I also didn\u2019t really have a choice. And I think, in the end, it comes down to that. And then, of course, I did get typecast as a chick lit writer. And I \u2014 that was year zero. Like all of a sudden, my whole history disappeared, and I just showed up as that person. And I\u2019ve sort of remained that person. No matter what I do from this point forward, I will still always be the woman who wrote Eat, Pray, Love, which is fine with me. But I\u2019m going to continue to write the books that I\u2019m called to write. I\u2019m going to continue to speak about the questions that ignite and illuminate my existence within myself and in the world. I\u2019m going to continue to serve the community who has gathered around me. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring creativity and curiosity with author Elizabeth Gilbert. I feel one of the paradoxes in your life and in kind of the spirit and presence you bring into the world is you are an explorer, you\u2019re a traveler, you\u2019re a famous traveler, and a famous explorer, I think, both literally and also in terms of your life as a writer. I also experience you \u2014 from afar \u2014 but experience you as someone who is so completely at home in yourself, very exuberantly at home. And you\u2019ve talked about, in those wild years that followed the success of Eat, Pray, Love, that finding your way home, that finding your way back home, that that was something you understood to be something you had to do. I don\u2019t know. I just want to name that, and I guess I\u2019m curious if that is a way \u2014 or how else you would want to talk about, through all of this that you\u2019ve lived and created, and also all the things you\u2019re hearing and picking up in the world now as you move through it, as this person kind of in conversation with our culture, what are you learning about that you didn\u2019t know before about what it means to be human? I think \u2014 here\u2019s what I\u2019m learning, and here\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing, and here\u2019s what I\u2019m lately focusing on and maybe even thinking about writing about. I feel like everything we want is on the other side of this dark river of self-hatred that is so prevalent in ourselves and in our culture. There\u2019s a story about the Dalai Lama that when he first came to the West and somebody in the audience raised their hand and said, \u201CWhat do you think about self-hatred?\u201D The whole sort of conference ended for a while while he had to have a couple of translators sit there and try to explain to him how a human being could be taught to hate himself. And he was so \u2014 he just said \u2014 there\u2019s this sort of transcript of his conversation in that moment of him saying, \u201CThis is very concerning.\u201D You know? And I see self-loathing everywhere I look in so many different forms. And it\u2019s so \u2014 it breaks my heart. And I also know self-loathing because I have been in it. Anybody who\u2019s been in depression knows what self-hatred is. In many ways, depression is \u2014 the best definition of it is anger turned inward. So, there\u2019s this battle that\u2019s going on within you where you become a rival of yourself and an enemy of yourself. And what transformed my life about that journey that I took with Eat, Pray, Love were those four months that I spent in India where I had to be alone with myself, and we really made a peace accord. And when I say myself, I should say my selves. Because we\u2019re not a self, we\u2019re selves. And one by one, I really went around to all my selves and we shook hands and made peace with each other and said, \u201CWe\u2019re not going to operate against each other anymore. This has got to be a better neighborhood to live in. We have to put down the weapons. We have to put down the old complaints. We have to put down the perfectionism. We have to put down the judgement. We have to put this stuff away because we\u2019re doing such tremendous harm to this poor being, Liz, who has to carry this war around within her.\u201D And so, I really came away from that trip having befriended \u2014 and the word \u201Cfriendly\u201D \u2014 I keep using it in this in conversation. And I use it a lot. It\u2019s lovely, it\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s a wonderful word, right? It\u2019s another gentle word like \u201Ccuriosity.\u201D I think friendliness is a nicer way to think about it. Can you be a little bit of a better friend to yourself? Would you ever allow a friend to speak of themselves the way you do in your interior moments? And so that\u2019s what changed everything. And even in the craziness after Eat, Pray, Love happened, I think part of the reason that I didn\u2019t get lost in that was because of the friendship that I\u2019d cultivated with this person who I am. And carrying that person around in a friendly way made those years easier than they might have been. And so sometimes people will say to me, \u201CGod, your life must be so crazy. Your life must have been so crazy after Eat, Pray, Love.\u201D And honestly, my thought is, \u201CNo, the craziness was before.\u201D The craziness was what you didn\u2019t see, what was going on in between my ears. That was the insanity. And when that\u2019s gone, then everything else that happens can be sort of ridden, and sometimes \u2014 as Jack Gilbert would say \u2014 enjoyed. Sometimes you can even risk delighting in it. But it\u2019s that spirit of stubborn gladness and friendly curiosity that I think is at the basis of \u201Cahimsa\u201D also, right? That you\u2019re a friend not only to the world, but to yourself. And there, you can find your way home, I think, in almost all circumstances. I hope. Because I don\u2019t know any other way. And that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve lived a while at this point too, and I don\u2019t think I have self-hatred, and I\u2019m not sure \u2014 it\u2019s hard to identify with that even though I would absolutely define some of my younger self in that way. But I \u2014 at the same time, you have this line about \u2014 and this is, again, about emboldening creativity, creative living, this way we can move through the world. And you say as kind of \u201Ccoming to the point where you can decide that the work wants to be made and it wants to be made through you.\u201D And I\u2019ll just say even as somebody who feels like I\u2019ve done a lot of work on befriending myself, but that\u2019s still a hard statement to claim for me and I think for a lot of people. It\u2019s an aspiration to be able to feel that way, to trust that. What gets me through those 90 percent of it being boring part of creativity without turning it into angst anymore \u2014 and I say \u201Canymore\u201D because I used to do it \u2014 is that faith that the work wants to be made, and it wants to be made through me. And so when it\u2019s not coming, and it\u2019s not working, and it\u2019s not being good, and I\u2019m stuck in a problem around the creativity, it\u2019s a very important shift in my life over the years to not think that I\u2019m being punished or that I\u2019m failing, but to think that this thing, this mystery that wants communion with me is trying to help me. And it hasn\u2019t abandoned me. It\u2019s nearby. And it wants \u2014 it came to me for a reason. That\u2019s what I always think when I\u2019m working on a project and it\u2019s not working. I think \u2014 I will speak to the idea and say, \u201CYou came to me for a reason.\u201D But in the meantime, I\u2019ll come to my desk every day with the faith that you are also at my desk every day. And that the two of us, this human being who is laboring and this mystery who\u2019s presenting itself toward me in whatever language it\u2019s able to, whatever signals, and clues, and hints, and inspirations, and the sense of obsession, and all the ways that inspiration comes to us, that it wants me to be with it. And somehow, if I\u2019m patient, and it\u2019s constant, the two of us, the idea and me, will figure out how to make something in the world. And through that process, I will become a deeper and truer version of myself. And so, regardless of how the outcome turns, it will have been worth doing just for the communion with the mystery and the idea. And I can\u2019t think of a better way to live than to just keep doing that.
