  "fullText": "Jon Kabat-Zinn is a scientist, writer, and teacher who helped create the field of stress reduction. He\u2019s clinically demonstrated the benefits of ancient traditions of mindfulness and meditation. And he\u2019s adapted these for mainstream Western medicine and society \u2014 for people who are healthy or living with chronic illness, for Olympic athletes and corporate cultures. Jon Kabat-Zinn offers wise perspective on inhabiting the ordinary and extreme stresses of our lives. Technology may function 24/7, he points out; our minds and bodies do not. But he has practical and spiritual tools accessible to everyone \u2014 for slowing down time and \u201Copening to our lives.\u201D It doesn\u2019t actually take any more time to say good-bye or hug you know, your children or whatever it is in the morning when you\u2019re on your way to work. But the mind says, \u201CI don\u2019t have any time for this.\u201D But actually that\u2019s all you have time for, is this because there\u2019s nothing else than this. So when your four-year-old can\u2019t decide which dress she wants to wear, that\u2019s not a problem for you, unless you make it a problem for you. That\u2019s just the way four-year-olds are. And the more we can sort of learn these lessons the more we will not be in some sense running towards our death, but in a sense opening to our lives. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being, from APM, American Public Media. Jon Kabat-Zinn is the founding director of the renowned Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. He\u2019s also gained a global audience with his books, including Full Catastrophe Living and Wherever You Go, There You Are. When I interviewed him in 2009, we focused in on my favorite book he\u2019s written: Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness. I\u2019d like to start with you. You know I interview theologians and scientists and artists and physicians \u2014 all kinds of people. I always start the interview by asking whether there was a religious background to your life, to your childhood. Hmmm. Well I suppose there was some background that could be called religious. You know I was born into a family that ethnically Jewish but that didn\u2019t practice at all. I was not bar mitzvahed and never set foot in synagogue until I was 13 and some of my friends from school were bar mitzvahed. So I was not brought up in the Jewish tradition. OK. On the other hand, I grew up in New York City in Washington Heights in a very sort of diverse community in the late \u201940s and early- to mid-50s. And mostly I played in the streets with kids who were Catholic and had their own ideas about Jews, and other faiths and so forth, and I didn\u2019t take it personally because I didn\u2019t identify with any of it. But as I got older, it had a very interesting texture to it, and I was certainly conscious of that growing up. How and when did you start thinking about or did you discover meditation and mindfulness? How did that happen? Well, sometimes I begin by saying that I was born into family where my father was a very highly recognized world-class molecular immunologist, and what was called in those days \u201Cimmunochemist,\u201D won lots of awards for his work, had a tremendous reputation \u2014 was a \u201Cscientist\u2019s scientist\u201D as many of his colleagues put it. Had one of his students win the Nobel Prize. And then my mother was as prolific as a painter as my father was in writing scientific papers and training graduate students and post-docs and so forth, but she was completely unrecognized. So I grew up in the classical C.P. Snow\u2019s \u201Ctwo cultures\u201D: the culture of science and the culture of art. And basically I was born into that. And so as a child I was, you know, it\u2019s inevitable that you have your eyes open and are kind of taking the lay of the land. And some of it involved seeing these different ways of knowing the world, through the eyes of a painter and through the eyes, if you will, of a biological experimenter. And they are very different. And so I think from a very, very early age on some level, long before I could actually articulate it, I was interested in the unity behind the divergences between those different ways of seeing epistemologies. Right. And that just developed as I got older, which is one reason why I was so interested in the arts as well as the sciences when I was in college, and the year that I spent at the lyc\u00E9e in Paris was like a renaissance year for me. So all of these threads \u2014 I mean, the reason I\u2019m telling you this is that all of these were actually extremely germane to finding my way into the meditative practices and contemplative practices, because in a sense I realized in retrospect later that they were a potential path for unifying what \u2026 I see. \u2026 Wordsworth called \u201Cdiscordant elements.\u201D That silence and reflection could actually tap into deep sources of understanding and wisdom that don\u2019t come necessarily in the traditional ways to the intellect. And then I think you\u2019ve said that you actually started to meditate at MIT, right? Yes, I did. Which is such an interesting sentence. That in itself is kind of \u2026 Especially 30 years ago or whatever, 35 years ago. Yeah. And the story, which I wrote up in Coming to Our Senses in part, because I put a lot of my own personal story in Coming to Our Senses and some of it\u2019s actually in various books, because I want people to understand that when they come to meditation that it doesn\u2019t mean you give up being a person and you become some kind of, I don\u2019t know, transparent weirdo of sorts. But that you change your relationship to who you think you are as a person and in particular to the story of who you are or think you are. And it seems to me that you spend a fair amount of your time demystifying meditation and mindfulness, in fact, presenting it as you found it, as a spiritual technology that can be akin to some of the creativity and openness to experience that you love about science. Oh, absolutely. And art. Yeah. In fact, I stay away from even the word spiritual. So it\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m into demystifying meditation, as it is, as I am into trying to make it so commonsensical to people that they will slap the side of their head and say, \u201CWell, of course. Why the hell didn\u2019t I know that like 30 years ago?\u201D Right. Right. \u201CThat makes total sense.\u201D Right. Because it\u2019s often freighted, even the word \u201Cmeditation\u201D is freighted with so much cultural baggage and so much, really ideological baggage and sort of belief baggage that the essential beauty of it is often really not apparent to people until long after they have somehow wandered into the domain of it. And my feeling was if what the Buddha said was true and that this is a path that potentially leads to the freedom from suffering and if everybody on the planet is basically suffering, why shouldn\u2019t it be accessible to virtually everybody on the planet as opposed to those people who self-identify as, say, Buddhists or as, you know, yogis or people who are into this or that? Mm-hmm. And so I tried to create a kind of glide path into meditation that would be so commonsensical and accessible and based on what people really need and also fear and are challenged by, that we could at least empirically test whether, if it was framed in that kind of way, regular mainstream Americans would take to meditation. And, in fact, I think the proof after 30 years is pretty much in the pudding that we do. Mm-hmm. So let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s talk about what you know as common-sense wisdom and let\u2019s talk about it in the context of our culture right now where there\u2019s a lot of stress \u2026 OK. \u2026 and there\u2019s perhaps a heightened awareness that we haven\u2019t been as mindful or aware. Yeah. Yeah. And so it\u2019s a moment of interesting positive possibilities as well. So we\u2019ve been talking to a number of people for this project we\u2019re calling Repossessing Virtue, and one of the people we called up was Sharon Salzburg, who\u2019s been on the program before. Yes. I\u2019m sure you know her. Yeah. We\u2019re close friends. One of the things that\u2019s clear to me as the economy started falling apart is the trust we had placed in the things that we assumed were logical and rational and in fact were highly irrational. Yes. So Sharon Salzburg makes a comment that in fact is so much more reality-based than our economic expectations and behavior for the last few years. She said, you know, as a Buddhist, \u201CChange and suffering are inevitable parts of life.\u201D And that\u2019s something we kind of forgot in these boom years, and we are so shocked that things could change. Talk to me about what we\u2019ve been doing as you understand that, both through the science that you do and the work that you do on stress. How you pay attention in your life actually can change your life and your biology and your brain. Mm-hmm. So when you don\u2019t have any cause to question what\u2019s going on, as you were suggesting in quoting from Sharon, and things are going in a direction that you describe for yourself as desirable \u2014 in other words, your 401(k) is increasing in value every year and so forth \u2014 it just seems like, yes, all is right with the world. And you can pay your mortgage payments and maybe buy a bigger house and on and on and on that this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And we tell ourselves that this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And then there are these rude awakenings that happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t have to be the collapse of the economy or the stock market. It can be as simple as, you know, something happening to one of your family members or yourself. Right. She said the phone rings, you pick up the phone and you have some news about an illness \u2026 And your whole life is different. \u2026 and your whole life is different. Yeah. Yeah. Whether somebody died or it\u2019s a cancer diagnosis or whatever it is. But we live in a kind of somnambulant expectation that everything will go on the way it is. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? And that is certifiably absurd. And so that, the stress if we loop it back to stress and the whole thing about mindfulness-based stress reduction, is that the stress really has to do with wanting things to stay the same when they are inevitably going to change. The law of impermanence basically rules the universe and so things are never constant; they\u2019re continually changing. And if you want to hold them a particular way, you can do it for short periods of time at tremendous cost, but ultimately things change. Right. And if you don\u2019t recognize that, then you\u2019re going to create a lot of suffering for yourself and other people. On our website, you can find that interview I mentioned to Jon Kabat-Zinn with Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzburg in our Repossessing Virtue series. That\u2019s at onbeing.org.I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring wisdom for living in a world of change with scientist and writer Jon Kabat-Zinn. Mindfulness is not about thought, right? I mean, your book \u2026 Right. \u2026 your very beautiful \u2026 Oh, you mean the word \u201Cmindfulness\u201D sounds like it\u2019s about thought. Yeah. It sounds like it\u2019s about thought. Good point. Meditation, I think the stereotype is it\u2019s about sitting \u2026 Thinking. \u2026 in your head. Right. Your beautiful long book that you wrote just a couple of years, you know, Coming to Our Senses, and you even pointed out that for the Buddha the mind is also a sense and it is all about being embodied. Exactly. Exactly. So talk to me about that and how that can make a difference in a moment like this where the world around us is so frightening. Well, we really haven\u2019t been educated to realize that there\u2019s a certain faculty that we\u2019re born with that is at least as powerful as any of the other faculties that we think about or know that we have, like the ability to think. We have never been trained in the ability to pay attention, for instance. We get yelled at in school for not paying attention \u2026 Right. \u2026 or when the teacher thinks we\u2019re not paying attention. Actually, we are paying attention, it\u2019s just to something other than what\u2019s on the blackboard or whatever. So attention and awareness are deep interior human capacities that never get any training or airtime or attention. What gets all the attention is thinking. And so when you begin to cultivate intimacy with these other capacities, it actually balances out our remarkable capacity for thinking and also for imagination and creativity. A lot of the creativity comes out of the stillness of awareness in not knowing. So rather than just sort of keeping tabs of what we know, it\u2019s really helpful to be aware of how much we don\u2019t know. And when we know what we don\u2019t know, well, then that\u2019s the cutting edge of which all science unfolds. Right. You\u2019ve also said that scientists make the best meditators. Yeah. Because they\u2019re comfortable with that idea of wanting to know what they don\u2019t know. But, you see, it\u2019s all a question of thinking. I mean, the word \u201Cmindfulness,\u201D for instance, I completely agree with you: Anybody who is naive to hearing it is going to think, \u201COh, yeah. That\u2019s some kind of cognitive manipulation.\u201D Yeah. So I like to point out that in all Asian languages \u2014 at least I\u2019ve been told this; I don\u2019t know all Asian languages \u2014 but in all Asian languages the word for \u201Cmind\u201D and the word for \u201Cheart\u201D are the same word. Right. Right. So when you hear the word \u201Cmindfulness,\u201D if you\u2019re not in some sense automatically hearing the word \u201Cheartfulness\u201D you\u2019re misunderstanding it. And mindfulness in any event is not a concept; it\u2019s a way of being. And it\u2019s a way of being awake. It\u2019s not a big deal; it\u2019s just that we\u2019re never taught that this is part of the human repertoire. So what does wakefulness mean? It means resting in a kind of awareness that is so stable that it\u2019s not thrown off by the comings and goings of events within the field of awareness. So that you lose your balance when things go this way and things go that way, but you actually stay grounded when things go your way, as we put it. And when things don\u2019t go your way, it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to rocket yourself or spiral into depression and hopelessness and a sense of despair. But very often if we take it personally and we feel like our successes say that we\u2019re a good person and then, by extrapolation, our failures say that there\u2019s something wrong with me, that I\u2019m no good. And both of those are wrong. What goes up also comes down, whether we\u2019re talking about the stock market or a ball that you throw up in the air. And if you mistake what you think of as the reality for the reality, then you\u2019re going to suffer because you\u2019re attaching the story of me, myself, and my successes and my failures to something that\u2019s actually quite impersonal. I\u2019ve come to think of meditation and mindfulness and yoga as spiritual technologies that these traditions have mined and kept alive and deepened. And as you say, they don\u2019t just present themselves in the modern world to Buddhists. They present themselves as keys to sane living. Yeah. Exactly. And yet, you know, I\u2019ve wanted to ask this question to someone for a long time. It seems to me you might be the correct person to ask. I mean, the Buddha left his wife and child behind \u2026 Oh, I\u2019m so glad you brought that up. \u2026 and devoted himself utterly to this pursuit of enlightenment. Monastics \u2014 a lot of the studies \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve been involved in these, but studies that I know you\u2019re associated with where \u2026 Yes. \u2026 they\u2019ve studied stress on the brain and they\u2019ve studied monastics and they find that they really change their minds. But, you know, they don\u2019t pay the rent. They don\u2019t live in fear of being laid off. Absolutely right. Absolutely right. They are renunciates in a certain way. Right. They\u2019ve renounced the conventional world. But anybody who thinks that\u2019s easy should try it for a bit. OK. And they find there\u2019s as much stress on that side as there is on any other side. Greed, hatred, and delusion are equal opportunity employers. Right. So just thinking of yourself as a spiritual person or renouncing the world, easier said than done. But that said, your point is very well taken and so the real challenge is how do we do it living in this world? Yeah. Without having to sort of abandon wife and children or husband and child or whatever and going off for the sake of our own small-minded, if you will, enlightenment? One of the things \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know this, but my wife and I wrote a book on mindful parenting \u2026 Yes, I do. Yeah. \u2026 about 12 years ago. And one of the things that we say in there is of all the spiritual practices, you know, no matter how severe the monastery and how arduous the particular practices associated with it, living with children is probably the most powerful spiritual practice that anybody could ever be engaged in if you open yourself to it that way. I like to look at them as when they\u2019re little as little living Zen masters that are sort of parachuted into our lives to push all our buttons and see how we\u2019re going to work with the challenges they throw at us in addition to, of course, having to put food on the table, pay the rent, build a career, have a loving relationship, you know \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 that is sustained over time and isn\u2019t merely mechanical or perfunctory. And this is like a really tall order. So I really think that in some way this is the best monastery. It\u2019s not a conventional monastery, but, you know, this is the perfect environment in which to cultivate mindfulness and liberative, you know, clarity, wisdom, compassion, working with the tools at our disposal. Rather than thinking, \u201CI\u2019ll leave my family and go off and be in a cave and get enlightened and then I\u2019ll come back and rescue everybody.\u201D Jon Kabat-Zinn teaches and speaks widely. Here he is leading an introductory meditative experience at Google\u2019s corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California, in 2007. OK. So what we know. We have a body, relatively speaking, and we\u2019re here now. So let\u2019s see if we can tune into now for no other reason than just for fun. OK? Just not to get anywhere, to be more relaxed, to become a great meditator, to break through, you know, some problems that you\u2019re having, whatever it is, but to just see if you can hold this moment in awareness. You don\u2019t even have to shift your posture; you just hold this moment in awareness. Now, there\u2019s a lot going on because, as I said, even if we limited it to five senses \u2014 if your eyes are open, they\u2019re seeing. Your ears you can\u2019t close so there\u2019s hearing. OK? Nose you can\u2019t close so there\u2019s some kind of sensing going on through the nose, some aroma of rug and wall. There is whatever the sensations are in the mouth. And there is the contact of the back with the back of the chair and your butt with the chair and if you\u2019re on the floor, you know. Let\u2019s see \u2014 and there\u2019s, of course, one aspect appropriate perception which is, interestingly enough, without any of it on our part \u2014 thank god, because otherwise we would\u2019ve died long ago for just, like, forgetting, getting distracted \u2014 we\u2019re breathing. So see if you can just feel yourself breathing. So if the mind wanders you know what\u2019s on your mind and bring it back. If it wanders 10,000 times you know what\u2019s on your mind 10,000 times. And without judging, condemning, forcing, blaming, just come back to this moment, this breath. Each breath a new beginning. Each out breath a complete letting go. And, voil\u00E0, here you are again right here. No agenda. Just this moment. Just this breath. Just this sitting here. Outside of time, if you will. The term that is used with kind of what you\u2019ve brought to medicine \u2014 you and others \u2014 is the mind/body connection, the mind/body interface. But really that\u2019s not quite big enough, is it? I mean, it still sounds like they\u2019re two different things. Yeah. See, again, there\u2019s this kind of paradox when you use a term like \u201Cawareness,\u201D which again sounds like a mental activity, but what you ask people to do and how they become aware is to drop into their bodies and their senses. Yeah. Drop into being. See, we call ourselves human beings. That\u2019s a big clich\u00E9, but we\u2019re more like human doings. Right. So we actually haven\u2019t had that much experience in inhabiting our own being. It\u2019s kind of almost foreign territory. And as soon as we do, we want to fill it up with something, even if it\u2019s, say, looking at a sunset. And then you\u2019ve got to talk about it instantly, \u201COh, you\u2019re seeing this. Is it as beautiful as I think it is?\u201D Right. And all of sudden, you\u2019re not seeing the sunset anymore; you\u2019re in your thoughts about the sunset. So whatever it is, our thoughts very often wind up carrying us away from the heart of the matter. And what these, as you put it, technologies or intra-psychic technologies, whatever you want to call them, offer us is a chance to continually return to what\u2019s deepest and best in ourselves. And it\u2019s not something you have to get by going to Harvard or working in the vineyards for 20 years; you\u2019ve already got it. Mm-hmm. And the body is a big part of it. And so the practice of mindfulness, whether you\u2019re doing it in some formal way, meditating in a sitting posture or lying down doing a body scan or doing mindful hatha yoga, but the real practice is living your life as it if really mattered from moment to moment. The real practice is life itself. And coming to all of those senses in hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and also we could say minding. Which is another way of saying awareness-ing. OK? And it puts us in touch with a whole different dimension than thinking. There\u2019s nothing wrong with thinking. Right. It can be incredibly creative and it can also be incredibly destructive. But awareness can\u2019t be destructive. There\u2019s a place in your book where you just really put a fine point on what\u2019s at stake. You know, that any moment in which we\u2019re not aware, any moment that we\u2019re not attentive to, is lost. I mean, and there\u2019s a \u2026 Yeah. You\u2019ve abandoned your own life. Right. There\u2019s a quote you have from Thoreau in Walden, \u201COnly that day dawns to which we are awake.\u201D \u2026 to which we are awake. \u201COnly that day dawns to which we are awake.\u201D It\u2019s the third-to-the-last line in the whole book of Walden. And, you know, this is a realization that he had, that you can \u2014 and this was even in the 1840s in Concord, which we might think of as idyllic. You know, he was describing the residents of Concord and the farmers as living lives of quiet desperation. So it\u2019s not just the email and the Internet, you know, and the World Wide Web that are carrying ourselves away from ourselves. This is something \u2026 It\u2019s the human condition. Yeah. It\u2019s the human condition. Mm-hmm. But I like to point out, if we have a moment for this, Krista, is that we call ourselves homo sapien sapiens. That\u2019s the species name we\u2019ve given ourselves. And that means from the Latin sapere, which means \u201Cto taste\u201D or \u201Cto know.\u201D The species that knows and knows that it knows. So that means really awareness and meta-awareness. And it would be nice if that were actually true, but I think it\u2019s a little premature to call ourselves that. And now maybe we need to live ourselves into owning that name by cultivating awareness and awareness of awareness itself and let that be in some sense the guide as to what we\u2019re going to invest in, how we\u2019re going to make decisions about where we live, where we\u2019re going to send our kids to school, how we\u2019re going to be at the dinner table. Whether we\u2019re going to take our bodies and our children and our parents for granted or whether we\u2019re going to live life as if it really mattered moment by moment. And that\u2019s not some kind of prescription for more stuff that you need to do in order to be happy. This is getting out of your own way long enough to realize that you already have the potential for tremendous well-being and happiness right here, right now. Nothing else has to change. One thing it does is it really slows down time. When you\u2019re in the present moment, time really stops. Well, that\u2019s interesting, because time is something none of us have enough of now, isn\u2019t it? Exactly. Just take an example: in the morning when you\u2019re on the way to work. It doesn\u2019t actually take any more time to make eye contact or say good-bye or hug your children or whatever it is, but we often feel so rushed that we\u2019re blasted out of the house. I was going to say, I\u2019ve been yelling at my children for 10 minutes to get in the car. \u201CGood-bye. I\u2019m out of here.\u201D Or yell at them to get in the car. I\u2019m not sure they want me to make eye contact. Well, exactly. And so we\u2019re so stressed that we\u2019re stressing out the children or whatever it is. But it actually \u2014 and the mind says, \u201CI don\u2019t have any time. I don\u2019t have any time. I don\u2019t have any time for this.\u201D But actually that\u2019s all you have time for, is this because there\u2019s nothing else than this. So when your four-year-old can\u2019t decide which dress she wants to wear that\u2019s not a problem for you unless you make it a problem for you. That\u2019s just the way four-year-olds are. And the more we can sort of learn these lessons the more we will not be in some sense running towards our death, but in a sense opening to our lives. And there\u2019s a huge distinction between the two. And all the scientific evidence is suggesting that when you choose life in the way I\u2019m talking about, your brain changes in both form and function, your immune system changes, your body changes. I mean, we start to really take care of what\u2019s most important and there are very, very tangible results at the level of the body, the mind, and the heart, and most importantly our relationships with the world and with our loved ones and with our own bodies.

Coming up, Jon Kabat-Zinn on the practical and spiritual implications of having Stone Age minds and bodies in a digital world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with scientist and writer Jon Kabat-Zinn. He\u2019s helped bring mindfulness-based stress reduction into mainstream medicine and society from people living with chronic illness to Olympic athletes to corporate boardrooms. We\u2019re exploring what he\u2019s learned through science and life, about mindfulness in the face of the ordinary and extreme stresses of our time. You\u2019ve been saying some very interesting things about the digital revolution. That we are saddled with a Stone Age mind in a digital world, and that has huge repercussions. Something interesting to me as I talk to people about taking stock of some of the larger implications of what\u2019s gone wrong in our economy and how we want to live differently beyond this is people saying, \u201CI need to take control of technology.\u201D Not that technology is a bad thing, but that somehow we feel that it has taken over. Yeah. What are you thinking about that? Well, I\u2019m struggling with it like everybody else. Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re the guinea pig generation. What do you mean by that? Well, in my lifetime there was only the analog world and now at a certain point, in the late \u201990s I think, you know, really for most of us, it became digital with the World Wide Web and, you know, all of that. So this is a gigantic experiment. It\u2019s never happened before on the planet. Everybody that\u2019s born more recently they\u2019ve only experienced the digital world \u2026 Yes. \u2026 not the analog world, as least talking about our country. So we do, I agree with you. I think we need to let that be in some sense an object of attention. We need to hold that in awareness and see how much the technology is improving our lives versus how much the technology is turning us into slaves of the technology, which it is certainly doing in a certain way. Because the technology is seductive. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed that, but it can be very seductive. And addictive. And after a while, between BlackBerrys and pagers and laptops and this and that, first of all, just let\u2019s consider what we used to quaintly call the \u201Cworkweek.\u201D Yes. There\u2019s no end to the workweek. Right. There\u2019s no beginning to it. There\u2019s no end to the workday or beginning of the workday. So we can work 24/7 everywhere. IBM brags about this in their advertisements. When IBM goes digital, the workplace is everywhere. Yeah. Great. Except that life isn\u2019t merely working. Technology makes this 24/7 reality possible but, in fact, our bodies \u2014 just our bodies, but our bodies and our minds and our spirits aren\u2019t designed \u2026 Exactly. They are analog. \u2026 to do 24/7. That\u2019s what I meant by a Stone Age body. Yeah. And the Stone Age mind in a Space Age world. So we\u2019re in transition here, and I\u2019m not knocking the technology. No. I\u2019m not saying sort of like we should go back \u2014 I\u2019m not taking a Luddite position on this. I think that technology is incredibly beautiful, and it\u2019s going to get more and more and more powerful and more and more beautiful. But there are issues associated with it that have to do with \u2014 the technology is in some sense getting more sophisticated than our understanding of ourselves as human beings \u2026 Yes. \u2026 without the technology. And what I\u2019m saying is that the technology is going to wind up changing us as human beings. And people talk about, like, what the future of this technology is when things will be so small that actually your computers, you\u2019ll swallow it and it will do things inside. Like, you know, you\u2019ll swallow your doctor or whatever, and they\u2019ll fix you from the inside. Right. Right. Or, you know, nanotechnology and all of that kind of stuff and then robotics. You know, we\u2019re moving towards a very strange world in some ways, at least so far that we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be. But one piece of it hasn\u2019t developed yet and that is our intimacy, our deep understanding of what it means to be human. We\u2019re still in our infancy as a human species. And before we start to talk about wet/dry interfaces where you start putting chips inside of the skull, for instance, to regulate certain things or upgrade our memory or whatever it is that might seem so attractive, that we really in the next few generations need to reclaim the full dimensionality of our humanity. My point is that maybe the technology will be a kind of mirror in which we can look and remind ourselves that there are aspects of being human and being analog that we don\u2019t want to give up to machines when they get smart enough to maybe pretend that they have feelings or look like they have feelings. Right. Or they\u2019re so bloody faster at calculations and computations than we are that we begin to feel insecure or inadequate in the face of our computers. When you talk about it this way, you know, when you talk about us being the first generation and being in kind of in an experiment, it brings me back to just a core Buddhist insight, that we have to have a compassionate relationship with those things that are difficult, right, with our fear. Yes. But also I\u2019m thinking with the stress that this moment of rapid change, this new territory, creates just by virtue of being new territory. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, you know, this is far too serious a matter to take too seriously. So it really has to be leavened with humor and a sense of humor. OK. That\u2019s good. Really. I mean, it\u2019s an ongoing engagement, so to speak. And since it\u2019s happening in a sense I think all of us to whatever degree and each in our unique way are being called upon to find out who we are and to live that authentically in the service of this world not just for our own particular small-minded gain or benefit. And I see that happening, you know, on a very, very vast scale. Obviously, nobody can understand fully what\u2019s going on at the moment, but the very idea that mindfulness would be of interest now as broadly as it is in the society, and that the number of papers with the word \u201Cmindfulness\u201D in the title in the scientific literature is going exponential, and the amount of funding that is funding research in mindfulness at the NIH is going exponential, and the fact that it\u2019s now \u2026 Right. And the fact that medical education is training to encompass this. It\u2019s also being brought into the military. It\u2019s being brought into business. It\u2019s being brought into professional sports. I mean, from the perspective of 30 years ago, this is basically inconceivable. And yet, it\u2019s already happened. And I think it\u2019s part of a much larger phenomenon from where maybe as a species, because of all the crises we\u2019re facing, we are in some sense tapping into that deep human capacity for waking up at the last moment and doing something right. And these resources that in fact have been cultivated in places for thousands of years. Exactly. And learning how to tap into them in a big way. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, Jon Kabat-Zinn\u2019s science of mindfulness. I was having a conversation with someone who is involved in the field of neuroeconomics. Have you heard of that? Mm-hmm. Yes. OK. And one of the things they talk about is that there is a natural human inclination to empathy, but one of the things that dampens that is stress. I mean, they can see that happening in the brain. Right. And they can run different scenarios and really stress people out and see how they behave. And I kind of connected some dots, and I don\u2019t know if this is just me, but I think one of the questions we\u2019re asking ourselves in this culture right now is it seems like all along the line, not just in the top levels of finance, but all along the way, people were making decisions that were irresponsible \u2026 Yes. \u2026 to themselves or to others. You know, mortgage lenders. Yes. Absolutely. And it made me wonder if one of the consequences of the rapid technological advance just of the last 10 years is this 24/7 reality, which is very stressful for us as human beings and that \u2026 Yes. \u2026 possibly just that had this very real and devastating implication of being \u2014 of making us make less moral decisions and then real economic consequences. And in that sense \u2026 Well, I think you may have something there. I mean, I still think that actually greed played a huge role in it, that it was just like free money \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 and wasn\u2019t so stressful. I mean, they were creating stress down the road for other people, but not so much for themselves. Yes, they are leading a stressful life, but it can also be \u2014 and this is one of the dangers and why it\u2019s so addictive \u2014 is it\u2019s intoxicating. You begin to feel powerful, sometimes extremely powerful because you can make so many decisions in such a rapid sequence and then see almost immediately the positive consequences of them for yourself. And it\u2019s the kind of thing where you really can get addicted to it. And I think then you lose all sense of moral judgment, compassion, even just clarity and become sort of entrained into a mind state that really is deluded. So the real challenge here is, as you posed it at the beginning, are we going to learn something that\u2019s going to really set us on another path or will it just be another recycle of the same old, same old? Right. And I think that\u2019s a big question, isn\u2019t it? It is. And I suppose that\u2019s where these kinds of \u2026 But that\u2019s where mindful leadership, you see, comes in. It\u2019s like you say Obama seems like a much more mindful president than any president that we\u2019ve had so far, at least that I\u2019ve had exposure to. Yeah. That\u2019s interesting, isn\u2019t it? And so who knows what that will mean? I mean, mindful doesn\u2019t necessarily mean perfect. Doesn\u2019t even necessarily mean great. It just means that there\u2019s some degree of awareness and sort of a deep understanding of interconnectedness that is dealing with \u2026 And emotional intelligence. And emotional intelligence that is, in fact, being brought to bear on these very, very intractable problems. That once the system gets into this kind of atrial fibrillation, it\u2019s very, very hard to get it stabilized. Let me ask you this. You\u2019ve talked about this kind of thing and worked on the basics of mindfulness at places like Google or MIT, you worked with the U.S. rowing team, Congressional staff, other businesses. I loved something you said at Google, that the key to creativity is cultivating more spaciousness in the mind. Well, actually, the spaciousness is already in the mind. We can\u2019t cultivate it. What we can cultivate is intimacy with it so that we actually know how spacious and how luminous and how creative and how reliable our own minds are. Now that\u2019d be good to start learning in kindergarten. You had your scientist father and your painter mother. Yes. And somehow you feel that the perceived disconnect or the differences in them made you want to reconcile and maybe made you more open to something like mindfulness. You know, you said at the beginning that being a scientist and being a painter don\u2019t have much in common, but in fact at some very deep levels they do have very intriguing \u2026 Oh, absolutely. I wasn\u2019t saying they didn\u2019t have much in common. No. I\u2019m just saying they speak different languages. Yes. But when you find those intriguing echoes between those kinds of pursuits. Yes. Then you find the unity. Yes. How would you talk at this point about that, about that unity, what that looks like? Well, perhaps rather than talk about it in a cognitive way, I\u2019ll give you a couple of lines of poetry from Derek Walcott and leave it at that. All right. Because it\u2019s, I think, better to point to it rather than to try to make some definitive prose statement about it which is bound to be inadequate and incomplete. So Derek Walcott is a Nobel laureate from the island of St. Lucia, a Nobel laureate in literature. One of my favorite poems of his is called \u201CLove After Love,\u201D and I\u2019ll just give it to you if it\u2019s OK. Yes. Please. It\u2019s not very long, but it really hinges around just this issue of who we are and how much we split ourselves apart. \u201CThe time will come,\u201D he says, \u201Cthe time will come when with elation you\u2019ll greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror, and each will smile at the other\u2019s welcome and say, Sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was yourself. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to yourself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you have ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes. Peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life.\u201D When you podcast this show on iTunes, you\u2019ll also find a special download of that reading by Jon Kabat-Zinn, of Derek Walcott\u2019s \u201CLove after Love.\u201D Jon Kabat-Zinn is the founding director of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His books include Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness and Mindfulness for Beginners. Here in closing is an excerpt from a presentation he made at MIT in 2006. There in 1966, as he likes to tell it, he began to meditate against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. He\u2019s returned several times in recent years, including once with the Dalai Lama for a conversation with scientists from various disciplines on investigating the mind. We call ourselves homo sapien sapiens, which means \u201Cto taste,\u201D to sense,\u201D or \u201Cto know.\u201D This is one of, I think, the great tragedies of our species so far is that so much beauty, science, art, music, poetry comes out of the human mind. And so much mayhem comes out of the same human mind, same human heart. In a sense \u2014 because in some sense we don\u2019t know how to run the apparatus that we\u2019ve been given and sometimes it takes over. And on good days just blinds us and we sort of make mistakes. On bad days, it blinds us to other people\u2019s pain, and we can create an enormous amount of pain in the world out of our own pain and of our own ignorance and out of our own ambitious greediness, I guess I\u2019d call it, to want things to be different \u201Cso that I will feel better.\u201D If we\u2019re not careful, we wind up with the kind of conceit that we are the center of the universe. It\u2019s an occupational hazard of being packaged in a body, that the whole universe is outside and you are obviously the center of it, and you relate to it through all your senses, including potentially this capacity for knowing. That, to me, is kind of a working definition of meditation. What is meditation? It\u2019s not necessarily stopping in the kind of usual way that we would think of stopping. Stopping is good and, of course, we\u2019re all going to be stopped, sooner or later the ultimate stop. We work a lot with medical patients who have tremendous suffering. Our track record with the dead is not so good. So one of the sort of cardinal rules of thumb is that as long as you\u2019re breathing, no matter what\u2019s wrong with you, from our perspective, there\u2019s more right with you than wrong with you. But can we learn how to pour some energy into what\u2019s already OK with us? Which you could call health in the most profound of ways, our own interface with not only the outer world but also the interior world of our own thoughts, our own emotions, our own sensory experience, in ways that would actually have some degree of balance, some degree of interrelationality, because all the senses are actually interrelational. And so, while you\u2019re the center of the universe, OK, so is everybody else. So is everybody else. So that means in a sense there\u2019s no center. Cosmologists know this. Topologists know this. There\u2019s no center and there\u2019s no periphery. But the question is what if we were to take the name we gave our species seriously and actually train to familiarize ourselves with the full perspective, the full dimensionality of what it means to be really human? For learning, for growing, healing, and for that matter, transformation across the whole lifespan. I wonder if you\u2019re hearing the same echoes I am \u2014 between Jon Kabat-Zinn and our recent shows with MIT\u2019s Sherry Turkle and the evolutionary spirituality of Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 a new desire we seem to have to reflect on our lives with and beyond technology. You can listen, download, and share all of these shows through our podcast page on iTunes or at onbeing.org. We will keep this conversation going on the radio and in those digital spaces that are so stressing and enriching us these days. I\u2019m doing lot of reflecting and sharing of ideas and articles on Twitter. Follow that @kristatippett. Follow all things On Being @beingtweets.
