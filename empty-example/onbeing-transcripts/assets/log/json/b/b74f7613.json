  "fullText": "When people would talk to me about, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna beat this,\u201D or, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna slay cancer,\u201D or, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna\u201D \u2014 I would say what I\u2019m gonna do, hopefully, is become more of who I was meant to be. And cancer has given me this huge, dramatic, turbulent opportunity to do that. Eve Ensler has helped women all over the world tell the stories of their lives through the stories of their bodies. Her play, \u201CThe Vagina Monologues,\u201D has become a global force in the face of violence against women and girls. But she herself also had a violent childhood. And it turns out that she herself was like so many of us Western women, obsessed by our bodies and yet not inhabiting them \u2014 without even knowing we\u2019re not inhabiting them. Until she got cancer. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Eve Ensler is a playwright, performer, and social activist. All of her work and writing revolves in some way around complicated, redemptive female physicality. Her book, The Good Body, includes a funny, touching reflection on her post-40s stomach. \u201CThe Vagina Monologues\u201D is also touching and funny in places and has taken Eve Ensler places she never thought she\u2019d go: to help create a transitional, healing refuge for women and girls in the Congo, for example. It\u2019s called \u201CThe City of Joy.\u201D And her emotional tie to the Congo played a mysterious role in her journey with cancer, as she describes in her book, In the Body of the World. I spoke with Eve Ensler in 2013. I always start by asking whoever I\u2019m speaking with about if there was a religious or spiritual background to their childhood. And I wonder how you think about that and that can obviously be \u2014 that can be an intentional religious or spiritual background or it can be the spiritual message that was coming into the fabric of your childhood. I mean, how do you think about that? Well, it\u2019s interesting because I had a very strange, in a way, religious background. I was brought up in a Jewish community with a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother, but I was brought up to be not Jewish in a Jewish community. So that was really fraught for me and also just strange, you know. And then I was brought up in the Unitarian church which I actually quite liked because it was an exposure to all ways of thinking and all religious thoughts. And the church was a very political church. I remember there were really great speakers who came, civil rights speakers and, you know, anti-Vietnam speakers. So it was kind of \u2014 I got this idea somehow that religion and social activism go together. But I don\u2019t know that I would call that my spiritual life. It was \u2014 they were religious ideas, you know. And I think my spiritual life was so much more through language and through words and through the body. It was always through the body and it was through dancing and it was through \u2014 I was a dancer when I was younger. I was a ballerina for years and that was a big part of it. It was finding the life, the spirit, in my body which was a very difficult thing \u2019cause my body was so kind of muted. Right, right. So how old were you when you first started to collect women\u2019s stories, that whole project that led to \u201CThe Vagina Monologues\u201D? Well, my friend told me, who I grew up with, that I used to do this at camp, that I would get all the girls to sit on the bed to tell me their stories. So I think it began very, very young. I was always obsessed with people stories, always. And I remember actually in fifth grade, I formed this club of all the unpopular girls because I was seriously unpopular and I brought them all to my house. I made them all tell me their stories about how bad they felt about being unpopular . It was sort of like \u2014 I think I always longed to know what was going on inside people, just what the secrets were, because I also wanted to know if there was another thing, another way, another story, another example, another path that was possible. I think that\u2019s been really therapeutic for the unpopular girls. I mean, they were so lucky to be in school with you . I tried to form a kind of rallying club, but, you know, unpopular girls are unpopular for a reason. We were all really thwarted socially, so the club didn\u2019t really happen because they weren\u2019t that interested. They just wanted to stop being unpopular and grow up and be something else. They didn\u2019t want to be \u2014 I remember when I worked for years in a homeless shelter and I would try to rally the homeless women to, like, organize and they were like, but we don\u2019t wanna be identified as homeless women, like this is a very fluid identity. This is not a permanent identity. And I think the unpopular girls felt kind of the same way . And then \u2014 so how old were you when \u201CThe Vagina Monologues\u201D project started? Well, \u201CThe Vagina Monologues\u201D happened in my late-ish-30s, but there were a lot of stories I was gathering before then. I did a play about homeless women called \u201CLadies\u201D where I interviewed women for years in a homeless shelter and then put that together. And I did a play about nuclear disarmament where I talked to women who were camping out in peace camps and I put their stories into a play. So I was already \u2014 I also think when you grow up in a family where you don\u2019t know really what\u2019s going on inside people, you know, everyone was so untransparent and so unavailable and so far away. And I longed to know what people were thinking. I knew someplace my survival was there. Yeah, yeah. And, I mean, it is a fascinating phenomenon that that play, that project, \u201CThe Vagina Monologues,\u201D that it really set this movement in motion where women around the world found a new way in to kind of claiming themselves and healing themselves and loving themselves and each other. So one thing that jumps out at me, and you actually talk about this at some place in your writing, is this power of naming. That really runs all the way through sacred traditions. I don\u2019t think we talk about it very much in this culture, but just naming itself, speaking a word and using words intentionally as something that actually is generative, creative \u2014 it brings things into being. It really does. You know, I used to joke about saying the word vagina, but it\u2019s like if you say it enough, the whole world changes and people change. And that\u2019s definitely been my experience over and over again with various words. But also the other thing that came through is when you ask a woman to talk about her vagina, it\u2019s not also just not that part of her body, right? It\u2019s the whole package. Absolutely. And I remember years ago reading like inside the story of a great autobiography is the story of humanity. And I think that\u2019s what started to hit me when I started to first talk to women. How many secrets, how many clouded memories, how many parts of ourselves were stored there that we had never brought to the surface. And you\u2019ve been \u2014I mean, you\u2019ve been so many places. You\u2019ve been all over the world with this, but I would like to just kind of hone in on the hold that the Congo has for you. It\u2019s also so striking because that\u2019s one of those places where the stories one hears through the news which are the only stories one would ever hear are so horrific. It\u2019s one of the hardest places ever to identify with in that abstract way. But what did you say once, you know, I was a goner for the Congo. So would you just tell us a little bit about the particular hold it is has? Well, I think for me \u2014 I think who knows what my life would have been like going to the Congo had I not been to so many other places before. I think you get prepared for landings. You get prepared for the moment when someplace enters you. It\u2019s that great Rilke thing. The future enters into us in order to transform us long before it ever happens. And I think the Congo was coming towards me for a long time. When I got invited to the Congo by Dr. Denis Mukwege who\u2019s this extraordinary surgeon at a fancy hospital, it was one of the things where I just knew in my being like I had to go there and I had to do whatever we could to support his efforts. I think when I got to the Congo \u2014 and the place is so beautiful. In Bukavu, it is just \u2014 there\u2019s a paradise of quality to it and a beauty in the land and a beauty in the lake and a beauty in the nature and the fertility and the lushness. Simultaneously, the poverty and the insecurity and the war and the lack of infrastructure and the chaos \u2014 it is so living in the center of the story. It is everything escalated to \u2014 so it\u2019s completely revealed. Like, there\u2019s no more lies there, there\u2019s no more secrets there. You\u2019re in it. And there\u2019s something both very disturbing about it, but also very relieving because\u2026 It\u2019s kind of the opposite of that experience you described beforehand growing up in suburban America\u2026 Yes, exactly. Where everything was below the surface. Nothing is in front of you. Nothing\u2019s transparent. Right. So in 2010, you are helping create something called the \u201CCity of Joy,\u201D which also just \u2014 that language again against the backdrop that you just described is very stunning. And you discover that you have a huge malignant tumor, right? In your uterus? And you had \u2014 you said that cancer landed in your body just as Congo had landed you In the Body of the World. And there\u2019s something in your story, and I know you know this, which is just so iconic for this great contradiction especially of modern women, I think, Western women maybe, how, on the one hand, attentive to our bodies and obsessed by our bodies we can be and yet not inhabit them and not even know that we\u2019re not inhabiting them. Exactly. And for you , this crusader going around the world with V-Day to make that discovery is just, you know, it\u2019s remarkable. Well, you know, I think everything\u2019s in stages and is incremental. I think my whole life, if I look at the body of literature and theater pieces I\u2019ve written, I think it\u2019s been this huge journey and attempt to get back into my body. I mean, every play on some level. But I think\u2026 Right. The body was always in there\u2026 Always. You know, I look at \u201CThe Vagina Monologues,\u201D \u201CThe Good Body\u201D \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s been a kind of obsession and it\u2019s really an interesting thing, I think. You think you\u2019re in your body and then you get cancer and you wake up after nine hours of surgery with tubes and catheters and all kinds of things coming out of it and you realize that it\u2019s the first time in your life you\u2019ve ever been in your body, like you are a body. You are pure body and that experience is so \u2014 it was just so incredible. It was so incredible to be in my body, to not have this be an abstraction, you know. I\u2019m also thinking a lot lately about, you know, how Descartes has so much to answer for. This idea, I think therefore I am, which sounds like a piece of philosophy, but our Western culture is so built around this way overly cerebral disembodied way that we\u2019ve created all of our institutions and we\u2019re so impoverished. We\u2019re so much smaller for it. So much smaller. You know, it\u2019s so funny that you\u2019re saying that because during my cancer, I used to just chant all the time, I feel therefore I am, you know. And I\u2019m in my body therefore\u2026 I feel therefore I am? Yeah. I feel therefore I am. I feel therefore I can feel my existence. I feel my body. I feel the breath. I feel the living, breathing fiber that is humanness, you know. And I think this notion of objectivity as if that were ever possible. Right. As if the brain could somehow separate you from your subjective self has created a level of dissociation on the planet. You can get yourself into some mindset which keeps you from opening your heart. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with playwright and social activist Eve Ensler. I was at a gathering a couple of weeks ago and there were neuroscientists there and artists, actually some poets. A poet from Sierra Leone and a poet from Northern Uganda, and a lot of the themes that you speak about were there, and there were contemplatives. And we talked about, again, to language, how the Buddhist word for \u2014 it\u2019s heart and mind. Heart and mind are the same thing. And when these Western neuroscientists first started studying the brains of meditating Tibetan Buddhist monks, the monks thought this was so hilarious that they were putting the electrodes on the head \u2026 As opposed to the heart. Yes, yes. Absolutely. But actually, the science is actually also helping us understand that our brain is an organ, right? And that what we experience as feelings lodge in our bodies as well. And nothing\u2019s separate. Again, everything got separated. But they\u2019re not separate. There\u2019s a direct line that goes from and to and I think that is to me the most exciting thing about being alive right now is rewiring ourselves and reconstituting ourselves to understand that this is all connected not only here, but outside of us, you know. Like that\u2019s the time we\u2019re moving into now, like where we get out of this. You know, you can\u2019t dominate people without separating them from each other and from themselves. The more people get plugged back into their bodies, each other, the more impossible it will for us to be dominated and occupied. And I think that\u2019s really the work right now. And I don\u2019t mean that in a narcissistic way. I mean like how in our daily lives are we connecting in every single respect with ourselves and everything around us because that\u2019s where transcendence comes from. That\u2019s where real energetic transformation comes from. Yeah. That\u2019s such an interesting idea too. I believe that also, but it almost sounds paradoxical that transcendence comes from being rooted. Completely. Yeah. You had this moment when you had so many things happen with your cancer and infections. I mean, it was a long saga. Indeed. But you had this former therapist who was a friend who said to you at one point that she was so surprised you hadn\u2019t gotten sick up to then, which kind of scared me because I sometimes think am I making myself sick, you know? But you said my body has been sculpting this tumor for years. This kind of brings it back into you, but tell me what you meant by that. Well, you know, I think ever since I got cancer, I\u2019ve been really looking at trauma, like what is trauma? What are the molecular, you know, particle. You know, what is it? What does it do to us? And I think even as I was very prone to sickness when I was younger, I was always sick. I was always sick because I was being beaten, I was being molested, I was being attacked, I was always under siege, so I was always sick. I saw myself as a sick person. \u2018Cause my body was absolutely metabolizing or attempting to metabolize all that trauma and was having a very difficult time with it. So it did what it did, which is got me sick. And I think we don\u2019t even know yet what the relationship between trauma and disease is and illness is. You know, I think for me I am surprised that \u2014 all the years \u2014 first of all, my own abuse and then self-abuse and then traveling the world and listening to story upon story, city after city after city, woman after woman after woman who really needed to share, and where was it going? It was going into this system, and how do we process it? To be honest with you, I didn\u2019t treat my body with mercy because I wasn\u2019t connected to my body. Right. There\u2019s also that distinction. You weren\u2019t making that connection. No. You weren\u2019t imagining that connection as real. Exactly. So where was all that going? What it was doing, it was building itself a little tumor. That\u2019s where it was going. It was just \u2014 and I\u2019ve spoken to so many women recently who are working, for example, on the front lines at rape centers or in Panzi Hospital, for example, I heard a story recently of the women who are the intake people who intake the stories. In the last, I think, four years, three of them have gotten cancer. And I\u2019ve just heard many stories recently, but then, of course, we don\u2019t even know the relationship between reproductive cancers, for example, and the number of women who have been beaten or raped or incest or abused. And since I wrote In the Body of the World, I cannot tell you how many letters I have gotten from women telling me about themselves or their mothers who were survivors of battery, who got cancer. They could directly see the relationship when the battery started, when the cancer happened. I think in years to come we will think of trauma and cancer and they will not be separate. We will be treating them. Yeah. I was always intrigued and kind of puzzled by this language. Not puzzled, but I felt like it\u2019s something we don\u2019t pay attention to when we talk about sexual violation in particular. You often will use the term \u201Csoul-stealing,\u201D right? I mean, we have this evidence before us that, when that kind of abuse happens, especially to a child, it\u2019s utterly destroying a whole person and it was never just a physical experience. Never. How many years has it taken me to piece by piece begin to reassemble the tissue of my soul, to reassemble the \u2014 you know. And if we just look around the \u2014 and I had resources to do that. I came from a middle class family where I had the ability to begin to rebuild that structure. I look as I travel around the world at women who are living in such incredible poverty and in situations where on top of the incredible meager existence they have there is an avalanche of violence. So how are they even beginning to reconstitute those structures, you know? And then there was this bizarre aspect of your cancer that it created essentially a fistula which is a very particular, but unfortunately very widespread malady in that part of the world that had so captured you in the Congo. Particularly for women who have been violated and raped. Right, as a result of rape and assault. I mean, it was the doctor at the Mayo Clinic who was amazed. I mean, I don\u2019t know if he used this word in your book, mystery, at the mystery of what they found. He said these findings are not medical, they are spiritual. I don\u2019t know. What was that like? I don\u2019t know. I was saying last night at an evening we did that I think one of the amazing things about love is that, if you allow people to enter you, they actually change you for better and worse. If you allow pain into your system \u2014 but I also believe that, look, there are so many women\u2019s stories that have been inside me and so much pain that had been inside me and it was what happened and got me sick, but it was also ironically what saved me because it was a longer river. Like that river was a river of connection. So living then to open City of Joy so that the women of Congo could have a place of their dreams was connected to me having gotten fistula which was connected. It was part of the same continuum. You can listen again and share this conversation with Eve Ensler, and subscribe to our podcast, at onbeing.org. Coming up: Eve Ensler on living her second wind, but before that, on chemotherapy as ritual. She writes, \u201CA hard foreign object under the skin separates you from those who remain only flesh. It gives you secret powers and access to a new world, a world where there are no more countries or claimed borders, where life happens and death is near, where the only real harbors are the ones we carry in our chest.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with \u201CVagina Monologues\u201D playwright, performer, and social activist Eve Ensler. We\u2019ve been exploring how this woman who spoke the word \u201Cvagina\u201D onstage realized she\u2019d never inhabited her body until she had cancer. I want to talk about a few other aspects of what you learned going through that experience of your cancer. I wonder if you would just tell the story of, like, beginning to see the tree from your hospital room. Well, I think when I was younger and went through so much violence, I separated myself from all the things that represented life \u2019cause life was too painful. Beauty, nature, love, children \u2014 none of the things felt possible to me. I felt like I had been exiled from that world. And although I looked at it longingly from time to time, I also looked at it with bitterness and the kind of cynical bad-ass self which was, like, I\u2019m on my way to the city and I\u2019ll never see another tree again. And I knew someplace it was really distorted and messed up, but that\u2019s where I was. And what happened when I got sick was I got a very, very bad infection after the surgery. And it was like a sea of infection in my gut and I was really sick and I lost 30 pounds. I was disappearing and I went to the hospital and I ended up having this lovely room \u2019cause it was my birthday. And when I got there, I looked out and the only thing I could see was this really beautiful tree. And I couldn\u2019t write, I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t even watch television. I was just a thing and I thought, \u201COh, my God, I\u2019m gonna have to face this tree, and I\u2019m gonna go\u201D \u2014 but what happened was that every day, every hour, it was as if the tree began to reveal itself to me. Or I began to see the tree or both those things happened together. And I fell in love with that tree. I loved the bark, I loved the trunk, I loved the branches\u2026 It felt like a contemplative practice that you entered into with the tree. It was just unbelievable. And by the end of my stay in the hospital, which was a few weeks, the tree actually blossomed these white blossoms and I felt like I was born back into nature somehow. Like I had been asleep, and I had awakened. And it\u2019s absolutely taken hold. I feel there isn\u2019t a tree I walk past where I feel like one of those people, like, \u201CWhoa, look at these trees.\u201D Really? They\u2019re just incredible. I can\u2019t believe how amazing trees are . I want to read \u2014 I just want to read this passage \u2019cause it\u2019s just so beautiful. To this point, I mean, you being very eloquent about what you experienced, really what you \u2014 these learnings. It\u2019s kind of long, but I\u2019m gonna read it \u2019cause I think it\u2019s beautiful. \u201CWhat if our lives were precious only up to a point? What if we held them loosely and understood that there were no guarantees? So that when you got sick, you weren\u2019t a stage, but in a process. And cancer, just like having your heart broken or getting a new job or going to school or a teacher? What if rather than being cast out and defined by some terminal category you were identified as someone in the middle of a transformation that could deepen your soul, open your heart and all the while even if and particularly when you were dying, you would be supported by and be part of a community? And what if each of these things were what we are waiting for?\u201D It\u2019s so beautiful. Thank you. What if our lives were precious only up to a point? Tell me what you mean by that. Well, I think this really began during 9/11 in this complete madness and obsession for security which we all know is completely elusive and impossible. And I think the way I feel is I am important and I love being alive and it\u2019s great to be here. But I\u2019m precious up to a point. I\u2019m no more precious than anybody else and my life has its time and its cycle and it will come and it will go. But my value isn\u2019t more than anybody on this planet. And I think, in the West and particularly in America, when bad things happen here, they\u2019re just so awful. But when they happen other places, they\u2019re anticipated or expected. We just assume things happen like that, as if the people aren\u2019t suffering the same as we\u2019re suffering when the bad things happen here. I remember once when I was in \u2014 I think I was in Kathmandu and I was by a river. Was it Kathmandu? I think it was Kathmandu. And there were these boys swimming in the river and literally very close by. There was a pyre and they were burning a dead body and the ashes were floating and the boys were actually kind of \u2014 they actually were kind of swimming past the boys and nobody was alarmed. Nobody was disturbed. Dead and living, the dead and the living. And it gave me this incredible sense of relief. It was like, yeah, the dead, the living. The dead, the living. It\u2019s not so awful. And I think in a way we in this country sometimes believe we\u2019re so important. Our comfort is so meaningful when it\u2019s no more meaningful or less meaningful than anybody else\u2019s comfort. And I think that understanding is very liberating. One of the big realizations that you came to was about the nature of love and I really took that in because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about also a lot. I mean, maybe at this time of life, in that extreme moment, the loves that we tend to focus on, you know, love with a capital \u201CL,\u201D the romantic love, the marriages, the lovers, that didn\u2019t really come through, that didn\u2019t feel very substantial. And yet you realize that that did not amount to the equation we would often make. Well, you don\u2019t have love in your life, that you were surrounded by love, that you were held by love and that you\u2019d had too small an imagination about that word, that thing. Well, I think this whole capitalist structure often forms our notion of love as if it were something you acquired, do you know, or you got. Yeah. And we\u2019re also just so inundated with\u2026 Totally. The love story. The love story is between two people. Romantic people, absolutely. I think our notion of love is so based on a kind of, I don\u2019t know, it just seems a very unevolved and very unenlightened notion. Yes. You know, that it\u2019s this one person who you will meet. The One. The One. And, by the way, I\u2019ve yet to meet anybody. Yes, there are people who have good marriages that have lasted long, but I don\u2019t think you will talk to anybody who will tell you this is the panacea, and this is the only person who I\u2019ve ever loved that fulfilled them. Of course not. And I think I just feel so excited now in my life because, now that my notion of love, that has been dispelled, that old notion. And even though you think you\u2019ve dispelled it, it still haunts you and lingers, you know. How do we get rid of so much of that stuff? It\u2019s like in your cells. You just gotta keep purging. But now I feel there is not a day that has passed since I recovered from cancer where I feel so joyful to be sitting here occupying this space with you, to be in \u2014 this summer, I had my friends and we were in Italy and we were dancing and we were swimming and we were talking and we were having amazing evenings. And every moment of that was so dear to me and precious and I think we find our fulfillment where we choose to find our fulfillment. And if you\u2019re told you can only find it here and you don\u2019t look at where it is, which is your life, you keep thinking it\u2019s coming. Right, right. You know? Oh, it\u2019ll be here one day. I\u2019ll get the big love. Well, you have the big love. It\u2019s already here. Yeah. You talked about the daily, subtle simple gathering of kindnesses. I mean, it was that love you felt. It was also the love you felt from those women in the Congo who were praying for you. Absolutely. Well, I think it was one of those things where I had one of those bad nights where I was thinking about all my past lovers and husbands and the failure of love in my life. With a capital \u201CL.\u201D I just didn\u2019t get it in my own intimacy issues and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I suddenly realized, okay, how many beautiful people had shown up for me who were cooking me eggs? Marie Cecil who was cooking me eggs at five in the morning to settle my stomach when I was in chemo or my granddaughter who packed my bags when I went to see my mother for the last time or, you know, my sister who was there every minute on the couch with me putting washcloths on my forehead. And it was just this moment of like, \u2018Oh, my God, my life is so rich.\u2019 And I think, again, it\u2019s like there are the trees, there is the love. Everything\u2019s \u2014 the paradise is here. Paradise is right in front of us. We are so \u2014 I think I\u2019m gonna go back to capitalism because I think what is engineered is longing. It is engineered longing and desire in us for what can be in the future, you know. And so because it\u2019s always about the next product, the next big thing. You\u2019re right, right. You look at clothes and you always see some hot, sexy, fabulous couple wearing those jeans and you\u2019re like, oh, the jeans, i.e., the love. Like everything\u2019s all hooked in to the seduction, do you know? And often, when you wake up and you\u2019re in a shaggy state with your lover, you don\u2019t actually look like that, but it\u2019s delicious in it\u2019s own messy, human way. And I think we\u2019re always comparing the messy, human to that, so whatever this is doesn\u2019t come up right. And to celebrity culture. Come on. The celebrity culture of the couples and the beauty as if\u2026 Brad and Angelina. Exactly , exactly. We know exactly what that is and that is not accidental. What if we actually were content with our lives? What if we actually knew this was paradise, you know? It would be very hard to control us. While you had your cancer, your mother also had struggled with cancer and then she had a recurrence, right? And she died? I feel like you said some very stunning things about family. I mean, you learned like your sister, your relationship with your sister, was so repaired through that experience of being sick. But you talk about how you kind of compared the effect of cancer on your body to the effect of like your father\u2019s abuse, that when there\u2019s that kind of disorder, that it creates mutations just like cells mutate in your body that creates mutations in relationships. I thought that was really interesting. I wonder if you were also really able to be there with your mother when she was dying even though that had been a really hard relationship and to let go of your resentments from all those years. I wonder if you feel like you would have been able to be present to her in that way if you hadn\u2019t gone through that experience of cancer and all the things, all the learning that you\u2019re describing that came with that. I\u2019m not sure. You know, I think I had done a lot. I had gotten closer. I was at a neutral place with my mother. I wasn\u2019t feeling bitter or hateful to her anymore, but I\u2019m not sure I was feeling all that much love either. I just was neutral. I would go to see her. I would be kind to her. I think cancer made me so open and porous and vulnerable that I was able to really be with her. And I wasn\u2019t just feeling love with her in those last moments. I had a lot of feelings. I know you were honest with her. Yeah. But you were honest in a way that in fact was very loving, right? In a really grown-up way? It felt that way, it felt that way. And I felt when I left my mother that night, I felt like, okay, okay, this is done. This is done and we\u2019re okay, we\u2019re okay. That\u2019s one level of that. But I think when \u2014 somebody said to me last night who had read the book, when you don\u2019t get love by your mother, it\u2019s a really hard road. I don\u2019t know that that ever goes away. You know what I mean? I think, look, I do not feel a victim to it. I don\u2019t feel it, but I watch people with their babies sometimes. And I watch women who have had a relationship with their mothers where they felt connected, where they felt connected to her body, where they felt connected to her being. And that is an absence I will live with forever. It is not to say that the spirit doesn\u2019t fill it up or dance doesn\u2019t fill it up. I know, I know. But it\u2019s just what is. I think you get older and you come to terms with what you\u2019ve been given. This is your story, this is what your thing is. This is \u2014 you make do, you know. And you make beauty out of it and you make art out of it and you make life out of it. I remember once a friend of mine told me that he was interviewing a man who was 99, a great artist, and he was dying and had just a huge level of a body of work and a huge achievement. And all he could talk about as he was dying was the fact that he never had a father. And it really struck me that, at the core, core, core, core, that that relationship is like the fundamental beginning of any growth, any tree. You know, how the tree will grow will be dependent on that. And we become interesting trees as a result of it. Some of us grow that direction. But it\u2019s still there at the core. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with playwright Eve Ensler, on discovering her life through cancer, as described in her memoir, In the Body of the World. I mentioned I was at this event recently with the poets from Sierra Leone in northern Uganda and, you know, in places like that, in moments like that, poetry and beauty take on this power and this centrality. I don\u2019t know. I wonder if part of this \u2014 if we are evolving as a species, which I agree with you and I think about that a lot and I think I picked that up in my conversations. But if somehow there\u2019s something in there about us not needing to be in such a crisis to find that power in ourselves and sustain it without that kind of crisis, right? Absolutely. The thing is, we are in crisis in every respect. You mean, all the time anyway? Well, we\u2019re in crisis. The earth is in crisis, you know. Humans are in crisis. We\u2019re talking about a huge percentage of people who are living in dire poverty on the planet. So it would be great to think of us not being in crisis, but in fact we are. But I would love to believe that, when we evolve to the next place, we\u2019re not going to have to utilize crisis as the basis for transformation, but that love might be the basis or connection might be the basis. And I think, by the way, I don\u2019t feel now that I need things to be terrible in order to change. Like that is not my modus operandi anymore. No, no. You know? Yeah. I feel this in you, that you can sustain this cathar \u2014 like those things that came to you in catharsis are now normalized. They\u2019re part of how you move through the world. Well, what I long for now is transformation. I think having gone through the cancer experience like I get that there is nothing static, so what I want \u2014 all I want to do is go back to school. I want to learn more. I want to grow more. And honestly, I don\u2019t want it to be based on drama, do you know? Like and crisis and horror. I don\u2019t know what motivates people. I fear sometimes that that crisis thing is the driving point. You look at it like a deadline, for example, right? Yeah, and you\u2019re right. Of course you\u2019re right that we are in all kinds of crisis as we speak, as we sit here. But there\u2019s crisis that you can ignore at least for a long time. There\u2019s crisis that we are ignoring collectively and then there are the times you get thrown into the hospital and cut open. Yeah, exactly. When you get, oh, my God, I\u2019m in crisis and we\u2019re in crisis. Like the whole crisis world, the pit of crisis opens up, you know . But I guess the thing would be, I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s about softening and by a feeling held by each other so that we could be open to that pain. I think so. I absolutely think so. And I think play is a part of it and being with each other in gentle ways and being with each other in careful ways, you know. I think so often in the same way that we don\u2019t see trees, we don\u2019t see each other. We don\u2019t see how traumatized people are, tender people are. I think sometimes if one were fully awake, one would do nothing in one\u2019s day except for stop on the road, on the people you meet, because you would see their pain. Do you know? We walk past everyone. Sometimes it just crushes my heart. But you\u2019d have to be able to bear that pain too, right? It\u2019s because, if we don\u2019t stop because we couldn\u2019t bear it. Right. But you would also understand that it\u2019s part of you already, so that when you stop to actually acknowledge it, you\u2019re actually allowing it to move as opposed to be frozen in you, you know. You know, I was thinking while I was reading you. I\u2019m always a little bit concerned about the language we use, especially about cancer, because, you know, in our lifetime, cancer has gone from being a death sentence to a chronic disease that people survive. But the language is so combative, right? It\u2019s fighting cancer, it\u2019s beating cancer. And I felt like \u2014 I mean, you definitely fought, but it was kind of like a hybrid\u2026 I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re saying this. Right? I mean, so it was both things. I don\u2019t feel like I fought cancer. No, and I don\u2019t\u2026 I feel like I\u2026 You wrestled with it, right? I wrestled \u2014 I feel like I was in the churning of cancer. I feel like cancer took me and went, okay. Yeah, and you met it head-on, right? You\u2026 Some days. Some days I wasn\u2019t feeling like I wanted to go there. Sometimes I \u2014 you know, some days I was brave, some days I stayed under the covers. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something you can fight, do you know? Then I wonder if we hurt ourselves with those kinds of metaphors about illness and just these moments where life is not what we thought it would be. When people would talk to me about, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna beat this,\u201D or, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna slay cancer,\u201D or, \u201CYou\u2019re gonna\u201D \u2014 I would say what I\u2019m gonna do hopefully is become more of who I was meant to be. And cancer has given me this huge, dramatic, turbulent opportunity to do that. I did not know at the end of this if I \u2014 and I still don\u2019t know. I\u2019m three and a half years cancer-free. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. I feel fantastic that I\u2019ve gotten this time. And I feel very well. And I feel unbelievably lucky to be alive. But I get that cancer afforded me this very extreme opportunity to both release things that needed to go, confront things that needed to be, and to really \u2014 you know, I think when things get very, very, very, very extreme, you have an opportunity to go into the deepest parts of yourself, do you know, and really explore\u2026 Whether you want to or not. Whether you want to or not. You can resist that, but the door is open. You can go there. So, you know, one of the things I\u2019ve been talking a lot about is chemo as a transformative experience. Yes, right. That\u2019s where I feel like \u2014 I mean, there was some language of purging and battle. What was it you purging the badness that was projected on you, but never yours, right? That was somebody advising you about how to think about the chemo. Exactly. If it becomes something where you\u2019re gonna slay the cancer, it\u2019s oddly then about you and your success or failure. I don\u2019t know how to slay cancer, don\u2019t have an idea how to do that. I wouldn\u2019t know how to do that. What I do know how to do and can try to do is begin to ride that wave that is pulsing through me and see if I can go where it\u2019s trying to take me. Do you know? And when the walls come up and I\u2019m resisting it to say, okay, who\u2019s gonna help me? How do I get help to get to the next place where I need to go in my consciousness? That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna live, you know, but I know if I had died, if I die today, I will be much happier than if I had died five years ago. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about it. I\u2019ll die okay today. It\u2019s okay. I would not have felt that had I died five years ago. There was just so much stuff I hadn\u2019t gotten to and gotten clean, gotten rid of. You use a lot of language and imagery of like ritual around chemotherapy. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I\u2019m big on ritual. Yeah, yeah. But I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever heard anybody talk about chemo that way. I think, once Sue, you know, my ex-therapist and incredible friend, gave me this framework to say that \u2014 God, I was terrified of chemo. But when she said to me, \u201CThe chemo\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for the cancer. It\u2019s for all the rape, all the perpetrators and you\u2019re gonna poison them and they\u2019re never coming back.\u201D And I went, \u201CI wanna go to chemo.\u201D I couldn\u2019t wait to go to chemo. It was like, okay, every time they pump this poison into my body, it will be the medicine. Because I always believed in that idea of turning poison into medicine. I always loved that phrase, you know, like how do we turn poison into medicine? How do we turn? You know, it\u2019s very much a part of my Buddhist practice, you know, and had been for years. So the idea that I was having literal poison being pumped into me that could become medicine, it really became a ritual and I would literally go and I would sit as it came into me and I would visualize what I wanted to burn away and what I wanted to dissolve and what I wanted to \u2014 and it worked. It really did work. I mean, that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have my own mission cause and I have my dark hours. Of course we do. We\u2019re human beings. But am I fraught? Is my daily existence fraught the way it used to be? Not at all, not at all. I\u2019m happy now. I have a great happiness now in my life and I didn\u2019t before. I was always battling. This notion of being \u201Cpeople of the second wind\u201D is kind of how you end the book, which really is what you\u2019re just pointing at. Talk about what that means to you. I love the idea of the second wind. I\u2019ve always loved it like that you\u2019re running and running and running and suddenly you get that next wind and you can keep going. And I\u2019ve always been very curious what lives in that space of second wind. Like, what\u2019s in there? Like, what part of us spiritually, physically? What is it, you know, what are the ingredients of it? And what it feels like in the second wind and \u2014 if you think about the second wind, you don\u2019t do a lot of thinking about it. You know, the second wind comes upon you. You know, you can\u2019t even think up a second wind, right? Again, just to go back to where we started, it\u2019s a full body experience. It\u2019s not so much a cerebral experience. It\u2019s a total body, and I feel to some degree that we\u2019re kind of in our second wind as humanity or could be. This could be our second wind, but it requires a radical re-conjuring and re-conceiving of the story. Like, what\u2019s the story? What are we doing here? And I absolutely believe it\u2019s possible, but enough people have to believe it\u2019s possible and be willing to kind of move with this wind that is trying to come in, trying to pass through us right now.
