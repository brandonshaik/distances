  "fullText": "This is Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CScience and Being.\u201D There\u2019s a wonderful passage in one of Einstein\u2019s essays where he asks the question `What is it,\u2019 you think he says, `that motivates the scientist to work the long hours of the night trying to find the answer to the complex puzzles of life, you know, when most people have long ago given up?\u2019 And \u2014 and of course, that\u2019s a profoundly spiritual question. Many of history\u2019s greatest scientists considered their work to be a religious endeavor, a direct search for God. Pioneers like Newton, Copernicus, even Galileo believed that their discoveries told humanity more about God\u2019s nature than had been known before. But beginning in the early 18th century, science and religion came to be at odds. The gap widened most famously with the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species. I believe that \u2014 because of my Jewish background that diseases are all curable. It \u2014 it may not \u2014 you know, from a scientific point of view, it may be that there are some diseases we can cure and others not. But I \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t believe that God gave us a challenge that we are not able to meet if we gather up all our resources and all our strengths and focus on \u2014 on what has to be done. Many of history\u2019s greatest scientists considered their work to be a religious endeavor, a direct search for God. Pioneers like Newton, Copernicus, even Galileo believed that their discoveries told humanity more about God\u2019s nature than had been known before. But beginning in the early 18th century, science and religion came to be at odds. The gap widened most famously with the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species. In recent years, though, a new dialogue has begun driven by leading scientists across the world. Today on Speaking of Faith, we\u2019ll explore this new terrain by touching down in three disciplines: biology, artificial intelligence and genetics. We\u2019ll speak with three scientists, each of whom is working in a field that\u2019s rapidly advancing our understanding of what it means to be human. From very different perspectives, they suggest that our most sophisticated 21st-century discoveries may be driving us back to questions of faith. What\u2019s interesting to me is in the last 20 years, there\u2019s been a serious intellectual, kind of, academic reopening of the dialogue between science and religion to explore a lot of the traditional areas where \u2014 where \u2014 where science and religion have seemed to become in conflict. Dr. Carl Feit is an Orthodox Jew and an immunologist at Yeshiva University in Manhattan. I personally feel that a lot of the traditional science-religion issues really have to be readdressed in light of modern science. Carl Feit wrestles with the great questions of science and religion as he works on the frontiers of cancer research, and as he studies the Talmud. The Talmud is the ancient repository of Jewish oral tradition which was composed over a period of roughly 1,000 years. It\u2019s a vast free-flowing reflection wandering over Jewish law and the entire course of human knowledge. One of the wonderful things about Talmud is that even when you study it your whole life, you keep discovering it. In that way, it\u2019s comparable to other great works of literature, and for the 1,500 years since the compiling of the Talmud, rabbinic thought has continued to analyze it. So the excitement of it is that it\u2019s an ongoing dialogue that cuts across the generations. How does that bounce off of your work as a scientist, as a researcher working with the very earthy reality of the human body and, in fact, disease in the human body? I come from a tradition in Judaism which looks at the story of Genesis in the beginning of the Bible and understands that God is the creator of the world and of the universe, but that he created it in an incomplete state. It\u2019s not in its perfected state precisely because there are still diseases to be cured and bridges to be built and people to be fed. So my passion for working on cancer has always fit in with my religious, theological beliefs that this is precisely what human beings are supposed to be doing. I heard a public health official the other day refer to cancer as a naturally occurring form of bioterrorism. But I wonder if there isn\u2019t some kind of paradox in you as a person of faith working with the human body \u2014 is there a sense in which you also have to admire the intricacy of this part of the creation at the same time that you are endeavoring to eradicate it? Does that make sense? Yes, it does. It does. One of the fascinating things about cancer is that it is the human body turned against itself, not just in the sense of other degenerative diseases where the body stops functioning, but that cancer cell is your cell which is growing now at the expense of you. I like to say the cancer cell goes into business for itself. So from the point of view of biology, every cell is \u2014 is measured \u2014 its biological success is measured by its ability to reproduce itself successfully. Cancer cells do that. They reproduce themselves all the time, better at \u2014 you know, at a certain point, better than the rest of the cells of your body. Right. So from a certain point of view, from a biological point of view, you can say, well, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re really successful. That\u2019s an intriguing scientific aspect of doing cancer research. It leads me to think a number of things, and that is the two-edged nature of the material world and of the universe that we live in. The physical universe doesn\u2019t come beset with values. It\u2019s kind of neutral in the sense that, A, it can be used for good and it can be used for bad. You referred earlier to a kind of bioterrorism and things like that, and that \u2014 that is certainly true. But it \u2014 it\u2019s also morally neutral. I don\u2019t find a moral or ethic that is in any way easily discernable from the study of science. There\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s general phi \u2014 you know, moral \u2014 moral philosophy; moral ethics provide somewhat of a framework. But I have found that the richest source of moral insight comes from religious tradition. You know, that\u2019s very interesting, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t think I have a complete thought here, but to think about the vastness of nature and religious tradition as something which provides the \u2014 the proper context or an illuminating context to make sense of that \u2014 is that\u2026 Yes. Yes. From the scientific perspective, everything that we can discover we should discover. The problem comes up: What do you do with something once you\u2019ve discovered it? So that was the moral dilemma that was faced by the scientists after World War II or, for some of them before, World War II when they realized that they were working on exploring and exploiting the potential energy that\u2019s present in an atom, that that\u2019s a two-edged sword u \u2014 that could be used to destroy humanity. But it also can be used to cure cancer. We use radionuclides in our treatment of cancer. So from the scientific point of view, you\u2019ve made a discovery. What\u2019s going to happen with that discovery, and how will it be used with human beings? And you\u2019re saying that\u2026 And again, I\u2026 \u2026that religious tradition is the only place, the only repository of \u2014 of appropriately\u2026 Yeah. \u2026complex answers to those questions? In my experience, yes. Uh-huh. What \u2014 one of the wonderful things about Talmudic scholarship is because it was always so open-ended and broad-ranging that it is virtually impossible not to find some precedent for whatever new technological problem arises. The underlying discussion was probably had, you know, hundreds if not thousands of years ago, and so you have a framework for looking at what looks like a new problem. Even something like cancer research or cloning. Even something like cancer research and cloning. I wonder if you can describe for me some particular moments in your career as a researcher and a scientist when you came across \u2014 you know, when you made concrete discoveries which illuminated your understanding of the nature of God. One of the things that you can\u2019t help noticing as a scientist is that the world is \u2014 is almost infinitely complex and intriguing, so it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s like a giant \u2014 a giant jigsaw puzzle or a giant \u2014 a giant intellectual game that \u2014 that scientists can play. We just keep delving deeper and deeper and we find these new layers of \u2014 of meaning and logic and significance. But nature doesn\u2019t give her \u2014 give away her secrets easily, and I think that was \u2014 I think that\u2019s a paraphrase of \u2014 of Einstein, that it\u2019s not all there for the having. You have to search it out, you have to dig it out. It requires a great deal of effort in order to find it. The theological take that I have on that is that God, in his wisdom, does not immediately reveal himself in the world, and so my science, again, does affect my theology because I \u2014 I \u2014 I go to Jewish tradition and, of course, in Jewish tradition I find basis for \u2014 for that. Jewish tradition talks about the hidden face of God. And so rather than driving me to question God\u2019s existence, I understand that if I want to understand the hidden face of God I have to delve into it. I have to work a little bit harder, just like one doesn\u2019t see the atoms and the molecules floating around when you look at the top of the table. I think just on the surface there might seem a paradox. Someone might say that \u2014 that precisely the problem you work with of cancer is \u2014 is an aspect of creation which \u2014 which might seem to be a sign of the absence of God or \u2014 or the recklessness of God. That\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 I understand that that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the part of nature that God left for us to finish up\u2026 Yeah. You\u2019re right. \u2026to find the cures. I did hear something when you talked about your discovery of \u2014 in your work of nature as there\u2019s an element of it being a great, a vast intellectual game. And when you used those words, I \u2014 I really saw this compatibility between the intellectual, traditional Judaism, in which you have lived all your life, and \u2014 and this endeavor, which is secular, I supposed, in a strict sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like to call it general rather than secular\u2026 OK. \u2026because \u2014 because secular kind of implies that it\u2019s not religious. It\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s religious and there\u2019s secular. I like to talk about my \u2014 my Torah studies and my general studies, but I don\u2019t really believe that there\u2019s anything that I do that is \u2014 that is secular, that is, you know, not \u2014 not within the \u2014 the framework of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of God and theology. Carl Feit is a professor of biology at Yeshiva University in New York. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. Today, \u201CScience and Being. \u201CNext, the brave new world of artificial intelligence. Lieutenant Commander Data (Played by Brent Spiner): As Doctor, what is the definition of life? That is a big question. Why do you ask? I\u2019m searching for a definition that will allow me to test an hypothesis. Well, the broadest scientific definition might be that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food, derive energy from it, grow, adapt themselves to their surroundings and reproduce. And you suggest that anything that exhibits these characteristics is considered alive. In general, yes. What about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. Yet I am considered to be alive. That\u2019s true. But you are unique. Huh. I wonder if that it so. Data, if I may ask, what exactly are you getting at? I\u2019m curious as to what transpired between the moment when I was nothing more than an assemblage of parts in Dr. Soong\u2019s laboratory and the next moment when I became alive. What is it that endowed me with life? \u201CStar Trek\u201D\u2018s Commander Data is a machine, but his question is a human one and it begs both scientific and theological reflection. What makes us, any of us, more than an assemblage of bodily parts? What gives us life? What gives us humanity? There is a computer scientist and theologian who gives a speech entitled Commander Data goes to Divinity School. For four years, German-born scientist Anna Foerst was the theological adviser in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where a new generation of embodied robots is being created. These machines do not learn like traditional computers by having knowledge programmed in. They learn the way human babies learn, through physical interaction with their environment and especially through relationship with human beings. They have partial bodies which are programmed to make them capable of touch, sensation and emotional response. Their names are Cog and Kismet. Anna Foerst. Cog and Kismet are two very cute, very interactive, very emotional and humanoid robots, and Kismet is even more interesting than Cog because Kismet has the same amount or similar amount of processors and all that, but it\u2019s all concentrated on facial expressions: big blue eyes, long eyelashes, furry brows. When Kismet looks sad you want to kind of, you know, make it happy again; when it\u2019s happy you smile \u2014 isn\u2019t that \u2014 you \u2014 you basically react with it like you do with a baby. I mean, it\u2019s astonishing. And of course, that raises all sorts of theological issues. Anna Foerst is currently authoring a book entitled \u201COn Robots and Humans \u2026and God.\u201D As she worked with Cog and Kismet, she made discoveries which shed light on creation, on her understanding of her own Christian faith and on the core of what it means to be human. And she insists that as computer scientists seek to build more and more intelligent machines, they\u2019re driven to ask theological questions. There are these most brilliant engineers and computer scientists at MIT, the cradle of artificial intelligence, and they\u2019re all brilliant people there trying to build something remotely like a human baby. And the difference is still so huge. And it makes you very modest. You know, it makes you admiring the human system. Initially when I heard about this, I wasn\u2019t quite sure that I could see how you could make much theology out of this, and then as I started getting into it, all of these basic theological questions and subjects just jumped off the computer screen. And so I wondered if I could just name some of those questions and ask you how your theology has evolved through what you\u2019ve experienced working with Cog and Kismet\u2026 Oh, interesting, yes. \u2026on these subjects. Let\u2019s do it. OK. And the first one is, as I\u2019m looking at the pictures on the Cog website of Cog in creation, there\u2019s the head \u2014 the old Cog head and then here \u2014 here\u2019s the one that really stuck with me: the first arm. And it\u2019s so richly evocative and I thought, `All right, this is creation; this is Genesis.\u2019 And so I wonder if you\u2019d say a little bit about how you interpret the Genesis story, the matter of creation and live with it as a piece of your theology, knowing what you know how through working with these robots. When I came to this whole field, I basically interpreted the desire to build humanlike intelligent machines as hubris, as arrogance, as trying to be like God, so \u2014 so \u2014 so that was kind of the beginning point. And I think it\u2019s important to point that out because, indeed, my whole theology and my whole understanding of what it means to be human and my whole spirituality have been radically changed. And I cannot really chronologically say that, so I just give you bits and pieces of discoveries. Fine. The first thing was, indeed, this discovery of how much fun that people have in doing this thing. So there is this whole joy. There\u2019s just something in engineering that probably everyone who builds anything can share if you really built something and it works, it works the way you envision it. It\u2019s a feeling of satisfaction which is so amazing. `And God saw what he had made and it was very good.\u2019 Ah, yeah. And it was very good. Exactly. So it doesn\u2019t mean playing God. No, you could actually interpret it quite the other way. When God created us he gave us his own creativity. God created us in God\u2019s image. And that leads us directly to a Jewish concept of Golan building. The mystics of the 14th, 15th, 16th century in East Europe \u2014 they had the idea of building artificial humans from clay, and the act of building an artificial human was an act of prayer because the more creative you are, the more you celebrate your God-given creativity and therefore the more you celebrate God. And then again, that leads us right back to the sense of awe you have when you try to build a humanoid because it\u2019s so difficult. Incarnation. Yeah. How do you think differently about incarnation as a Christian computer scientist, mother of Cog and Kismet? Before I went into this endeavor, I really had trouble with the figure of Jesus Christ; I really had. All the power I could give Jesus really was as a \u2014 as a moral ideal, right? And the more I learned about embodiment and social interaction I realized what actually happens in the incarnation is that God becomes a body with pain, with digestion, joy, with all that sort of stuff, and with that body, God becomes a part of a real community, experience friendship, trust, love, betrayal. So I think this is kind of an interesting development. By the study of robots\u2026 Yeah. \u2026suddenly the figure of Jesus Christ for me as true man and true God became absolutely crucial. OK. Free will. What does your work with robots, with humanoid robots, teach you about free well as a theologian? If you believe you have free will and if the people who are around you treat you as if you have free will, you have free will. You know, you can talk about, well, in robots, everything is machinelike and programmed, and otherwise you could argue, well, wait a moment. If the robot does things which come out of its whole interaction with the environment, which is so complex \u2014 Right? \u2014 when the robot does unforeseeable things and actions which we cannot explain at all, the robot learns, you know, that the programming changes. We only program the simple part; the whole interaction is learned, right? All those kind of things \u2014 you cannot talk about the robots as being deterministic anymore. So they have free will if we give them the chance to employ free will, like we do with a baby. Our culture often fears humanlike, scientific creations. After all, Frankenstein became a monster and destroyed his creator. Many of the ethnical dilemmas raised by 21st-century technologies revolve around how we define life. Before Anna Foerst spent four years at MIT with the robots Cog and Kismet, she trained as a theologian, study that included work as a hospital counselor. And she says that experience has been especially important as she reflects on the spiritual challenges raised by her other field of robotics. I learned from these experiences \u2014 from the experience of sickness to question this whole question `What is normal?,\u2019 which ultimately leads to the question `What does it mean to be human?\u2019 Does personhood stop when the person is in a coma? Does personhood stop when the person lose all her memories? That experience makes you much more aware of how much you can broaden the sense of personhood. So then what would be the criterion to call a robot a person? Well, actually, we cannot say. If enough people would say \u2014 and especially the engineers who built that machine \u2014 `We cannot switch it off anymore. Sorry. There is something happening and it\u2019s something beyond what we know, even though we built that thing. We know every single screw and every single processor. Something has happened\u2019 \u2014 that would be for me a threshold. And is \u2014 is that question or would one definition of that question be, `We haven\u2019t built a soul into this machine and yet perhaps the soul arises from the body and from these relationships\u2019? I think the body \u2014 I mean, again, take the Hebrew term nephesh for soul, which is not the Greek term of soul as something away from the body, but nephesh is a kind of emergent property, something which emerges in interaction between people and between people and God. So soul is not something which is in one individual person. Soul is everywhere there where community is alive. I mean, it\u2019s also, of course, part of being German. We live with the memory how persons, neighbors, friends, relatives basically within a very short period ceased to be persons. Everyone knew that they were still humans, but the personhood was gone. They were not perceived as persons with dignity anymore. You know, there are people who argue that a fully functional chimp has more value than a retarded child. There are people who say people who don\u2019t have a white skin color are less \u2014 have less value. You know, and so you have all these exclusions of humans from the human community because of their skin color, religion, race, gender \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know what. And you can fight all these arguments because you can say, `I don\u2019t buy your assumption in evaluating humans. Sorry.\u2019 So what is left? Left is the assignment of personhood which came to us by God and which we can give to others. So why not include chimps, why not include robots? Alongside Frankenstein and the wonderful Commander Data of \u201CStar Trek,\u201D there\u2019s also Hal \u2014 Right? \u2014 from\u2026 Yeah. \u2026\u201D2001,\u201D who goes crazy, and maybe that\u2019s the fear. This computer which becomes sentient and pathological and dangerous\u2026 But see, Hal is not embodied. Hal is a computer; it\u2019s not a robot. OK. Hal does not become in \u2014 I mean, I think something like Hal is impossible because I don\u2019t\u2026 Because he\u2019s not embodied. Because he\u2019s not embodied and because it\u2019s not interactive. I mean, it can speak, but ultimately it\u2019s on its own. So even to be \u2014 as though \u2014 you know, what \u2014 what occurred to me there i \u2014 there is, well, why shouldn\u2019t they be allowed to go crazy? Because we do. I mean\u2026 Yeah. No, no, no, no. They\u2019re allowed to be crazy but the thing is \u2014 the thing is, you know, this whole destruction motif is something which is very unlikely to occur when you raise them as partners. Another revelation for me was the revisiting of the Frankenstein story. The monster doesn\u2019t get a name. It knew that it was smart, but no one ever treated it as such. It was rejected from the community, and then, of course, no wonder that you get Bruiser. So basically the whole monster story tells us about the importance of community. Even with our technology. Even with our technology, to keep them as partners and respect them. So Kismet can only been seen in relationship to humans. It will change our own self-understanding; it will change the way we interact with one another and with machines. It will change community. Anna Foerst is visiting professor for theology and computer science at St. Bonaventure University and director of the national God and Computers project. The scientist who invited Anna Foerst to MIT is Rod Brooks, the Australian-born director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and creator of the robot Cog. In 1996, he was the subject of a documentary film on eccentric geniuses. Here is a short clip. Rod Brooks of MIT. You can link to pictures of Cog and Kismet through our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. So far this hour, we\u2019ve heard from Anna Foerst, who worked under Brooks, and Carl Feit, a leading cancer researcher in New York, each of them working on the frontiers of their field and yet confronting age-old questions of meaning. After a short break, we\u2019ll return with geneticist and priest Lindon Eaves, who conducts groundbreaking studies of twins. What do science and religious mysticism have in common? I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Each week we ask how religion shapes events in the news and in everyday life. Today, a cancer researcher, a computer scientist, and next, a geneticist. They\u2019re all working on the frontiers of science, and confronting religious questions of meaning. What we currently choose to study about the human is a pretty pathetic subset of what it is to be human. That\u2019s Lindon Eaves, who is a professor in both human genetics and psychiatry at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine. You can choose to define your anthropology in terms of what, for example, psychologists think we can measure, or we can choose to define anthropology in terms of all the things that people write novels about and write poems about and write music for. How do you get from something as simple as a DNA and as \u2014 maybe as complex as the world outside and other people to what we understand quintessentially as the person? And I think that\u2019s where the real challenge and real fascination comes. In his day job, Lindon Eaves is the principal investigator on some of the nation\u2019s largest ongoing studies of twins. On the weekends, he preaches at an Episcopal church. Religion, like science, he says, is about passionately pursuing what we know we cannot pin down. And he compares scientific formulas to religious creeds, doctrines formulated by great theological minds to clarify basic beliefs. Lindon Eaves cautions that even the best answers of science and religion can become idols blocking our view of the complexity of what it means to be human. When I spoke with him, I experienced the ongoing conversation he says he conducts all the time with himself, a lively and irreverent back-and-forth between the scientist in him and the priest. I would say there are plenty of times when I just need to keep religion at bay in order to do my job properly. You know, I mean, to be a thorough-going scientist I am compelled in the short term to see really good reasons for not believing the current model for reality \u2019cause that\u2019s how science proceeds. You know, it\u2019s a conversation between the past and the future with a real belief that everything we\u2019ve believed in the past may turn out to be wrong. Which is really the opposite of a biblical worldview, isn\u2019t it? Well, yeah; certainly, if you take the \u2014 sort of the conventional kind of religious approach, yes. It \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it feels very different. But then I say if you really look at human experience, the truth is that we\u2019re all living a life of experiment, and I mean in every aspect of our lives. I mean, you know, the \u2014 so you can \u2014 you can either think of let\u2019s say the creeds of the great traditions, as it were, as telling you what you ought to think, or you can say they are in some sense comparable to theories of science. They are the best distillations of where we\u2019ve been. But we don\u2019t approach reality treating those models as if they\u2019re the last word. We treat them as operational hypotheses. Yeah, I like to think of the creeds as the outlines of arguments that have been passed down to us, but \u2014 but somehow because people are so underinformed about what the arguments were\u2026 Yeah. I\u2019ll tell you, the thing that doesn\u2019t feature much in a lot of theological discourse, of \u2014 of course, is the \u2014 the role of mysticism. Now I was going to be careful about that because when you use the word `mystic\u2019 it has all sorts of weird connotations as well. But there\u2019s a wonderful passage in one of Einstein\u2019s essays where he asks the question `What is it,\u2019 you think he says, `that motivates the scientist to work the long hours of the night trying to find the answer to the complex puzzles of life, you know, when most people have long ago given up?\u2019 And \u2014 and of course, that\u2019s a profoundly \u2014 profoundly spiritual question. And I\u2019ll tell you, there is nobody who comes close to articulating the ultimately uncertain nature of our experience as John of the Cross. You know, I mean, when he talks about setting out on the dark night with only the \u2014 the fire of longing in his heart kind of thing, that\u2019s something that is very close to the spirituality of the scientist. From the mystical poem \u201CThe Dark Night of the Soul\u201D by the 16th-century Spanish Carmelite monk St. John of the Cross: `One dark night fired with love\u2019s urgent longings \u2014 oh, the sheer grace \u2014 I went out unseen, my house being now all stilled, on that glad night in secret \u2014 for no one saw me, nor did I look at anything, with no other light or guide than the one that burned in my heart.\u2019 I\u2019m seeing this comparison between the scientific worldview and the mystical, religious worldview, which is \u2014 which is a search for ultimate reality and ultimate truth, and in that search there\u2019s this constant discernment again and again that\u2026 Right. \u2026that we have everything yet to discover. DR. EAVES: Yeah, when it comes down to it, if you think pastorally, the places where religion is able to connect very often are not around the issues of what you claim as certainty but how you deal with darkness and uncertainty. And the classical statement of this, of course, is Job. Yeah. You know, I mean, in a sense, you ask yourself: When all is said and done, what does Job find? Well, he finds that all the conventional answers are a complete waste of time; they don\u2019t do justice to the truth of his experience. So point one is, you know, the comforters are a dead loss. And especially his ideas about God. Yeah, right. And so what does God say? We all know what God says. He says, `Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?\u2019 Well, everybody goes, `Ooh, ahh, and isn\u2019t that beautiful.\u2019 But actually it\u2019s more \u2014 it\u2019s more ruthless than that because actually \u2014 I think it\u2019s very telling that God uses the metaphor of the sea monster. It\u2019s not \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really not\u2026 Leviathan, the\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s right. The monster of the deep, this mighty monster, and \u2014 and it\u2019s not just, `Well, you know, I\u2019m so big because I\u2019m God. I can create this thing. And what chance have you got?\u2019 But it\u2019s really much more, `Job, you probably haven\u2019t got a hope in hell of every conquering the monster, but sure as hell, your humanity consists in wrestling with it and trying to get the better of it.\u2019 You know, and if Job is vindicated at the end of it, I mean, it\u2019s not because he comes up with any real argument. It\u2019s because he\u2019s actually fought the battle with the monster with integrity. From the 38th Chapter of Job. `Then the Lord replied to Job out of the whirlwind and said, \u201CWhere were you when I laid the Earth\u2019s foundation? Speak if you have understanding. Do you know who fixed its dimensions or who measured it with a line? Unto what were its bases sunk? Who closed the sea behind doors when it gushed forth out of the womb? When I clothed it in clouds, swaddled it in dense clouds, when I made breakers my limit for it and set up its bar and doors and said, `You may come so far and no farther. Here your surging waves will stop.\u2019 Have you ever commanded the day to break, assigned the dawn its place so that it seizes the corners of the Earth and shakes the wicked out of it?\u201D\u2018 I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith on Science and Being. You\u2019re listening to a conversation with scientist and Anglican priest Lindon Eaves. As a behavioral geneticist, he provides some of the most incisive intelligence we have about how human personality is influenced by our genetic code. Clearly, there\u2019s a big investment in some people\u2019s minds in genes that are of socioeconomic value. You know, and I\u2019m thinking in terms of genes that influence IQ, genes that influence income, and there have been papers around all of those, and \u2014 and people have sort of, you know, claimed this has got a genetic component, which may be true, and then have, you know, have purported to infer more conservative and sort of \u2014 and let\u2019s say restricting options for humanity on the basis of that. I also would love to find the genes that whenever we listen to something like that make us want to cry, `Bull shit.\u2019 You know, where are the genes that make \u2014 give us the passion for justice, the passion for looking for something beyond the current restriction? Where are the genes that make us transcend those limitations and fight against them? Because I think those are every bit as much a part of our biology as the ones that typically people think of themselves as looking for and a lot of what we go for. You know, I\u2019ve got Psalm 139 in front of me. You know\u2026 `Lord, thou search me out and know me.\u2019 Yeah, but\u2026 `Thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising.\u2019 Yeah. `You created my inmost parts, you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb and my\u2026\u2019 Yeah. `\u2026body was not hidden from you while I was being made in secret and woven in the depth of the Earth.\u2019 A reading from Psalm 139. `For you yourself created my inmost parts. You knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb. I will thank you because I am marvelously made. Your works are wonderful, and I know it well. My body was not hidden from you while I was being made in secret and woven in the depths of the Earth. Your eyes beheld my limbs yet unfinished in the womb. All of them were written in your book.\u2019 I want to ask you what some of the hard questions are for you. You know, if, referring back to Psalm 139, if \u2014 if we believe in a God who knit us together in our mother\u2019s womb, you also observe genetic codes which are flawed, you know, where the \u2014 the knitting seems to have gone awry, which leads to illness and death and sadness and disability and it seems to be built in to a human life. So how do you think about God when you make those kinds of observations as a scientist? How does that comes into your theology? Well, of course, the first thing I think is I don\u2019t need to be a scientist to make those observations. I mean, that \u2014 that experience \u2014 I mean, it may be refined in terms of our understanding of the \u2014 the stuff of which life is, but I don\u2019t know that that puzzle has changed significantly. I mean, heavens, one of the, I think, very important basic insights that, again, is pastorally sig \u2014 significant as well as sort of, you know, philosophically significant is that not-adding-up-ness of life, and that, you know, anything, be it religious or scientific which kind of, you know, pretends that somehow it all does add up is probably lying in the teeth; that life really, you know, doesn\u2019t add up and we\u2019re fumbling our way through trying to make sense of it, and it\u2019s always sort of \u2014 you know, all this stuff about God is \u2014 is \u2014 arises out of that. But where else do you go if you\u2019re trying to have a conversation about the issues that at least some of us find of burning importance? I mean, I really do believe the church is in the reality business in \u2014 in areas that on the whole the rest of culture is not in the reality business. I mean, I don\u2019t think culture\u2019s in the reality business on the business of dying on the whole; it\u2019s in the business of denial. And science can\u2019t talk about that? Well, it sort of can in a bi \u2014 you know, through \u2014 through psychology and stuff. I mean, it\u2019s beginning to understand some of the processes. But I mean, the last time I spent any time with someone who had pancreatic cancer, you know, the issues, you know, are much, much different and much, much more profound and, I think, actually 10 times more important than most of what I do between Monday and Friday trying to figure out whether there\u2019s a gene for depression or not. And I\u2019m also thinking in a positive sense; you talked about earlier about what you want to look for even in genetics is our ability, our capacity to experience beauty and to seek justice. And, you know, I was just reading somewhere that there\u2019s some research now that teaching children wonder and joy can help prevent depression. Oh, that\u2019s interesting. Yeah. Well, yeah, I \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014 I can\u2019t speak to the specific research. Yeah, but I mean, what you\u2019re saying is, which I think is profoundly true, is wow, there\u2019s all sorts of things about humans which don\u2019t typically feature in the way we describe psychopathology, for example, you know, of which \u2014 you don\u2019t often hear people talk about wonder. It\u2019s something that lots of people experience. And, I mean, this is going to sound really soft in the head, and I don\u2019t mean it to, but I mean, I just looked sitting the other day in our back yard eating breakfast and there are the hummingbirds and the \u2014 and the butterflies. And there\u2019s a sort of peace at which I says \u2014 just says, `Our back yard is absolutely just phenomenal in ways that I can\u2019t even begin to articulate in \u2014 in terms of scientific mechanisms and so on.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying that because I\u2019m awed and wondered, I now, you know, don\u2019t need to exercise any intellectual curiosity \u2014 far from it; in fact, very much the reverse. And again, I think `wonder\u2019 is a word which is part of the vocabulary both of science and religious experience. Yes. You\u2019ve got to be a bit careful. I mean, many, many times you get a phone call which says, `Dr. Eaves, come and give a talk at our church, you know, about science and religion,\u2019 and the person on the end of the phone will say something like, `Well, I\u2019m sure you share my view that when I look at a flower I\u2019m so struck with wonder,\u2019 and I\u2019m saying to myself, `Yeah, I\u2019m also struck with a lot of very interesting questions.\u2019 The danger with words like `wonder\u2019 is that they are used in ways that are designed to pre-empt a real conversation about what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s when I get a bit uneasy, you know, when sort of people say, `Well, you know, the foundation of religion is wonder.\u2019 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true, actually. I think the foundation of religion is trying to just make sense of the mess in which we find ourselves living half the time, you know, and it\u2019s also \u2014 the foundation\u2019s also that we\u2019ve evolved to sort of \u2014 to be like this. You know, I mean, I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s a God out there in that sense, but I mean, I think for some reason nature or nature\u2019s god has blessed me with a genetic propensity to find that an interesting question. Lindon Eaves is director of the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavior Genetics. \u201CWorld of Dreams\u201D by musician Peter Mayer. The reflections of these three scientists only scratches the surface of the emerging science-religion dialogue of the present, and yet each of their experiences suggests that in intriguing ways the clash between religious faith and scientific progress may not be so inevitable as it seemed to most of us born in the West in the 20th century. It\u2019s interesting to recall that religion and science were mutually enriching endeavors until just a few centuries ago and to throw that fact into the light of religion\u2019s long sense of time. Future generations may look back on the science-religion divide as a blip in history, a small window of controversy in a larger picture of creative engagement. Indeed, opposite the title page of the book which deepened the rift, Charles Darwin quoted Francis Bacon, who thought of revelation as God\u2019s word and nature as God\u2019s works and of the two together as separate but complementary books of God. Today, there is a thoughtful statement on the website of the National Academy of Sciences which concludes, `Science and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each.\u2019 Yet as early as 1944, the great German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer was studying modern physics and deciding that real theology must be done with all of the knowledge we have at hand in every age. In his \u201CLetters and Papers from Prison,\u201D he wrote, `We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don\u2019t know. That is true of the relationship between God and scientific knowledge, but it is also true of the wider human problems of death, suffering and guilt.\u2019 Lindon Eaves, Carl Feit, and Anna Foerst suggest to me that scientific knowledge can never be separated from human problems like death, suffering and guilt, and that they might most meaningfully be addressed when the two books of nature and revelation, of scientific progress and religious faith, struggle together towards discovery.
