  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, the first in a two-part series on a new generation of Evangelical leadership. We begin with Jim Wallis, a progressive Evangelical activist who is advising presidential candidates and world leaders in what he calls the \u201Cpost-Religious Right era.\u201D There was always a more progressive Evangelical spirit. It was a growing kind of phenomenon. This new generation cares much more about the 30,000 children who died today globally because of totally unnecessary poverty and preventable disease, cares more about those three dozens kids than they do about gay marriage amendments in Ohio. They really do. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Evangelical Christianity has no ultimate hierarchy. But it does have guiding figures in every generation. This week and next, we speak with a few who are changing imaginations within and beyond Evangelical Christianity about the priorities of this faith of over a quarter of the U.S. population. We begin with Jim Wallis, a progressive Evangelical activist who is bringing his vision of religion and politics to a new generation of world leaders. He is determined to put poverty at the top of America\u2019s moral values agenda. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe New Evangelical Leaders.\u201D The association of Evangelical Christianity with conservative politics is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was only in the early 20th century that biblically conservative Christians, who became known as Evangelicals, retreated from a 19th-century tradition of socially and politically engaged faith. The Religious Right of the 1980s marked their reemergence into the public sphere. But there has always been an active strain of Evangelicalism focused on social justice. Jim Wallis has been in the vanguard of this for three decades. And after the 2004 election, many Americans, Evangelicals among them, reacted against what seemed a Republican appropriation of faith and a Democratic neglect of it. Jim Wallis\u2019 book God\u2019s Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn\u2019t Get It dovetailed with this new national discontent. The book became a runaway best seller, and he became a player in mainstream political culture. What is faith? The Democrats reclaim religion as a winning political issue. Joining us now for answers, a charter member of the religious left, the founder of Sojourners/Call to Renewal, the author of God\u2019s Politics. We are honored to have Jim Wallis. Thanks a lot, Jim. Hi, Tucker. I want to put up a quote on the screen. This is from Barack Obama\u2026 These days, Jim Wallis\u2019 council is sought from Capitol Hill to the World Economic Forum at Davos. He co-hosted a first-ever Democratic forum on faith on CNN with Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. So I wanted a deeper sense of who Jim Wallis is and what kind of influence he\u2019s bringing to bear on American Christianity and politics. Once a radical student activist, he is now progressive in his politics, moderately conservative on issues of personal morality, and he quotes his Bible like a revival preacher. Now, 59, Jim Wallis was raised in Detroit by parents who, he says, were Eisenhower Republicans. Oh, I\u2019m from the middle of Middle America. And my mom and dad started the church that was a place I grew up, little Plymouth Brethren assembly, very evangelical place. And it was our whole life, that we had no clergy. So lay leadership was what we had. My dad was an engineer\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026but he was kind of a chief elder. And so I kind of was a pastor\u2019s kid, but he was kind of a real everyday work person. He\u2019d got up every day at 5:00 in the morning to study his Bible for two hours, and then got us up for work and school. And it was that level of commitment and passion, and they both were like that. They were the leaders of the church, though, my mom was a woman, so she couldn\u2019t publicly be the leader, but they were the leaders of the church, you know? And so\u2026 And was it \u2014 Plymouth Brethren, I think\u2026 Yeah. \u2026can be many things. Were they theologically conservative? Did they have a social justice\u2026 Oh, yes. \u2026mindset? No, it was very Evangelical in the usual ways back then. And I remember \u2014 I remember I was 6 years old and my parents were a little nervous, because, well, I wasn\u2019t saved yet. And I was getting up in years, I was 6, you know? So there\u2019s a fiery evangelist that was billed to be coming in a couple of weeks, and so I was kind of dreading the day because I heard he was pretty scary. And all unsaved kids had to sit in the first row. You know \u2014 we never wanted to sit in the first row, because I think the closer you are to a sermon, the more impact it will have in your life, you know? But he preached and he pointed his finger \u2014 it seemed right at me \u2014 and he says, \u2018If Jesus came back tonight, your mommy and daddy would be taken to heaven, and you would be left\u2026 Oh, gosh. \u2026all by yourself.\u2019 Mm-hmm. Well, it got my attention. And so I asked my mother how to fix this thing. And to her everlasting credit, she told me about the love of God, not the wrath of God. And God wanted me to be his child. And so I signed up. It wasn\u2019t deep, but it was, it was as real as it gets, you know, for a 6 year old. Well, my second conversion was really the most important, because I\u2019m 14 now, I\u2019m paying attention in my home city, Detroit. I\u2019m reading the papers, I\u2019m listening to the news, and I\u2019m asking questions: \u2018How come we live the way we do in white Detroit? And life is so different in black Detroit, just a few miles or blocks away?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re too young to ask these questions,\u2019 I was told. \u2018When you get older, you\u2019ll understand or\u2026\u201D So where \u2014 what are we \u2014 what decade are we talking here? This is like early 1960s, yeah. Mm-hmm. And so I didn\u2019t get answers. So I went in the city to find answers, and I met the black church. And they loved the same Jesus and read the same Bible and sang out of the same hymnbook, made it sound so much better than we did. Did you just walk into a black church? Yeah. I just started reading books and I read the autobiography of Malcolm X, and I\u2026 Oh, so the civil rights movement\u2019s bubbling along\u2026 It was\u2026 \u2026in the culture at large. Oh, yeah. And I\u2019m hearing about this guy in the South, this minister named King, you know? What was he up to, you know? How come we never had any black preachers at our church? Never been to a black church. And so I came back with questions and \u2014 new questions and new friends and some answers. And an elder, one night in a very pivotal moment for me, said, \u2018Jim, you have to understand Christianity has nothing to do with racism. That\u2019s political and our faith is personal.\u2019 And, Krista, I think that\u2019s the night that I left in my head and my heart. And I was gone in a couple of years altogether and got \u2014 joined the civil rights struggle and the anti-war movement. I didn\u2019t have words to go around it then, but I do now. And the words are that God is personal, but never private. And I have a privatized notion of faith that never touched the world. So you left the church because you felt that the church\u2026 Yeah. \u2026wasn\u2019t meshed without that and couldn\u2019t get \u2014 couldn\u2019t make the connections you were making? To be honest, I felt kind of kicked out, because I was raising these questions and they really didn\u2019t want them in the church. You know our favorite verse in those days was, \u201CFor God so loved the world,\u201D John 3:16, \u201Cthat He gave His only begotten son. And who so ever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201D The problem is, we only focused on the last two stanzas about everlasting life and not \u201Cfor God so loved the world.\u201D And the world was who I cared about is \u2014 was my world. I was a teenage kid; I wanted to change the world. And they didn\u2019t care about changing the world. They just didn\u2019t care about the world. So when you went to college, Michigan State University, you weren\u2019t a religious person? No. I was unsuccessfully evangelized by groups of students on campus. We could put 10,000 people in the street in two hours\u2019 time in those days. We deployed students all over the state of Michigan like an army. We\u2019re very well organized, and I wasn\u2019t a Christian. I was \u2014 you know, I was pretty angry. I felt betrayed by the church. Though I never could quite get shed of Jesus to be honest. He was always kind of lingering and hanging around my head and my heart. But, no, I wasn\u2019t actively a Christian at all. Pretty angry, pretty oppositional to the churches in those days. So what pulled you back? Because I don\u2019t \u2014 I sense that\u2026 Yeah. \u2026a lot of your activism was around issues that you still care about today. So what pulled \u2014 drew you back to that \u2014 to faith, to\u2026 Yeah. \u2026organized religion even? I was, in those days, reading Ho Chi Minh, Che Guevara\u2026 Right. \u2026Karl Marx, like everybody was, you know? And I just didn\u2019t think that what I was reading and what I was finding, sort of, on the left was an adequate foundation or basis for life, and it wasn\u2019t deep enough. It wasn\u2019t strong enough. So I went back to the New Testament on my own, kind of one last time, and I began to read in the Book of Matthew. Just on my own. And I read the Sermon on the Mount. And amazingly, I had never heard a sermon in my home church on the Sermon on the Mount, which was the primary catechetical instruction for the early Christians. And I read it and I was just really, you know, fascinated. I was blown away by how radical it was. It was a change to everything \u2014 personal, spiritual, political, economic\u2026 Mm-hmm. Take \u2014 tell me just a line or two that, you know, that struck you then as central, that strike you still as \u2014 because somebody is listening, who doesn\u2019t know what this sermon \u2014 what\u2019s in the Sermon on the Mount. Well, the Beatitudes\u2026 And there\u2019s a lot of there, you know \u2014 yeah. But the \u2014 you know, Blessed are the poor, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the desire for justice, blessed are the peacemakers. You know, I was told my home church that that was for a different dispensation, they said, for the future, when we all get to heaven. Oh. When I was 14, I said, \u2018I think we need that now,\u2019 you know? Why would we need that in heaven, you know? But then I got to my conversion text, was later in the Book of Matthew, Matthew 25. And Jesus says, of course, famously, \u2018I was hungry, I was thirsty, I was naked, I was sick, I was a stranger, I was in prison. You never came to me.\u2019 \u201CAs you have done it to the least of these,\u201D He says, \u201Cyou have done it to me.\u201D Here\u2019s the Son of God sitting in judgment saying, \u2018How you treat those who were left out and left behind is the way I\u2019m going to regard you treating me.\u2019 Evangelical social activist Jim Wallis. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. And this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, the first in a two-part series, \u201CThe New Evangelical Leaders.\u201D In 1971, pursuing his renewed understanding of Christianity, Jim Wallis founded the magazine now known as Sojourners, which currently reaches 250,000 subscribers in print and online. But it was originally called The Post American. Our text was \u2014 this wonderful text in Romans 12, \u201CDon\u2019t be conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.\u201D In the one version, \u201CDon\u2019t let the world squeeze you into its mold.\u201D And we were dealing with a totally Americanized notion of religion. So we said, \u2018Let\u2019s call our publication The Post American.\u2019 Beyond, we\u2019re Christians first and whatever else, second or third or fourth. Very radical idea. And the first cover, Krista, you should see it. Here\u2019s a sculpt of Jesus wrapped in an American flag. All right. And the line on the cover of our publication was \u201CAnd They Crucified Him.\u201D Hmm. Way to start, you know, kind of building bridges\u2026 Right. \u2026to Evangelicals, you know? So that was like the first \u2014 it was tabloid newspaper printed by the same people in Chicago who did the Black Panther paper, you know? Right. And on the inside, I counted, there were like 12 clinched fists on that first issue of the magazine. It was against the war, you know? And it was about poverty and justice, but it was also about how Jesus was the foundation and the answer. And it was \u2014 really, it was written, Krista, more to students like we had been. It was written to the activist, radical students who weren\u2019t Christians, not to the churches. We thought \u2014 got a response from Christians around the country. It was like putting a flag up a flagpole, and those on the ground couldn\u2019t see each other but they could see that little flag of the flagpole, ran at the bottom of the pole, and that was the beginning of our constituency. Sojourners is now a big influential organization. And, you know, it\u2019s even a brand that\u2019s seen on CNN during a presidential debate, right? And I wonder if many people know that Sojourners was not just a publication, not just a, you know, an organization, but a community\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026a living community. Yeah. Did that begin when you moved to Washington in \u2014 when was that? No, it began\u2026 Back on 1975? You\u2019re exactly right. We say, we got to do this. We got to live this way. We got to \u2014 so first, we\u2019re in seminary. And then we \u2014 in seminary, we got a house off-campus. And we began to organize and mobilize, and we had these worship celebrations every week. And they drew all the alienated kids in the community, all the kids who were doing drugs and all of life\u2019s\u2026 So you\u2019re kind of a house church then? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. And we did rock and roll and we, you know, preached. It was really kind of \u2014 and it drew just hundreds and hundreds of people. And then we began to organize in Chicago. And we went to the inner city and we started a community. We went to very toughest, poorest neighborhoods uptown in Chicago and began to live among the poor, work among the poor. And then came to Washington and did the same in what was really the Washington war zones. And this was \u2014 we moved in here, and there was gunfire every night, and cabs wouldn\u2019t bring people to our neighborhood. And we tried, you know, in our own fledgling, very human, very flawed way to live. So it was a publication, it was a community, and it was a movement right from the start. We\u2019re traveling around the country and, you know, and \u2014 it is funny, now we\u2019re, you know, CNN or whatever. The experience for years, Krista, was speaking in a stadium without a microphone. And the way you do that is you talk to one section at a time and you keep moving around the stadium. I did that for years. And then you build up a constituency \u2014 very strong, very loyal. Well, now, we have the microphone, but we\u2019ve been in the stadium for years speaking without a microphone. But now, things have broken through in ways that we never really expected. And you still live in that Columbia Heights neighborhood, right\u2026 Yeah. \u2026with your \u2014 and now raising your family there. Yeah, yeah. I have a 4-year-old son and 9-year-old son. OK. So as you said, you\u2019ve been around doing this for a long time, in the stadium without a microphone. And you\u2019ve been an Evangelical. You\u2019ve been an Evangelical leader in some circles. You know, after the 2000 election, after the 2004 election, many Americans, many of my fellow journalists kind of woke up to Evangelical Christianity. Mm-hmm. As though it was almost a new phenomenon, or certainly new that it was so many Americans with so much potential power and actual power. But I wonder if you would tell me your story of who Evangelicals have been and, you know, kind of the diversity of the Evangelical movement that you\u2019ve represented for a long time in the same period of, you know, 30, 40 years that we\u2019re talking about, before Evangelical Christianity was a political force in the way it is now. Well, I\u2019m a 19th-century Evangelical, born in the wrong century. OK. Because back then, Charles Finney, Lucy Stone, the Grimke sisters, Jonathan Blanchard \u2014 these preachers, revivalists were also abolitionists. They led the antislavery campaign. They fought for women\u2019s suffrage. They fought for economic justice. In fact, Charles Finney, who was the evangelist, the Billy Graham of to his day, really pioneered the alter call. And the reason he did was he wanted to sign his converts up for the antislavery campaign. So faith got directed right to justice. Right. That is an incredible fact. Mm-hmm. So I want to hear Jim Wallis\u2019 explanation, narrative, of how, when Evangelical Christianity burst on to the political scene in the early 21st century, poverty was not one of the watchwords. Well, what happened was, if you look back \u2014 and I\u2019ve been just enthralled by this revival history, you know, these great awakenings. And the first one, the first great awakening led probably to spark the war, you know, the independence, and this new nation, this new sense of being a new people. The second one was Finney and the others about abolition of slavery and women suffrage. Third was William Jennings Bryan and the whole end-of-the-19th-century progressive movement \u2014 led to the New Deal and the Social Gospel. I think the fourth one was the black churches and how they were the foundation for the civil rights movement. Then we had this period where, literally, some political operatives on the right, overtly political operatives, had some meetings in this town, in Washington, D.C., with some of the television preachers, Falwell and Robertson. And they strike up a deal. So this was, I think, more a political movement than a religious one. But they grabbed issues that were important to Christians, like the sanctity of life or the health of marriage. But they turned it into a narrow agenda about abortion and gay marriage, and that was very successful for a period of time. But what people didn\u2019t understand was that underneath all that, there was real uneasiness and real dissention. There was always a more progressive Evangelical spirit. And it wasn\u2019t just Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo and Ron Sider. It was a growing kind of phenomenon. This new generation cares much more about the 30,000 children who died today globally because of totally unnecessary poverty and preventable disease, cares more about those 30,000 kids than they do about gay marriage amendments in Ohio. They really do. Progressive Evangelical leader Jim Wallis. We\u2019re at the beginning of what, I think, could be a new great awakening. I think we\u2019re at an edge of what could be a revival of faith that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m known more as a social activist, as you know. But I\u2019m saying right now that, you know, we won\u2019t get to social justice without a revival of faith, you know? The issues are too big. Too big to be left at just education or good organizing or the right program. And I think that point you\u2019re making that in your circles or in certain circles is new, because you talked about the fourth awakening, religious awakening, great awakening as the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, which had an incredible religious base. I mean Martin Luther King Jr.\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026was a preacher\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026and a theologian, first and foremost. But that got lost, as even people who carried that tradition forward, you know, the people who cared about that kind of social program and social justice\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026detached it\u2026 Exactly. Yeah. \u2026from that religious base, or inspiration, or grounding. Mm-hmm. So what went wrong on the left, you know, that also played into what led to the religious right in\u2026 Well, the subtitle of my last book was Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn\u2019t Get It. Yeah. It was both. You\u2019re right, the left became very secular. Now, I want to say religion has no monopoly on morality. I want to say that every time I speak, I say something like that. But the left got very kind of \u2014 they became like secular fundamentalists, you know, distaining religion, religious people, people of faith. And it really created a situation where the right seemed to own God. God was a Republican, obviously. And the left and the Democrats were hostile to faith and secular. And, you know, the polls about churchgoing people vote Republican, and all the rest. Well, now we see what Time magazine is calling \u201Ca leveling of the praying field.\u201D That was a nice phrase. Uh-huh. Now, you have three Democrats running for president who happened to be strong and authentic people of faith. And we had \u2014 we hosted all three of them on our CNN forum. The Republican side, there isn\u2019t a candidate who exemplifies a sort of, you know, conservative religious movement anymore. So I think that\u2019s good because God isn\u2019t a Republican or a Democrat, and faith shouldn\u2019t be on any parties\u2019 political pocket. We should be the ultimate swing vote, if you would, holding both sides accountable. So the changing agenda on the ground among Evangelicals, Catholics, mainline folks, the whole Jewish renewal that\u2019s going on, I\u2019m excited about. And I\u2019m talking to a lot of \u2014 you are, too \u2014 young Muslims. So something prophetic is growing again around the country. And I think it\u2019s going to change the whole political landscape. Politics is failing to solve the big issues. When that happens, social movements rise up to change politics. And the best social movements always have spiritual foundation. That\u2019s what revival is. That\u2019s a pretty big claim. And that\u2019s one thing we\u2019re going to\u2026 That\u2019s a pretty big claim. Yeah. I think that\u2019s \u2014 they\u2019re like mountains. I mean they\u2019re like big mountains \u2014 3 billion people living on $2 a day, 30,000 kids dying today. You say, how do we \u2014 these are too big for us. The odds are against us. How do we change that? Well, the Bible says, you got faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed, you can move mountains. But I think anything short of a revival of faith isn\u2019t going to be enough. So, you know, there were cries of theocracy or impending theocracy with the\u2026 Right. \u2026influence of conservative Evangelical Christians in the Bush White House. Mm-hmm. Right. And some people say that what you\u2019re talking about, while it\u2019s coming from a different direction, is also playing with the separation of church and state, crossing lines that seemed to have been drawn more firmly 10 years ago. It\u2019s a fair question. And I like to always answer because, you know, Martin Luther King Jr. had his Bible in one hand and the Constitution in the other hand. And I \u2014 he never endorsed a candidate and I never have either. He made them endorse his agenda. And while he navigated the course of power, his base was outside of them. Desmond Tutu in South Africa, after the ANC, the movement for liberation won, and they were the government, he\u2019d supported them, he stepped back and became a prophetic voice to the new government. So I think it\u2019s very important that we affirm the separation of church and state. That doesn\u2019t mean the segregation of moral values from public life. But also, it doesn\u2019t banish religious language from the public square as long as we are respectful of diversity and pluralism and democracy. Evangelical social activist Jim Wallis. Jim Wallis does not claim to represent the majority of American Evangelicals. But he does increasingly command an enthusiastic following among young Evangelicals. He attracted packed crowds at Christian colleges after the publication of his last book, God\u2019s Politics. Over 2,000 students turned out to hear Wallis at the prestigious Evangelical Wheaton College in Illinois, a place that once banned him from speaking during the Vietnam War years. Wallis noted in that speech that Wheaton College was founded by an abolitionist preacher, Jonathan Blanchard, a model of the 19th-century Evangelical impulse to social reform that he\u2019d like to resurrect. Here are more of Jim Wallis\u2019 remarks at Wheaton that drew a standing ovation. Jesus\u2019 first sermon at Nazareth. I call it his mission statement. He says, \u201CThe spirit of the Lord is upon me,\u201D it\u2019s His Nazareth manifesto. \u201CBecause He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.\u201D That\u2019s what it says, \u201Cgood news to the poor.\u201D And so, I want to say, whatever else our gospel is, however else it changes our lives, and it does, it changes everything about our lives. Our families \u2014 it changes our lives. But if our gospel is not good news to the poor, it\u2019s simply not the gospel of Jesus Christ. Conservative Evangelicals in America have created a Jesus who is pro-rich, pro-war, and only pro-American. That, that is a distortion, a misrepresentation of the Jesus of the Bible. I\u2019m doing an altar call now. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to get up and walk down the aisle. An altar call to a new generation of young Evangelicals, who are 19th-century Evangelicals for a 21st century, who wouldn\u2019t conceive of separating their faith in Jesus Christ from their passion for economic justice, I meet them all over the country. A new generation\u2019s rising up. And I\u2019m doing e-mail altar calls all over the country. If you care about this, I want your e-mail, to get you a part of the movement, to get you connected \u2014 it\u2019s free\u2026 This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, Jim Wallis\u2019 vision of how ending poverty could become part of the American Electoral agenda. In many ways, our radio program is just the beginning. We\u2019re making our material more portable and inviting you behind the scenes. You can download MP3s of this program and my entire unedited conversation with Jim Wallis through our Web site, our SOF podcast, and in our weekly e-mail newsletter. Discover more at speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, the first of two programs on new Evangelical leaders. Next week, we\u2019ll speak with The Purpose Driven Life author and entrepreneurial pastor Rick Warren, together with his wife, Kay. She\u2019s become a bridge-building force in the global fight against AIDS. The Warrens are a rising influence, primarily in traditionally conservative circles. My guest this hour, Jim Wallis, is influential primarily among progressive politicians, though both Wallis and Warren, in what also seems a sign of the times, are in collaboration across the partisan and cultural divides of recent years. Jim Wallis is best known as the founder and editor-in-chief of Sojourners, which has long been a leading voice of progressive social justice Evangelicalism. And especially since the publication of his 2005 book, God\u2019s Politics, Wallis has become something of a national celebrity, proposing a new agenda for religion in politics in what he calls the \u201Cpost-Religious Right era.\u201D Right now, Sojourners is planning a series of justice revivals across the U.S. This is a merger of two traditions that formed Jim Wallis: the Civil Rights Movement and the mass public revivals of Billy Graham. Some see Wallis himself as a kind of Billy Graham figure for a new era, and he, too, has positioned himself as a pastor and spiritual advisor to powerful people. I asked Jim Wallis about this. Billy Graham was always very warm to me, always, always welcoming the new generation. Mm-hmm. Agreeing with so much of what we were saying. He said the world would be surprised how much I agree with what you\u2019re trying to do and say. And, and that tradition is powerful to me, but it\u2019s the Finneyists, the ones who linked faith to social justice very directly, that really fire my heart. So, I think we want to build movements outside of the corridors of power, but then, you want to be able to speak to them. Right now, I\u2019ve \u2014 there\u2019s these open doors \u2014 Gordon Brown, the new prime minister of Great Britain, has been a friend for 10 years. We\u2019ve been having breakfast and talking for 10 years. Kevin Rudd is to become the prime minister in Australia. Catholic, very committed\u2026 Hmm. \u2026very smart guy. Five languages, he speaks. We\u2019ve been having dinner and talking. I am friends with some of the ones running for president here. I think we\u2019re going to have some open doors in some of the key capitals of the world. And when you say open doors, open to what? Well, Gordon Brown once said over breakfast one day, he said, you know, for the first time in history, we have the knowledge and technology and information, and resources to end extreme poverty as we know it. What we don\u2019t have, he said, is the moral and the political will. He looks across the table at 11 Downing Street and he says, \u2018That\u2019s your job, in the churches, that\u2019s your job.\u2019 And who was \u2014 was this when you met with, was this you or was this you and a group of other Evangelical leaders? Well, the first time he said that was to me over breakfast, just the two of us, but then he said that to \u2014 I brought a bunch of leaders back for the G8 in Britain and he said a similar thing to all of them. Brown, I think, is the head of state around the world right now. The one who has the deepest passion for an issue like global poverty. He has it deep in his soul. And I think we\u2019re going to have a new generation of leaders now. I was just in Singapore, as I said, and the global south is rising up around the world, and there are some new leaders there too\u2026 Yeah. \u2026in the poorest countries. New, powerful political leader. And what I\u2019m saying is that social movements will be necessary to make real progress on the big issues. And historically, those who generally had spiritual foundations. OK. And, you know, I think I may have met you the first time, we were both attending a conference and it was in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I think it was a couple of months after that. Hmm. Mm-hmm. I had a sense in those weeks and months after Hurricane Katrina and I sensed \u2014 I believe you spoke about this as well \u2014 that it had really woken people up in this country, and it was no longer possible to ignore poverty in that great American city and others, racial isolation in that great city and others. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s been picked up on. I\u2019m so, I mean, tell me, how you experience that? Are there things you\u2019re seeing out there that I\u2019m not? I think you\u2019re right about Katrina, where we saw the people who were left behind\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026had already been left out in American society. So natural disasters often reveal the great disaster of the way the world is structured. But I still think the teachable lesson from Katrina \u2014 and even 9/11 \u2014 is still there. It\u2019s around, I see it all the time on the road, and I do think that the new altar call for the new revival is going to be, like the slogan in the movement in Britain a few years ago, called Make Poverty History. Poverty and human trafficking and HIV as an issue that reveals that the inequality of the world is really going to be at the heart of this revival. But do we know, do we know how to eradicate poverty? Well, we have these three obstacles. One is, the poor have not been a priority. Two is, we have a debate about strategy. And three is the real one: We don\u2019t know poor people. Liberals or conservatives don\u2019t really know. Poor people are utterly segregated. They don\u2019t live all over the country; they live only in certain places. And, you know, until poor people are our friends, not just the objects of our concern on the liberal side or the people who are to blame for their own misfortunes on the conservative side, how can anybody say that out of wedlock birth and family breakdown and addictions are not a causal fact of poverty? How can anyone say that not affording health care and having no affordable housing to \u2014 and having education that doesn\u2019t educate aren\u2019t causes of poverty? I think what I hear you\u2019re saying is that poverty, in fact, brings together both the issues of family life, right, and addiction\u2026 Right, mm-hmm. \u2026that are in sanctity of life that are important to conservative Christians. And also the issues of policy and the social justice issues that maybe liberals traditionally would define as their moral values issues. Is that\u2026 Yeah. The biblical notion is that the truth about a society is much better known from the bottom of that society then from the top. We did this experiment way back a long time ago, as young seminarians, we found every passage in the Bible about poor people, about wealth and poverty, oppression, all that, and we found several thousand verses. It was the second most prominent theme in the Hebrew scripts, the Old Testament. And in the New Testament, the Synoptic Gospels, the first three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, one of every 16 verses. Hmm. In Luke, it was one of every seven verses. And we took the Bible and we took a pair of scissors and we cut out of the Bible every single reference to poor people. And when we were done, the Bible was in shreds. It was full of holes, falling apart in my hands. I\u2019d take it out to preach. I\u2019d say, \u2018Brothers and sisters, this is the American Bible. It\u2019s just full of holes.\u2019 I still have that old Bible now, full of holes, ripped to shreds. What\u2019s happening now, Krista, is our Bibles are being put back together again by a new generation. This isn\u2019t about politics or a liberal or a conservative. This is about the integrity of the word of God. There\u2019s nothing as basic as this, how we treat the other, the vulnerable, the poor, the enemy. The one who\u2019s not at the table is the one we\u2019re going to be judged by. Evangelical social activist Jim Wallis. I\u2019m Krista Tippet and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. This week and next, \u201CThe New Evangelical Leaders.\u201D In 2006, Jim Wallis\u2019 Sojourners community merged with Call to Renewal, another organization he founded. This advocacy initiative brings a broad range of Christian groups together across the political spectrum to address poverty and the manifold dynamics that make it possible. And, you know, I just want to push this a little bit more. I mean, Sojourners has been a pretty traditional social action urban organization. You know, you said that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve seen the limits of politics, and I think we\u2019ve also seen, you know, the limits of tactics. Mm-hmm. And so, you know, do you see new ways to really help people, not just care about these issues because I think\u2026 Right. \u2026people do care, but often, they care and they just are, you know, overwhelmed by the idea that there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. Oh, I think that\u2019s right. So, maybe you would talk about people you know about or projects, where those connections are being made in new and fresh ways. You work on these issues and \u2014 we\u2019ve done all of it. We\u2019ve done food coops and tutoring and we\u2019ve done housing coops. We\u2019ve run homeless shelters, all the stuff. It\u2019s all good. And it changes us to start to change our lives. Right. And finally, you can\u2019t keep pulling bodies out of the river and not send somebody upstream to see what or who is throwing them in. You know, Salvation Army founders Catherine and William Booth, radical Evangelicals in their day. They said you can\u2019t keep picking up bodies at the bottom of the mountain and not climb the hill and see who\u2019s pushing them off the edge. Now, I think the line is not from service to just politics. The line\u2019s got to be from service to movement. You saw that movie this year, Amazing Grace about William Wilberforce. Mm-hmm. Very dynamic, charismatic parliamentarian. What it didn\u2019t show was the \u201Cprairie fire\u201D movement all through the U.K. of ordinary people who wouldn\u2019t put sugar in their tea because the plantations were making sugar made by slaves, harvested by slaves, and the slave movements themselves, the rebellions in Jamaica. What I \u2014 in D.C., you know, I often talk to people who are going to lobby on the Hill about this or that. And I say here\u2019s how you recognize a member of Congress. They\u2019re the ones walking around with their fingers up in the air. And then they lick their finger and they put it back up and they see which way the wind is blowing. You can\u2019t change a nation by replacing one wet-fingered politician with another. You change a nation when you change the wind. You change the way the wind is blowing, it\u2019s amazing how quickly they respond. And so you look at Selma, Alabama, and how that led to a Voting Rights Act five months later. Johnson had told King just before Selma, it\u2019ll take five years to get a Voting Rights Act. King said, I can\u2019t wait five years. Mm-hmm. He organized Selma. And we\u2019ve got to now be wind-changers. Not lobbyists, but wind-changers. How do we \u2014 by our service, by our doing in our lives \u2014 how do we then join together and knit together a movement that holds politics accountable? So if you were imagining, you know, what would your dream of the 2008 version of Selma be? You know, this is what we have to make happen in five months. Well, one thing we\u2019re actually working on is for a long time, I was focusing on trying to put poverty on the agenda for this election in a way it hadn\u2019t been before. And we\u2019re making some progress. We\u2019re now thinking of having something six months after the election where we invite the new president \u2014 whoever he or she is \u2014 to come and announce their bold plan for a serious poverty reduction that will involve all of us in the context of the faith community. I want to see national efforts \u2014 this nation, for example, is not very far away from the people saying do something about health care. I mean\u2026 Right. \u2026some polls show that people will even spend more taxes on their money to find health care solutions. And so\u2026 And so, again \u2014 when you think\u2026 It\u2019s leadership\u2026 \u2026is health care part of the idea of poverty? Sure. Absolutely. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s included in that. Now, so, I think there\u2026 Yeah. \u2026has been some wisdom, some political wisdom in recent years that you can\u2019t mobilize Americans around an issue like poverty the way you can mobilize them around issues of self-interest or personal interest. I mean, do you think that\u2019s true? You know, I\u2019m on campuses all the time. And you know, students I meet, I always hear back two words. We\u2019re looking for meaning and we\u2019re looking for connection. And I think it\u2019s our need to connect with those that we\u2019ve left out and left behind. I love the Isaiah text where it says that your healing \u2014 Isaiah 58 \u2014 your healing is tied up in your response to those who have been left out and left behind. This nation needs to be healed of our divisions, our deep inequalities, our \u2014 we don\u2019t know each other and we\u2019re diminished by that. So I think it is something that at a deeper sense is in our best interest. Finally, to affirm the common good, the common good, which is a very biblical notion, is in our own best interest. I want my kids to be raised in a country that values the common good and not just the survival of the fittest. (Sound bite of music) Sometimes I say the Religious Right has been replaced by Jesus, and I think that\u2019s true. I think there\u2019s something so compelling about the figure of Jesus. You go to any street corner and ask anybody there \u2014 whether they\u2019re believers or not \u2014 what they think of Jesus. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, you know, He hung out with poor people and prostitutes and sinners and He was compassionate and loving and He was for peace.\u2019 You always get that. Then you ask what they think of Christians. You get a whole different set of adjectives thrown evangelically. Mm-hmm. It gets pretty nasty what you hear. And yet, this is the gospel of Jesus. Not the gospel about Jesus, but the gospel of Jesus that\u2019s drawing people from so many places. So I see Evangelicals, a new generation and they\u2019re just being drawn to this radical vision of Jesus and the kingdom. I see Catholic social teaching coming alive again. I see mainline churches, but I\u2019m particularly seeing an immigrant church, I\u2019m seeing a new generation of black Christians, you know, who aren\u2019t content with singing the praises of the civil rights movement. They want to make their own history for justice. Latino Christians, Asian-American Christians who don\u2019t want the assimilationist ethic of their parents. They want to change their neighborhoods. They\u2019re creating, I think, what I\u2019d call a post-white church in America, where we\u2019re beginning to look like the church of the global south. That\u2019s where Christianity is growing in the global south. And it\u2019s deeply personal but it\u2019s being applied to changing the facts of HIV, or climate change, or poverty. So I think, you know, something new is happening. And I think a particular narrow American view \u2014 going back to our first name in the magazine, Post American \u2014 that\u2019s happening now. Globalization has inevitable logic, has no comparable ethic. And so, perhaps, international communities of faith could help supply the ethics for globalization, the rules of a global neighborhood that come from the prophetic tradition that\u2019s embedded in all of our great religious faith communities. A great line, which was the first line of one of your books: \u201CHope is believing in spite of the evidence, then watching the evidence change.\u201D Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah. What were you thinking of when you wrote that? And how do you \u2014 have you lived into that sentence? When I was growing up, the choice was between belief and secularism. So\u2026 Right. It was like there\u2019s this monster called secular humanism. It\u2019s going to eat your children, you know? Right. That was the big choice. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the big choice. There is a big choice, though. The big choice today for us is the one between hope and cynicism. Hope is not a feeling or a personality type. It\u2019s a decision wherever change has come. It\u2019s because some people believed in that possibility before it came to be. It\u2019s hope as a decision that makes change possible. And I think that choice for hope is the most important contribution the faith community has to make to the world, the promise and the power of hope. Things can change. They have and they will. And that\u2019s always something that we insist upon because our God, finally, is bigger than all the things that we think are so big. Jim Wallis is editor-in-chief of Sojourners magazine.
