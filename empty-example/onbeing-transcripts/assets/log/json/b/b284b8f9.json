  "fullText": "The philosopher Simone Weil defined prayer as \u201Cabsolutely unmixed attention.\u201D The artist Ann Hamilton embodies this notion in her sweeping works of art that bring all the senses together. Her creations are literally astounding: 42 giant wooden swings that pull on a white, silk curtain; an 80-foot concrete tower with a staircase that resembles a double helix. But they\u2019re also poetic and intimate: a wooden meditation boat in Laos; a pinhole camera placed inside the mouth, merging sight and voice and making photographs with every opening and closing. I think one of the questions that is behind a lot of the things I\u2019m working on is, where is it that we can gather and kind of be alone together? And, you know, there\u2019s so much, as we all know, \u201Cus/them.\u201D And what are the circumstances for \u201Cwe,\u201D that I can enjoy the pleasure of something I\u2019m seeing here, knowing that I\u2019m also sharing that with a person next to me? And there\u2019s an interesting kind of intimacy with this total stranger that the situation makes possible. And that that can change your whole day. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Ann Hamilton prefers to be called a \u201Cmaker\u201D rather than an artist. She also teaches at Ohio State University. I spoke with her in 2014, before a live audience at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Ann, you know \u2014 we haven\u2019t met before. In fact, we\u2019re just now meeting. This is live \u2026 Literally laying eyes on each other. Yeah. But you\u2019ve come up in the show. You and your work have been discussed. And I\u2019m probably going to look at my notes more than I usually do because your language is so precise, and original, and beautiful. Oh, thank you. And I want to really work with the way you put words together. Let\u2019s just leap in. So you were born in, is it lee-ma or lie-ma, Ohio? Lie-ma. Lima, Ohio. And you grew up in Columbus. And I wonder if you would just \u2014 you know, I think a lot of people speak of you as a spiritual artist, or an artist who is in the realm of spirituality. I have to say, I don\u2019t really see you claiming that word so often. Yeah, I mean, I think that word makes me very nervous, because I don\u2019t actually know exactly what it means. And I think that it\u2019s a word that is, for a lot of people, very loaded, and means very particular things. Right. And, so, you know, I think artists are slippery, that we want to not be categorized, right? So if I ask you, what was the spiritual background of your childhood, in the best connotations you could fill that word with? What do you think of? Love. I\u2019m a Calvinist, I think. And I certainly grew up going to church with my family, but you know, it\u2019s hard to know sometimes what parts of that you absorb. Yeah. I remember my grandmother saying, well, just take the parts you like and don\u2019t worry about the rest of it. I don\u2019t think she was a very good Calvinist by the sound of it. But also, I think, growing up where you worked hard, and labor was its own reward, and you took care of people that you loved, and I grew up in a very tight family. So, here\u2019s something you said. I think I\u2019m putting some words together. But, you talk about \u201Cthe tactile experience of words\u201D and \u201Cthe tactile experience of things\u201D as a space we\u2019re always straddling. And I\u2019d love for you to talk about what you mean by that. And again, trace, you know, where that awareness \u2014 how and when and where that arose in you. I think I know. I was very close with my grandmother. And I have really distinct bodily memories of sitting next to her on the couch. You know, and you\u2019re little and you kind of get in that space under her arm and her arms were full. And, we would knit, or needlepoint, and she would read. And I think there\u2019s something about the rhythm of the hands being busy and then your body falls open to absorb and concentrate on what you\u2019re listening to, but not completely, because you have two concentrations. And then from that, that sort of cultivates a kind of attention. That is the rhythm of those two things together. So the unfolding of the voice in space, and then the material accreting under your hand, and they have really different satisfactions. But you can see the material \u2026 And she was actually making \u2014 she was making. She was a maker. She was a maker. And she was making sweaters. Sweaters \u2026 She was making things you wore. Yeah, or we were needlepointing, or I \u2014 all those lap things. The making by hand. And that was tremendously comforting. You also said this lovely thing that textiles are the first house of the body. Yeah. The first, what do you say? The first \u2014 the body\u2019s first\u2026 Architecture. \u2026extension. Yeah. It\u2019s that question, how do we know things? And that we grow up or we\u2019re educated in a world that ascribes a lot of value to those things that we can say or name. But they\u2019re all these hundreds of ways that we know things, through our skin, which is the largest organ of our body. And, so, you know, my first hand is that textile hand, and text and textiles are woven always, experientially for me. And then, I think that when I first started making things out of cloth, it was like it was another skin. So I was thinking about it as an animate surface, and thinking about it as something that both covers and reveals. And you also draw out this notion of threads, that there\u2019s threads of sewing, and threads of ideas. Yeah. Lines of speech. Right. And the weaving that happens with both words and substances like that. Yeah, and that\u2019s ancient. That is like the origins are in those \u2014 the thread pulled from the body in so many cultures or something across space and time. You know, when you\u2019re reading a book, you\u2019re immersed, and you\u2019re both inside that book, and you\u2019re far away in the world that it might take you to. I feel like there\u2019s something \u2014 as you said, this is ancient, right? That we take in things through our body and it\u2019s working with our hands, and that it\u2019s not all just verbal, but\u2026 Right. \u2026I don\u2019t know, I said to somebody recently, I\u2019m trying to think who it was \u2014 it\u2019s another interview. I feel like Descartes has a lot to answer for. I think it was Eve Ensler, because she\u2019s also so much about knowing our bodies, and inhabiting our bodies and actually how\u2026 Trusting that knowledge. \u2026we got away from that in Western civilization. We made everything very cerebral, including spirituality. Right. And as you said, I mean, these \u2014 I don\u2019t know, the image of your grandmother with her needlepoint, and the knitting sweaters. It\u2019s an old art. It feels like a lost art. But it\u2019s humanizing when we rediscover these things. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you know, it\u2019s interesting, because I teach in a university, and I think about, where\u2019s the place in that kind of educational institution for embodied knowledge? \u201CEmbodied knowledge.\u201D I love that phrase. Yes. And how do we cultivate that? And how do we trust it? I think that\u2019s a big thing. How do we listen to it? That, I think, sometimes we\u2019re very busy giving what we know away, because we think it doesn\u2019t have any authority, or like, it\u2019s almost like we give our experiences away, because we don\u2019t know how to trust\u2026 What do you mean? What do you mean that we give them away? I\u2019m thinking as an artist. Yeah. That, when you\u2019re making something, you don\u2019t know what it is for a really long time. So, you have to kind of cultivate the space around you, where you can trust the thing that you can\u2019t name. And if you feel a little bit insecure, or somebody questions you, or you need to know what it is, then what happens is you give that thing that you\u2019re trying to listen to away. And so, how do you kind of cultivate a space that allows you to dwell in that not knowing, really? That is actually really smart, and can become really articulate? But, you know, like the thread has to come out, and it comes out at its own pace. Right. Yeah. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today at the Minneapolis Institute of Art with the artist Ann Hamilton. I think it\u2019s so important just to note that what you\u2019re describing, which in some ways you receive through this lineage, I feel, of your grandmother, right, and then you\u2019ve run with it as an artist. Right. But, cutting-edge science is now showing us that all these things that we\u2019ve tried to talk about come in through our bodies first. Right. Including, I mean, the dark side, right? Trauma, but also our whole experience, our whole experience of the world is never just mental or verbal. Right. And we\u2019re supposed to be moving around all the time. So, if you need to move\u2026 But yeah, and it\u2019s like \u2014 I think the other part of it is that I think about the experience of maybe walking through the museum or taking in experience. It\u2019s at the pace of the body moving through space. And that it isn\u2019t that we sit and have an idea, or that we sit and, I don\u2019t know, ingest things in a certain way. It\u2019s through moving in space that something becomes absorbed and comes to be felt. Also what strikes me is, you\u2019re talking about an experience where we kind of rediscover our wholeness, right? But there\u2019s also this social aspect. I mean, you said, it\u2019s across space and time, but it\u2019s also in, you know, in the threads of a garment, or in the words that make a story, or a book. It\u2019s also our connection to everyone else. Right. Well, and it\u2019s like in a \u2014 to go back to the knitting, like in the knitted structure, you can take a sweater, or a sock, and you can see each loop up and around and slip through, and up and around and over. And, so, in that whole that has become, it never loses all the parts that constitute it. And so I think that that\u2019s also been a part of, I don\u2019t know, structuring the work in some way, where every act of it is in some ways transparently present in the material. And that you can see that. Even as you can see the whole, you can see the \u2026 Even as you can see the whole, you can see all the parts and, that we \u2014 you go back and forth between those. Oh, so much to talk about. I want, something you kind\u2026 Can I say something? Yes. You can interrupt me any time. Can I interrupt you? This is your conversation. I wanted to say partly that, like, I\u2019m a radio person. I love \u2014 we don\u2019t have a TV in our house, and it\u2019s not because\u2026 \u201COh, I\u2019m not going to have a TV.\u201D It just hasn\u2019t ever arrived, much to my son\u2019s chagrin. But I\u2019ve listened to radio a lot, and so I\u2019ve been listening to your program for a long time and, then the podcasts. But, in the intimacy of the voice, like, I feel like you\u2019re already my friend. And the voice coming in and being as I drink tea or I work, and the kind of comfort of that, and I think that partly in work, it\u2019s like wanting to keep that kind of intimacy that I experience with a form of radio that is the form you work in. And at the same time, create an experience that is like everybody. It\u2019s like a condition that allows many, many people to occupy together. Even in the \u2014 in their kind of aloneness. Yes. And so, if I think about radio, I think, you know, that someone else is hearing that in the same intimate way. And so I\u2019m also joined to all those people. And, there\u2019s something about seeking the quality of that experience that seems very important. Yes, I think it can be intensely individual and intensely communal at the same time. Yeah. A friend of mine who\u2019s a wonderful poet, Susan Stewart, said that \u201Chearing is how we touch at a distance.\u201D Isn\u2019t that beautiful? Yeah, it is. Yeah. That\u2019s why we need our poets. And so, how our \u2014 I guess in some ways, for me, one of the questions is, how do you make the condition for tactile experience, which isn\u2019t literally always touching? Yeah. But I think that\u2019s also how \u2014 like, how I start projects is, in some ways, just to try to listen. And what is the form of that listening for what something needs to become? Or to find the question. Or, you know, listening is obviously a very specific thing in a conversation, but also as a practice, for me, because I respond to spaces, the first architecture maybe is the coat. But then the next one is this building around us. And the felt quality of that already has all this, as you say, information in it. And so, it\u2019s like, what is it that is here that maybe asks a question or that can be brought forward \u2026 You\u2019re listening to the space. You\u2019re listening. Yeah. It\u2019s so true that it\u2019s \u2014 I also think listening is something we really have to practice, because our everyday spaces are not set up for listening. It\u2019s always something you have to create\u2026 It\u2019s like saying now I\u2019m going to listen. \u2026the space to do and the intention to do. Or we\u2019re plugged in. You know? Right. It\u2019s very hard for me to wear headphones at all or sunglasses because then I feel like I\u2019m not where I am, wherever that is. I\u2019m not here. And there\u2019s some filter going on. But it\u2019s also, how do you listen to yourself? And how do you trust the \u2026 Which we\u2019re also not necessarily good at. Yeah, we override that a lot. I do want you to tell the story of one of the early, early projects you did, maybe a first project when you were a student, about \u2014 where you had a suit covered in toothpicks. Which, actually, when you look at the picture, you kind of look like Bigfoot. Yeah. Why was that important for you? Because you\u2019ve said that that was a really important project. Yeah. That\u2019s a really great question. So what Krista is describing is a man\u2019s suit that I covered with thousands of individual toothpicks that had been painted black with little white tips. So I made a hide that I could put on. Yeah, and it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, the photo, as I said, it doesn\u2019t look like toothpicks, it looks like\u2026 It looks like hair or a spiny\u2026 \u2026a spiny, yeah, for \u2026 \u2026like porcupine\u2026 Yes. \u2026sort of thing. And, I was in graduate school then. And, I was incredibly self-conscious. You know, you\u2019re really worried about, are you \u2014 what you \u2014 is it good? There\u2019s a lot of pressure to articulate. You kind of leave behind, I think, when you go to graduate school, a lot of things that you\u2019ve shored up a tiny bit of confidence with. And so\u2026 And I had made a project, maybe this is important to know that it was in my first like critique in graduate school, and it was an awful project. It was really, really bad. But I had all sorts of words that I could put with, like, why I had done it all. And I realized that that wasn\u2019t what I really cared about. And, so I thought, is there a way to take this kind of maybe emotional predicament or the self-consciousness and find a physical form for that? And in inhabiting it, does it then change my relationship to that fear? Or to that\u2026 So that suit represented how you felt, which was all spiny and conspicuous. Right, yes. And \u2026 That\u2019s really interesting. Yeah, and so, you know, it\u2019s almost like if I can be in it, then it\u2019s like, how does your own vulnerability then become a place of incredible strength? And that if you can just occupy that, then there\u2019s a whole lot of knowledge in there. Hmm. That makes me think of something that\u2019s disconnected, but it was just on my mind. Somebody I interviewed years ago, Jean Vanier, who created these communities around the world that are centered around people with mental disabilities. Yes. And he talked about the reason he believes that so many of us are so uncomfortable with people with disabilities, that we all walk around, all the time, you know, trying to hide whatever\u2019s wrong with us, or whatever we think is wrong with us, and that the people who have \u2014 who carry their, you know, their flaws on the outside are terrifying\u2026 Right. \u2026because we spend so much energy trying to keep that to ourselves. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I think, when I first started teaching, my students called it the public humiliation class. And it wasn\u2019t that it was so humiliating. It was really that I was asking them to do things in public that were about taking a risk. You know, and that if you can do that, if you can let yourself fail, if you can let yourself be really bad, if you can take the risk\u2026 Or does it look awkward on purpose? \u2026look awkward, then you can do a whole lot of other things after that. Yeah. Something that also is really intriguing to me is how you talk about using time. Time itself as a process and a material. Can you say some more about that? Well, I think in some ways, I don\u2019t know the best way to say it, but that, like everybody, you know, our lives are really, really busy. And we\u2019re fragmented in many ways. And I think that within the work, I try to make time for those things that, in some ways, it\u2019s hard for me to maybe make time for in my daily life. So, in the project last year at the Armory, which was a really large project, and it had a whole rhythm to the day, that I was there every day, all day, learning what it was. And I understood that it was really important for me to spend all that time to actually come to understand it, and it was interesting to then be joined, I think, by other people in the time there. I don\u2019t think this really answers your question, but\u2026 Well, but what you\u2019re getting at is how I think so many of us in our lives now we \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like we receive time as kind of a bully, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it\u2019s all about deadlines. Which we\u2019re not meeting. Never. Or only at the last minute. And all the things we can\u2019t get to do. So, we kind of receive time passively. And of course, the physicists tell us that our whole sense of time is completely illusory \u2014 we don\u2019t get it. We can\u2019t internalize what it really is anyway. And so what you\u2019re talking about is actually kind of claiming time as a thing that you\u2019re grappling with, and also working with. And actually, I mean, you\u2019re kind of insisting that it be more generous. Yeah, and I think that in many ways, it\u2019s, like, how do you let things take the time they actually need? It seems like this whole efficiency thing doesn\u2019t work very well, because in fact, there\u2019s this thinking that\u2019s always going on inside the thing that you\u2019re engaged with and, you\u2019re not really having the experience if you\u2019re rushing off to the next thing, right? So, even when you\u2019re really, really compressed for time, how do you cultivate just being in the time you have at that moment? And how do you \u2014 how can you just be present, even if it\u2019s like, you know, a few minutes? Which is a spiritual discipline, I think. Yeah, maybe. But you\u2019re, I mean \u2014 it\u2019s a practical discipline, too. It\u2019s practical. Yeah. And so how do you kind of push things off as long as possible? And I think even in my process, I wait as long as possible to say what something\u2019s going to be. You know, I try to suspend all the possibilities until the very last moment, because I know that what something needs to become needs all of that time. Tell me about your relationship with technology. I mean, you said you don\u2019t have a TV, but you\u2019ve done digital prints. Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah, but I think you also said some interesting things about, you know, technology amplifying human presence at a distance, which can be, like all of this, it can be dark and light. I mean, I think, you know, the incredible thing about technology is it amplifies and extends our reach, the reach of a voice, greater than the reach of one\u2019s touch. And so, I think one of my questions has been, what is the value or form of making by hand, or making at the pace of the body, when we live in this technologically extended time? You could almost say \u2014 what was it? What was this phrase of yours? That textiles are the first house of the body, and then you said physical space is the second house, and there\u2019s a way in which these virtual spaces we inhabit are a new piece of architecture for our lives. Well, and so partly, it\u2019s like, so, how is that tactile? Yeah. You know, and how \u2014 where is the \u2014 and what\u2019s the nature of the \u201Cwe\u201D in that? And I haven\u2019t really done, like, an online project particularly, but I spend tons of time on my computer, and I do a ton of research on it. And what I can find is extraordinary. And I wouldn\u2019t ever want to lose that. Yeah. It\u2019s a treasure trove. And on the other hand, I\u2019m scissors and glue, and Scotch tape, and whatever. And so it\u2019s more like, how do you balance the screen, and what it makes possible with \u2014 which is often the faraway \u2014 with the kind of close at hand? But, you know, there\u2019s a generation that\u2019s growing up thinking inside the technology in a way that, you know, isn\u2019t my generation. Right, for whom it really is a house in a way that it\u2019s never going to be a house for someone who was 40 when it came along. Right. You can listen again and share this conversation with Ann Hamilton through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with the visual artist Ann Hamilton. She calls herself a \u201Cmaker.\u201D She creates visionary installations that engage and surround the senses: a stonework wall in the middle of Battery Park City in New York, or 50,000 catalogue cards at the San Francisco Main Library, each one annotated with a quote related to the book described on the card. I met Ann Hamilton as part of the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s 2014 exhibit and project called \u201CSacred.\u201D We spoke in front of a live audience there. Let\u2019s just talk for a few more minutes, and then we\u2019ll open this open up. There\u2019s so much I want to talk to you about. Oh, all right, so, tell us about your pinhole camera. So, everybody knows what a pinhole camera is. No, no, you have to explain it. Oh, I do? OK. So, a pinhole camera, I guess it\u2019s like the radio. I mean, it\u2019s magic. OK, it\u2019s crystal clear now. So, it\u2019s a dark box with a tiny, little hole in it. And the light that goes through that hole makes an image on the back of the box. And so, it\u2019s the first camera. It\u2019s one of the very earliest way of making an image. And so, I started a project where I made pinhole cameras that were very small, that would fit inside the cavity of my mouth. And I started thinking about my mouth as a room. And I became interested in thinking about what happens when one sense is displaced to another part of the body. So, if the sense of sight is joined to the place of voice, what results from that? And when I interviewed Meredith Monk, who\u2019s a wonderful, again, vocalist, artist, performance artist, and you\u2019ve done some fabulous work with her. The project that you did together called \u201CMercy\u201D also had this relationship between the mouth and the hand. Again, joining those different\u2026 The first extensions. \u2026senses. Yeah. And she told a story about \u2014 you both, together, saw a story of a father and a son who were both shot at the Israeli-Palestinian border by both sides. These people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time in a tragic way. And Meredith talked about how you realized that you can \u2014 a hand can hold a trigger, a hand can reach out to touch someone \u2026 Right. And we made, I think, at one point in that project \u2014 I mean, certainly we were responding politically to \u2014 the newspaper comes in every day, and that becomes part of your landscape of response. What\u2019s happening in the world, and how can your small act, singular act of making have any consequence? And so, the only thing you can do is think about the consequence of your immediate extension and how you do that. And so, we made a list, actually, at one point, I think of all the \u2014 all the things the hand can do. And all of the, kind of, appetites and qualities of what the voice can do. And that those are actions. And how do we own that? How do we own that? Is that partly what you\u2019re, a little bit? Yeah, it made me think of \u2014 I was in Israel for the first time a couple of years ago, and we were going to the Wailing Wall, which, you know, I think I wanted to be overtaken by a sense of mystery and God\u2019s presence, and I was, in fact, I was irritated by the separation of the genders, and it was hot, it was touristy, but, when I \u2014 have you been there? You walk up to the wall, and here\u2019s the thing. To me, it wasn\u2019t even the prayer that made it incredibly powerful. It was putting \u2014 it was putting my hands on that wall and thinking of all of the\u2026 Hands. \u2026million, all of the hands. Right. And that you\u2019re joining those. Yes. And that felt sacred. Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. And I think we\u2019re trying to, in many ways, trying to find opportunities in which we can have that experience. And we can feel our own presence, gesture, whatever, in relationship to that much larger one across time, and space, and cultures. And so, as an artist working in a contemporary context, it\u2019s like, how do we \u2014 how can we create a circumstance in which those kinds of processes of joining and acknowledgement can occur? Here\u2019s something you said, also, that is related to this. I just \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful thought and I have to sit with it. \u201CThe body, through physical labor, leaves a transparent presence in material. And labor is a way of knowing.\u201D Mm-hmm. Yeah, I\u2019m always going through this museum, attracted to those things where you feel the presence, in some way or another, or the evidence, in the material of the body. So the worn steps that are in a marble staircase, the way you feel a handrail when you go up. That, consciously or unconsciously, your body is aware of those things. And I\u2019m just looking at where my attention falls. And it\u2019s to this odd, sort of, disparate category of objects, but in some ways what connects all of them is that there\u2019s some evidence of someone else\u2019s body in that object. And you know, we\u2019re in a museum that is full of that. Yes, again, that just is a\u2026 And there\u2019s recognition, yeah. \u2026way to talk about what is so special about a museum. Yeah. Well, and that you fall open to those things. Yes. And even if you don\u2019t know its history, or you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from, and you can\u2019t place it in time, there\u2019s still this recognition that is very strong, and that recognition makes you curious. And makes you fall open. And when you fall open to it, then your heart falls open, right? And anything is possible. So, this place, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, has the \u201CSacred\u201D exhibit now. And this conversation we\u2019re having is part of this event, this \u201CSacred\u201D event. Right. There\u2019s some similarity between the atmosphere of explicitly sacred places and the atmosphere in a museum. Right? I mean, how many spaces in this culture do we stand silently and take something in, and soak in beauty, and be in awe of that? Well, and, I think when you go through the doors, like, if you go through the doors of a church, you know, you enter that threshold and it\u2019s a different space, and the air is different, and it\u2019s maybe more quiet\u2026 Yeah, time is different, I think, too. You\u2019re willing to just sit and be. And I think that we come needing that a lot to the museums, very much so. Never thought about that before. And, I think also as an artist, I\u2019m very \u2014 I think one of the questions that is behind a lot of the things I\u2019m working on is, where is it that we can gather and, kind of, be alone together? And, you know, there\u2019s so much, as we all know, \u201Cus/them.\u201D And what are the circumstances for \u201Cwe,\u201D that I can enjoy the pleasure of something I\u2019m seeing here, knowing that I\u2019m also sharing that with a person next to me? And there\u2019s an interesting kind of intimacy with this total stranger that the situation makes possible. And that that can change your whole day. Yeah. It\u2019s another one of those experiences, like we were talking about radio, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 that it\u2019s communal and individual at the same time. Yeah, and I think that that \u201Calone together\u201D\u2026 And that art is like that, too. \u2026that maybe too much \u201Ctogether\u201D makes us really nervous. But the \u201Calone together\u201D is something that I think we\u2019re trying to figure out. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m at the Minneapolis Institute of Art with the artist Ann Hamilton. I read something when I was preparing \u2014 it was from The New York Times, it was 1999, which is another century. But, I mean, a long time ago, but it was about \u2014 it was about an installation you did called \u201CMyein.\u201D I don\u2019t even know how to say it myself. Good, I didn\u2019t either. OK, apparently\u2026 It\u2019s Greek. \u2026the Greek root of the word \u201Cmystery.\u201D Anyway, you said something \u2014 well, this is what the Times said, that it was about how we know what we know, and what we blind ourselves to, how the invisible affects us, and how the visible can be veiled, and it\u2019s such a wonderful image. And we don\u2019t have time to go into it, so we\u2019ll just let it sit there. But you said, \u201CI\u2019m thinking\u201D \u2014 this is 1999 \u2014 \u201Cthat I am the American representative, and it\u2019s the eve of the millennium. I want to bring to the surface the questions we should be asking.\u201D That\u2019s so intriguing to me, and, I guess, I\u2019m wondering what questions you think we should be asking now, here, in this young tumultuous, amazing century. Well, how to be together. I mean, isn\u2019t that \u2014 that seems like the biggest question. How to be together. I think that every project, in some ways, it forms by maybe feeling that I have the right question for it. And everything else is kind of debris until I can kind of get to that. Let\u2019s do a little \u2014 let\u2019s have a conversation with you. I don\u2019t know how this is working. Are there some microphones, I believe? Oh, back there, all right. Yes. Many of Krista\u2019s questions and your responses reminded me of a beautiful installation piece of yours that was at MASS MoCA that was in a space that actually looked quite cathedral-like. And then there was a balcony that actually had pews in it of some kind. But I wondered if you could just say more about that piece in the context of this discussion. And what was it called? It was called \u201CCorpus.\u201D It was \u2014 I mean, one, it was a huge, old, industrial space where they had once manufactured capacitors, which store energy and then release it. And it also had been a textile factory, where they had dyed and so \u2014 dyed cloth. And, so \u2026 It had once been \u2014 the room that you\u2019re describing with \u2014 there were many mechanisms that were powered by air that were dropping single sheets of white paper to the ground from, like, 30 feet. And there was a rhythm to that, that you could hear the air, kind of like breath. And a piece of paper might draw your attention because it catches the light. Or a recorded voice raising and lowering from a set of bell-shaped speakers might draw your attention because it pulls you this way in this enormous landscape of this old industrial architecture. And I think that that actually opened my work up for me a lot, and made me, perhaps, helped me understand and articulate a little bit that the piece is not about defining the nature of that experience, but making a condition within which you can wander around, and pay attention to the things that your attention is drawn to. And in that grows the project. I kept thinking when I was reading about how you approach your work, and objects, and placement, and this word, \u201Cattention,\u201D you just used the word \u201Cattention,\u201D of this beautiful definition of prayer by Simone Weil. \u201CAbsolutely unmixed attention is prayer.\u201D That\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ll take that. Was there one more question? I don\u2019t know where the \u2014 I can\u2019t see where the microphone is. Yeah, there\u2019s one right here. OK. Let\u2019s do one more question. Well, for so many of us here who are makers, and teachers, and perhaps also parents, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to how those things inform each other in your life. And also, how you keep the \u201Cmaker\u201D part of you alive with enough time and enough nourishment to not feel like you\u2019re always clawing at the small amount of time or space in your head that you have. I sense something. Tiny bit of desperation, maybe. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just saying, maybe. Well, I think, when my son was born, you know, I think I just had to learn how to make differently, that, you know, it happens in your kitchen, and that it happens \u2014 it just happens differently. And I think there was a process of trusting that just because you can\u2019t be in whatever studio, whatever you call your studio, doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not having a thought. Or insight, or something. And I think it\u2019s that if I conceive of them as being separate, then I will be forever frustrated. But if they\u2019re all one practice, and every project is \u2014 and all the projects are one big project, then I think I \u2014 you know, not that we don\u2019t feel pressed for time in some ways, but then there\u2019s an anxiousness that I can at least allay a little bit. And, you know, sometimes the most important thing you need to do is, like, make the soup. And, in the soup is going to be the project, even though, you know, a kid is sick upstairs, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re making the soup, or whatever. And, you know, I learned \u2014 in teaching, I learn a lot from my students. And I think that it\u2019s reciprocal. It\u2019s like, everything is reciprocal, and everything feeds everything else. You do like this language of being a \u201Cmaker\u201D\u2026 Mm-hmm, very much. \u2026as much or maybe more than being called an artist. And it\u2019s just occurring to me that that language lends itself to the rest of us, too. I mean, being an artist is specialized, but it\u2019s thinking about making as something we all do, each in our own ways, including in our family lives. And there\u2019s so many forms for making. I mean, I\u2019ve said this before, but I\u2019d like to say it again. I love reading the dictionary. And the Oxford English Dictionary has I don\u2019t know many pages devoted to \u201Cto make,\u201D and \u201Cmaking,\u201D and all of its possibilities. And I think that\u2019s like making \u2014 it\u2019s the same as making a list of all the materials that exist in the world that you might transform in some way. It\u2019s like, if you make that list and you take the list of every \u2014 all the possibilities of what \u201Cmaking\u201D is, that can just keep you busy forever. But it also \u2026 And you never even get around to the making. Yeah, but it makes you feel \u2014 it\u2019s like, you see the possibilities. We get blinded to the possibilities that we actually have. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 so, you have these little tricks that you do, you play with yourself to see those. Everybody should try that one. The list? The list, yeah. I\u2019m also pretty intrigued by the idea of reading the dictionary. I never thought of that. Oh, it\u2019s so beautiful. I believe you, I just had never thought of it before. Yeah. Well, and it\u2019s because I \u2014 it\u2019s just as materials, obviously, carry histories of the animal, or the technologies that made them, or where they came from in the earth, that words also carry all of those histories. And although that\u2019s not my area, I \u2014 there\u2019s a reason certain words work, and it\u2019s because of the histories that they carry for us. So lifting that to the surface is \u2014 of recognition is important. And so you, now live in Columbus, again, is that right? In Ohio. Mm-hmm. And, I don\u2019t know, someplace you were talking about \u2014 this is another interview \u2014 \u201CMy life is busy\u2026 I travel a lot, but within that, my life is very domestic.\u201D You\u2019re married, you have a son, you have a cat and a dog. You live in an American neighborhood. And as an artist, as a maker, as a professional maker, you know, you\u2019re exotic. Right? You\u2019re doing things that are very original and out there, and I\u2019m just curious about \u2014 do you \u2014 I wonder how you interact with your neighbors and your ordinary American neighborhood in Ohio. Like, not how \u2026 They don\u2019t think I\u2019m exotic. Right. But how do you \u2014 do you think about talking to them about something like the exhibit you\u2019re doing at the Armory, or the tower in California, or the meditation boat in Laos, or wading through paper and, you know, about how that is connected to this very common longing that\u2019s come through again and again? Or just, you know, who are we now, and what are we to each other? Yeah. Well, I\u2019m really lucky to live someplace where my neighbors are friends. You know, and I\u2019ve been there now a long time. You know, I\u2019ve been there since the early \u201890s. And, so, for instance, down the street are two friends who are both singers. And although their day jobs are different than that, when I started to work on the Armory, I talked to them a lot about voice. And I go hear them. And I learn from them. And they help me trust what I\u2019m doing. And they contribute to it a lot. And I had a most amazing conversation a few nights ago with my neighbor who has just moved in who\u2019s a sophomore, and has moved from China to go to school at OSU, where I teach. And he had been to an art event at the Wexner Center. And it had been a music video \u2014 music concert with live mixing of video. And he \u2014 it was such an intense experience for him, he didn\u2019t know what to do with it. The video? The experience of the performance. And so he came next door, it was like 11 o\u2019clock at night, and he came over to bring me my cat back, who goes and lives in his house when we\u2019re out and it\u2019s cold out. And he came over and he wanted to \u2014 we talked for probably two hours about how he felt. And he didn\u2019t know what to call this thing. And he said, it made me feel things I didn\u2019t know how to process. And it was really scary. And \u2026 It was the effect that this art was having. And is this new \u2014 is this the new art? And it \u2014 he kept talking about how it felt on his skin. How the experience of watching felt on his skin? Yes. He was speaking your language. Yeah. And so he\u2019s a new neighbor. Yeah. And I think that \u2014 I know when you look at the projects when they\u2019re finished, or from afar, they look, sometimes, enormous, and they are in enormous spaces, or they happened over a long period of time. But it\u2019s really one tiny, little step after another. And it\u2019s an associational process. And pretty soon, they arrive like a sweater being knitted into this larger thing. And there\u2019s something actually, kind of, very practical about it, and very mundane, and really ordinary. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a pragmatism in it that I think is really part of how I get there. And on the other hand, I love huge volumes of space, like, being in a gigantic space is something that, you know, it\u2019s like you feel it here. And so, on the one hand, there\u2019s this really practical step, step, step. And on the other hand, it\u2019s like it\u2019s like wanting to fling yourself into something that\u2019s gigantic and will absorb you. And it\u2019s kind of scary. Even transcendent, in a way, that it then transcends all those pragmatic steps along the way. And, together, too, yeah. OK. Ann Hamilton, thank you. Thank you. It\u2019s been really delightful.
