  "fullText": "\u201CIn the folds of this European civilization I was born and shall die, imprisoned, conditioned, depressed, exalted, and inspired. I flew round and round with the zeitgeist, waving my pen and lifting faint voices to explain, expound, and exhort, to see, foresee, and prophesy to the few who could or would listen.\u201D The perhaps most famous line from The Souls of Black Folk: \u201CThe problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.\u201D I mean, first of all, it is prophetic. That is not something we have, as yet, resolved. He saw that. He understood that. And I think that he understood that as a soul crisis for white people, for black people, and for the polis in general. This hour, we celebrate the imprint of W.E.B. Du Bois on the American soul \u2014 and the way his passionate and poetic intelligence might enliven 21st century life on the color line and beyond it. William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born three years after the end of the Civil War, and he died on the eve of the March on Washington. He was the first black man to receive a doctorate from Harvard University. He also co-founded the NAACP. He was a prolific writer on sociology, history, economics, and politics. Du Bois remains a powerful voice for many of the people who gave us the Civil Rights Movement \u2014 and for all of us navigating the still-unfolding, unfinished business of civil rights now. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Here\u2019s the poet Maya Angelou, sharing her love of Du Bois by phone with me, just weeks before her death: Well, I grew up in a little village in Arkansas, during the \u201830s and \u201840s. Everything was segregated. And so the black school which I attended had black teachers and we used books about blacks when we could find them. And of course, W.E.B. Du Bois was one of the great heroes in our world. We were so proud of him. Then I moved out to California to my mother. I got a scholarship to a college. And they said that Dr. Du Bois was coming to speak. I went home and told my mother, I must go, although it\u2019s night, and she must take me. Because they had invited Dr. Du Bois and all those people are white, they don\u2019t know Du Bois is black. I was so sure that they had no idea. And Dr. Du Bois came up the side aisle, against the wall. Fortunately, by 15, I was almost six foot, so I could see, and I thought, \u201COh, my goodness, they\u2019re going to see he\u2019s a negro. Will they get up and walk out?\u201D No, they stood up and applauded. That was over 70 years ago. I have not forgotten it. W.E.B. Du Bois grew up in the relatively tolerant and integrated Northern town of Great Barrington, Massachusetts. It was only when he went south, to Fisk University in Tennessee, that he awakened to what many of us think of as the iconic African-American culture of that time. He discovered what he would call, in 1903, \u201Cthe souls of black folk.\u201D Later, we\u2019ll hear from the poet Elizabeth Alexander about the resonance Du Bois has for her and for new generations. First, esteemed scholar Arnold Rampersad. He\u2019s the author of The Art and Imagination of W.E.B. Du Bois. I\u2019m curious, just to start with \u2014 how and when did you first become aware of W.E.B. Du Bois? I became aware of W.E.B. Du Bois in graduate school, I think. That\u2019s when I first read The Souls of Black Folk, and it \u2014 Du Bois\u2019 book from 1903 \u2014 and it had a very powerful effect on me. And then when I started reading what people had written about Du Bois, I didn\u2019t think that they fully appreciated the depth and breadth of his intelligence, his sensibility, his imagination. Hmm. Now, that was presumptuous of me, but it did give me a kind of push, when I decided I would devote my doctoral dissertation to Du Bois, especially to his creative work. And then later on, expanded that to do a kind of intellectual biography of Du Bois entirely. Yeah. So that\u2019s when I got to know and love Du Bois. And is it right that you grew up in Trinidad and Tobago? I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, yes. Mm-hmm. I came to this country when I was in my mid 20s\u2026 OK. \u2026to go to college. And before then I had never heard of Du Bois. And even in Ohio, where I went to undergraduate school, at that time, between 1965 and 1968, there were no books by African Americans on any syllabus that I was exposed to. I wonder if you could just say a little bit more about \u2014 you talked about how you\u2019d been exposed to so little in the way of black intellectual writing, even through your education. And you read The Souls of Black Folk and you were blown away. Could you say a little bit more about what grabbed you there? You begin to read a book, you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to take you. In this case, The Souls of Black Folk \u2014 in a sense it\u2019s autobiography, but it\u2019s an autobiography that\u2019s close, in some respects, to your own experience of the world as a minority person. And then you see, in the case of The Souls of Black Folk, a mind, a commanding mind, expanding into history, into sociology, but also into psychology and into art. Because he is continually seeing the world both as a scientist and as a lyrical being, and giving voice in a very varied language to the complexity of the world. And you\u2019re seeing yourself and your own personal situation being put in a context you would like to see it put. You see your own pain, your own dilemmas, orchestrated in this marvelous way by an intelligence that you just have to stand back and admire, and that you\u2019re profoundly grateful for because you have not seen it done by anyone else. And that\u2019s why I reread The Souls of Black Folk again and again and it continues to this day to be able to move me as almost \u2014 as few other works can move me. You write a lot about him as a mass of paradoxes, and here\u2019s one way you wrote it: \u201CA product of black and white, poverty and privilege, love and hate, he was of New England and the South \u2014 an alien and an American, a provincial and a cosmopolite, nationalist and communist, Victorian and modern.\u201D I think that there\u2019s something in his kind of multiracial, multicultural heritage, and that line that he walked all of his life \u2014 that actually seems to belong, in some ways, more to our time than it did to his. Do you know what I\u2019m describing? That \u2026 Oh, yes. I do know what you are describing and I think you\u2019re quite right that, in many respects, his dilemma, his agenda, his passions, his sensibility \u2014 all of those things are very much at home in our world. But I think that you can turn your back on him only if you are determined to turn your back on history, on an understanding of the past. And also on a mind, his, that seized on the problem of blackness in America, the problem of race in America and in the modern world. Because he did say, famously, that \u201Cthe problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.\u201D Right. So he had a grasp of the real world in front of him, and he anticipated our own time. No doubt about that. There\u2019s this wonderful passage. It\u2019s almost \u2014 you get the feeling \u2014 this is in his chapter called \u201COn the Training of Black Men.\u201D You get this sense that the life of the mind was \u2014 in some sense, helped him transcend this, as he said, this \u201Cproblem,\u201D being a \u201Cproblem\u201D as a black man. He wrote, \u201CI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not across the color line. I move arm and arm with Balzac and Dumas. I summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will and they come all graciously with no scorn nor condescension.\u201D \u201CSo, wed with truth, I dwell above the veil.\u201D Yes. Yes. \u201CIs this the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia? Are you so afraid, lest peering from this high Pisgah between Philistine and Amelakite we sight the Promised Land?\u201D Oh, yes. His training was really quite remarkable, and his sensibility also remarkable. I mean he did have the soul of a poet, but also the objective capacities of the scientist. But he was trained in history in a very severe sort of way, where the truth could be arrived at, facts were extraordinarily important, the feelings of the historian were to be suppressed. Objectivity was the goal. Come to conclusions, but make sure that those conclusions are not in any way biased by your feelings, your prejudices, whatever. Mm-hmm. And it took him a long time to realize that he couldn\u2019t live that way, that he had to, in fact, draw on his inner emotional resources that were themselves shaped by his life experience, the world about him, his fascination with language \u2014 a much looser, much more creative world that was also demanding but in a very different way. So one of the things that started to intrigue me as I began to, in the first instance, get a sense of how he\u2019s understood academically, is his legacy and his intellect seem to be very secularized, in a lot of the ways he\u2019s written about and interpreted. To me, it also kind of parallels the way King\u2019s very deep and primary grounding in theology and religion was kind of secularized. He became, after his death, a political figure primarily, and a preacher second, and of course the order was reverse. Now, Du Bois obviously had a complicated relationship both to black churches and to white Christianity, to Christianity in general. But it seems to me that to not take seriously, to not use the word \u201Cspiritual\u201D and flesh that out in his life and legacy is to miss a lot of the power of what he did. And let\u2019s just start with when he uses the word \u201Csoul,\u201D \u201Cthe souls of black folk\u201D \u2014 what does he mean by the word \u201Csoul\u201D? Well, that\u2019s a very good question. And it\u2019s perhaps not what a medieval\u2026 Yeah. \u2026penitent would\u2019ve meant by the word. Soul \u2014 it has something to do with consciousness, a sort of psychologically determined consciousness. He\u2019s saying that there is this essence in us that is a combination of a will to the spirit, our experiences, our awareness of ourselves, our awareness of the world. So he talks again and again in The Souls of Black Folk about the dawn of the 20th century, about the business of the soul and about divided souls. Hmm. There being an American soul and an African soul\u2026 Hmm. \u2026within the African American, and how they are at war with one another, because they have different origins, almost, and different goals, and are subjected to different forces, and that the essence of black life is a kind of often heroic, sometimes disastrous struggle to reconcile these two souls. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re experiencing the resonance of W.E.B. Du Bois for contemporary life. I\u2019m with the literary critic and Du Bois biographer Arnold Rampersad. Here\u2019s just the opening lines of The Souls of Black Folk, when he writes, \u201CBetween me and the other world there is an ever unasked question. Unasked by some through feelings of delicacy, by others through the difficulty of rightly framing it. All, nevertheless, flutter around it. They approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eyeing me curiously or compassionately, and then instead of saying directly \u2018How does it feel to be a problem,\u2019 they say \u2018I know an excellent colored man in my town.\u2019 Or \u2018I fought at Mechanicsville.\u2019 Or \u2018Do not these Southern outrages make your blood boil?\u2019 At these I smile or am interested or reduce the boiling to a simmer as the occasion may require. To the real question \u2014 How does it feel to be a problem? \u2014 I answer seldom a word.\u201D Which is really putting the issue of race in an existential context. Yes. I like the rest of the paragraph. Mm-hmm. Or perhaps the bulk of the next paragraph where he talks of \u2026 Would you like to read some of that? Well, I could. I mean, it\u2019s important, really. Yeah. For the first time, he encounters racial prejudice, when a tall newcomer, a girl in his class, refuses to take part in a little game that everyone was playing. \u201CThen it dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that I was different from the others. Or like, mayhap, in heart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast veil. I had, thereafter, no desire to tear down that veil, to creep through. I held all beyond it in common contempt and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great wandering shadows. That sky was bluest when I could beat my mates at examination time or beat them at a foot race or even beat their stringy heads. Alas, with the years, all this fine contempt began to fade, for the worlds I longed for and all their dazzling opportunities were theirs, not mine. With other black boys, the strife was not so fiercely sunny. Their youth shrunk into tasteless sycophancy or into silent hatred of the pale world about them and mocking distrust of everything white; or wasted itself in a bitter cry, \u2018Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?\u2019\u201D And it\u2019s after that burst or whatever you want to call it, that he launches into his discussion of the divided souls, the twin, warring souls of the African American, and how blacks have no true self consciousness, but always see themselves through the eyes\u2026 Yeah. \u2026of whites, basically. And how impossible, almost, that is, to have such a situation and to be able to become fully human, really. Yes. And what is so striking to me about that is how resonant it is. I mean, he was looking at a world post-Civil War, when there had been, in some ways, monumental efforts made to create \u2014 well, certainly to create liberty that wasn\u2019t there before. But he was looking at the very deep failure of that at the same time. The unfinished business of reconstruction. And it seems to me that a century later, having had the Civil Rights Movement, which was really taking off as he died, something that we\u2019re pondering deeply is the unfinished business of civil rights. His analysis of the dilemma facing blacks, when they all have to take into consideration when they come up against racism, when they come up against the entrenched injustice that I think African Americans face on a daily basis \u2014 his analysis was first put forward circa 1900, but, really, it still has enormous resonance\u2026 Yes. \u2026because the basic factors remain the same, really. How do you maintain sanity? How do you become productive? How do you realize your complete potential as a human being when you\u2019re constantly dealing with something that seems almost undefeatable? Yeah. You\u2019ve written biographies of a number of very important African-American figures in American history: Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison \u2014 was it Jackie Robinson? Did you write a biography of Jackie Robinson? Right? I did a biography of Jackie Robinson, yes. I think Arthur Ashe? You were involved in that. Yes. But I wonder, with those figures and other names who come readily to mind in American imaginations, what would you want to name as Du Bois\u2019 distinctive voice and contribution? Well, I think that he was extraordinarily intelligent, but he was also very, very well trained, and he engaged the world as a historian and as a sociologist, always aware of a profound commitment to the lives of his fellow black Americans at a time, say around 1900, when they were in profound distress. So there was always something heroic and persevering and determined to me about his career, his example. Langston Hughes was relentless in his own way in trying to apply his poetic gift to the world around him. But Du Bois was even more dedicated in many respects\u2026 Hmm. \u2026and harder on himself. Pushing, probing at every point, willing to be a pariah, finally, to be unpopular in order to carry the flag of justice to the fore. To make his life be consequential, and not an ornament or an afterthought. That sets him apart, or that set him apart as far as I\u2019m concerned. Yeah. Wonderful. I wanted to ask you \u2014 are you aware of who Walter Brueggemann is? He\u2019s a great scholar of the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. No, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. And he talked about how the prophets are always poets and it\u2019s with poetic language\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026that they rise above the merely political and have something\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026other than merely political impact. And he talked about how \u2026 Absolutely. \u2026 He says that the line we all remember of Martin Luther King is actually a line of poetry. \u201CI have a dream\u201D is actually a line of poetry. Yes. And I just \u2026 A line of Langston Hughes\u2019 poetry. Is it really? It\u2019s a line of Langston Hughes\u2019 poetry? Well, I think Langston Hughes always believed that. I mean \u2026 I didn\u2019t know that. Well, because he had consistently invoked the motif of the dream in his poetry, in his civil rights poetry. So he\u2026 I see. \u2026always felt that Martin Luther King owed him one. I see. Yeah. But that\u2019s another story. Yeah. OK. I probably read Du Bois in college, but just the poetry\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026as you\u2019re saying, of his lyricism, and how that just exalts and gives this power to what he\u2019s saying \u2014 that\u2019s just very unusual. You see, and that was completely \u2014 almost completely left out of accounts by historians\u2026 Yes. \u2026of Du Bois\u2019 life and career. They just did not see it. They\u2019re not trained to respond to poetry. But you\u2019re quite right. I mean, that it is in fact the poetic element in Du Bois that lifts him above only history and mere sociology to make him the influential, profoundly moving presence that he became. Yeah. It\u2019s the poetry that did it. Yeah. I wanted to ask you to read \u2014 I believe it\u2019s the reading from him that you had at the top of the first chapter, chapter one, \u201CThe Making of the Man,\u201D of your biography. The reading that begins\u2026 Oh. \u2026\u201CIn the folds of this European civilization I was born and shall die\u2026\u201D And I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from. You said Du Bois, 1940. Mm-hmm. That would probably be from Dusk of Dawn, his autobiography\u2026 OK. \u2026if it\u2019s 1940. \u201CIn the folds of this European civilization I was born and shall die, imprisoned, conditioned, depressed, exalted, and inspired. Integrally a part of it and yet, much more significant, one of its rejected parts. One who expressed in life and action and made vocal to many, a single whirlpool of social entanglement and inner psychological paradox which always seemed to me more significant for the meaning of the world today than other similar and related problems. Crucified on the vast wheel of time I flew round and round with a zeitgeist, waving my pen and lifting faint voices to explain, expound, and exhort, to see, foresee, and prophesy to the few who could or would listen. Thus, very evidently to me and to others, I did little to create my day or greatly change it but I did exemplify it. And thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men.\u201D You can listen to this show again and share it \u2014 and take a deep dive into the legacy of W.E.B. Du Bois on our website, onbeing.org. Arnold Rampersad is emeritus professor at Stanford University and author of The Art and Imagination of W.E.B. Du Bois. Coming up \u2014 poet Elizabeth Alexander on how Du Bois speaks to new generations and to our navigation of the ever-evolving \u201Ccolor line.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, bringing the life and ideas of W.E.B. Du Bois into relief for the 21st century. He is one of the most celebrated black intellectuals of American and global history. He was born five years after the Emancipation Proclamation and died on the eve of the March on Washington. I discovered the poet Elizabeth Alexander\u2019s reverence for Du Bois in an essay she herself had forgotten \u2014 something she wrote years ago for a book called Saving the Race: Conversations on Du Bois from a Collective Memoir of Souls. Let\u2019s just start by \u2014 I want to hear, if you can recall, your earliest memories of knowing of Du Bois growing up in Washington in the \u201860s and \u201870s. Yes. I think of the Dr. Du Bois \u2014 that was always how he was referred to in my family. And I think that was very important because he was someone to be be respected, that even though African Americans had attained higher education by the time I was a child, I know that I knew he was the first African American to get his Ph.D. from Harvard University, that it was an extraordinary thing to have become educated in the way that he did, so that we ought to give him that title. And later on, I learned \u2014 and there are a number of African-American elders of a generation for whom only the letters of their names are what we know. \u201CW.E.B.\u201D Mm-hmm. That was strategic, a way that he could not be called William or Bill. That someone would have to call him \u201Cboy\u201D or call him Dr. Du Bois. It forced the issue of his stature. And I think that that interested me a great deal. And I remember learning that when I was probably a young teenager. I didn\u2019t read The Souls of Black Folk until I was in college. And I remember very much reading it for the first time, sophomore year with Professor Michael Cooke in a big survey course on African-American literature. It was a graduate course, and at that time, the only place that Du Bois was taught alongside Booker T. Washington and other greats of the tradition. And I remember thinking, \u201COh, not only is he a great man, he\u2019s a beautiful writer.\u201D And how that felt like such a gift that these important ideas came forward to us in language that was unforgettable. Yeah, and I think that I went into this this project of investigating him \u2014 well let me just read \u2014 here\u2019s the Wikipedia entry\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026about W.E.B. Du Bois. \u201CW.E.B. Du Bois was an American sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author and editor. After graduating from Harvard, where he was the first African American to earn a doctorate, he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University. Du Bois was one of the co-founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \u2014 the NAACP \u2014 in 1909.\u201D So those are his credentials. I started very quickly, as I was reading The Souls of Black Folk, to realize \u2014 I thought at first I was discovering this spiritual legacy of his that\u2019s been lost. But I feel as I\u2019ve traced that more and more, what I\u2019ve discovered is his lyricism and his poetry, and how that is such a distinctive contribution of his. Well, absolutely, and I think that he believed that felicitous, careful language, that when you look at The Souls of Black Folk \u2014 which is a book that I teach and the book that I return to of his millions \u2014 when the Bible is absolutely its antecedent. And when you look at the construction of those sentences, when you look at its rise and fall, that\u2019s what he\u2019s patterning himself on. Right. And I think that the perhaps most famous line from The Souls of Black Folk, \u201CThe problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.\u201D I mean, first of all, it is prophetic. Yes. That is not something we have, as yet, resolved. He saw that. He understood that. And I think that he understood that as a soul crisis for white people, for black people, and for the polis in general. Yes. Because it is. Right. And even there, I feel like, yes, to the extent that anybody who has heard a quote of Du Bois, they may have heard \u201CThe problem with the Twentieth Century is the problem with the color line.\u201D And they heard it as a political statement. I mean, I think it\u2019s memorable\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026perhaps because it has this cadence. Mm-hmm. But also, as you\u2019re saying, what he was talking about was something much bigger than laws or rights. Absolutely. Or legal or social structures. He was talking about the human condition and\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026not just the human condition of people who are not white. No, that\u2019s absolutely true. Yeah. And I think that, in that regard, he makes space for James Baldwin in very, very clears ways, in the way that James Baldwin talks about the race crisis as being really a crisis about the inability to imagine each other, the inability to sit in someone else\u2019s chair, to stand in someone else\u2019s shoes. That is all made possible by Du Bois. I think also, in thinking for today, and going back to Souls, what really, really struck me \u2014 not just because I\u2019m an educator \u2014 but his belief in education. It\u2019s very easy now to say, you must get an education, and education is sacred, and education, in fact, is holy. But when you consider that he is writing in 1903, in the years leading up to 1903, he\u2019s talking to a first generation out of bondage. Yeah. OK, so let\u2019s just kind of situate ourselves in time there. And when he\u2019s talking about what an education can do, what it means, he says \u2014 I marked\u2026 Yes, do, please. \u2026because he says it\u2026 Yeah. \u2026far better than I can. It\u2019s so beautiful. \u201CWe are training not isolated men but a living group of men, nay, a group within a group. And the final product of our training must be neither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a man. And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living, not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.\u201D And it goes on in that vein, and then one more quotation here. And I think this is incredible, that he\u2019s talking about the function of the university. He\u2019s not talking about elementary school. He\u2019s imagining the university. And when he writes this, 1903\u2026 Right. \u2026\u201CNo black woman will attain the Ph.D. until 1923.\u201D Mm-hmm. So this is a dream, educating black people. And we just have to, of course, add women where he says men. Educating black people \u2026 And also he was very explicitly aware of women, right? Absolutely. So I think a lot of that use of the word \u201Cman,\u201D for a lot of our forbears of all kinds, they really did mean men, but Du Bois actually had women in mind. I know, yes. So we\u2019ll give him that. Yeah, yeah. But I think sometimes about those folks, and I think no one had done this. Yeah. No one had imagined this. Right. So it\u2019s quite a vision. It\u2019s quite a vision. And you\u2019re right, it speaks in a very kind of uncomfortable way to the kind of discussion we have now about education. And very particularly the kind of discussion we have about inequity in education and race, right? Mm-hmm. That education is the key. But it tends to be framed in terms of equipping people to get the right jobs, right? To make the right kind of living. To join the economy. Mm-hmm. And he so insistently talks about the essential struggle of becoming a full, flourishing human being. And even the way he\u2019s talking \u2014 the way this language you\u2019re quoting\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026the way he talked about education, it\u2019s much deeper and more complicated. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And that work is still there for us to do in our time. It really is. When I teach The Souls of Black Folk \u2014 and we pause, as we must, on perhaps the second most quotable quote: \u201COne ever feels his two-ness, an American, a Negro, two souls warring within one dark body.\u201D It\u2019s thrilling to see students of all kinds of backgrounds talk about double consciousness, talk about their senses of being at Yale, where I teach, and perhaps they feel like their class background is not visible in the classroom. Or perhaps they feel that they are a student from Ghana, and they\u2019re interpolated into a black student body, and how do they feel about that? So you\u2019re saying that this \u2014 his idea of double consciousness actually has many facets, that in that way it feels kind of prophetic? Yes. But what that is in the 21st century and this globalized world is \u2014 has all these different layers. I think it really does. Mm-hmm. And I think that it is \u2014 it seems to me, when I teach this, to be such a gift to these young people. Mm-hmm. To see, oh! There can be more than one thing going on that even feels, in his language, \u201Cwarring,\u201D sometimes, in one body. But it is the work of self\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026to, not necessarily resolve it, but just understand it, work with it. That\u2019s the ongoing work of identity that we do on ourselves. Not necessarily suppressing one so that the other can rise. And we\u2019re just complicated folks. He knew that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with Arnold Rampersad, the late Maya Angelou, and here, the poet Elizabeth Alexander, experiencing the imprint of W.E.B. Du Bois on the American soul. Some of the complicated path of Du Bois\u2019 ideas \u2014 like Communism and Pan-Africanism \u2014 translate imperfectly in modern ears. He also had a famously contentious clash with Booker T. Washington. Washington supported a compromise with white Southern leaders that limited opportunities for Southern Blacks while enhancing basic liberties for the whole. In a sweeping essay in 1903 \u2014 eight years after he had become the first black man with a Harvard Ph.D. \u2014 W.E.B. Du Bois championed the critical need for a black intellectual elite \u2014 the \u201Ctalented tenth.\u201D \u201CThe Negro race, like all races,\u201D he wrote, \u201Cis going to be saved by its exceptional men.\u201D In this little essay you wrote about him years ago, you wrote, in terms of Du Bois, \u201CEven as we may walk around thinking of ourselves as racially complicated people, what does it mean to be in this post-identity era, to stand the ground of our blackness nonetheless? What does it mean to sit with and contemplate our complicated blackness?\u201D And again, I feel like this \u2014 is it a challenge, an edifying challenge to the way we want to talk about race as something we\u2019ve moved beyond? Right. When you talk about that thrill of your \u2014 that your students have, and again, this is not just about \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s speaking to other conditions\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026aside from blackness. He\u2019s also speaking to whiteness, and also what whiteness\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026is going to be 50 years from now. Yes. Yes. I feel like, especially\u00A0\u2014 and it\u2019s intensified since Barack Obama was elected president\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026we have these things that happen, like, let\u2019s say, the shooting of Trayvon Martin. And every time something like that happens, we then end up wringing our hands about how we still don\u2019t know how to talk about this. But I feel like what Du Bois is saying is, talk about it in a complicated, reflective, contemplative way that\u2019s about being human. Absolutely. And I think that also that\u2019s what The Souls of Black Folk, as a book, as a text, that that\u2019s what it exemplifies. And it\u2019s a tiny book. It\u2019s a little, little book. Tiny, little beautiful book. But I think, in the end, perhaps for me, one of the things that wins is the culture argument, and that a people is not a people unless its culture is recognized. And that culture is one of the ways that we express our humanity. Mm-hmm. So, when he says, \u201CI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not.\u201D Yeah. I have always loved that line. First of all, because it\u2019s a line of perfect iambic pentameter, you will note. So I feel that what he\u2019s saying is, \u201CHey, Shakespeare, I can do what you did.\u201D Yeah. I\u2019m speaking your language. Mm-hmm. And, it is perfectly calm. He\u2019s saying we stand on the same timeline. We are, in his phrase, \u201Ccoworkers in the kingdom of culture.\u201D Yeah. And, given that again that struggle in the academy, in curricula, everywhere, is still not complete. We really need that argument from him that just says Shakespeare, Du Bois \u2014 there they sit next to each other. Mm-hmm. Read them. So, one of the \u2014 it was actually challenging to enter this exploration of Du Bois. Mm-hmm. And I guess, to me, that speaks to the fact that what you\u2019re describing, which is a fuller sense of this grappling that we have to do with all that the sides of ourselves, this collage, I do feel like that\u2019s something the 20th century kind of thought it could maybe tame or compartmentalize, that we could make it more rational. Hm. That\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t know if this answers your question, but my 10th-grade son just wrote a paper for his \u2014 at his wonderful school comparing Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. Oh, really? Yeah. That\u2019s so interesting, yeah. Yeah. It was \u2014 he\u2019s excited that I\u2019m here. Yeah, \u2018cause they had quite a tempestuous \u2014 tumultuous relationship. Well\u2026 Yeah, anyway, that\u2019s another whole story. And you see that what Washington was saying was, look, we\u2019ve got a whole lot of black people who need to work, and they are not all going to write beautiful books and be college professors. So where, I guess, for me, at the end of the day, Du Bois wins \u2014 although it\u2019s a crude \u2014 you need all these different ideas\u2026 Yeah. \u2026his idea of the talented tenth, that language, it makes me very uncomfortable. Right. And that is one of the controversial \u2014 we haven\u2019t actually gotten into that. Just say a little bit, briefly, about what the talented \u2014 that idea was of his. Well, that idea was that a race, a people, will not be led by everyone moving together, that, he says, it will be, literally, the tenth of a population that, armed with fine education, armed with opportunity, will lead the people forward. Mm-hmm. So who are those people? How do you get into the talented tenth? Yeah. Who chooses? Who designates? Why a tenth? I mean, what about the class implications of that? It\u2019s a very, very discomfiting idea. But I do think that what\u2019s true in that idea is that, in fact, even within egalitarian movements, even within collective movements, attention is focused on leaders\u2026 Yeah. \u2026on spokespeople. Yeah. So there are all kinds of important questions about how grassroots movements are organized, how decisions are made. But I believe the fact of the matter is that you don\u2019t see every face moving forward at once. Yeah. And also that not everybody wants to\u2026 Right. Exactly. Right. We act like\u2026 \u2026lead a movement. \u2026everyone needs \u2014 wants and needs to be a leader and it\u2019s not true. And it\u2019s not the way the world works. It\u2019s not true. So \u2026 It\u2019s stressful being a leader. Yes. But I think Du Bois had absolutely zero anxiety about his own status and\u2026 Yes. \u2026populist eliteness. Mm-hmm. If that is a thing. Mm-hmm. He had no anxiety about being a total elite, but at the same time, when you look at all the people he educated, all the lynchings he protested, all of the words he wrote, all that he gave to millions and millions and millions of people, the tools he gave people \u2014 I feel like, OK, if you\u2019re that kind of elite, that\u2019s OK with me. Mm-hmm. I just love that your son is doing this paper on \u2014 so did you discover him discovering Du Bois, or did he already know about him? He had heard of Du Bois and Washington from me. My mother\u2019s a historian. So these were not unfamiliar names. But he had not read. Mm-hmm. And I think his experience was to find all of these ideas really fresh and compelling. And he was really interested in the idea that there always \u2014 you know, Malcolm and Martin, that there always\u2026 Yeah. \u2026need to be more than one idea for people to move forward. Mm-hmm. He found that very, very relevant. So, more than Malcolm and Martin, that it\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, exactly. \u2026larger landscape. Exactly. Interesting. What else? What have I not asked you about? What have you not asked me about? Well, I was very happy to rediscover\u2026 This lovely essay you wrote? \u2026this lovely essay that I forgot that I wrote! Well, I guess I don\u2019t know. I could read something. Yes, I\u2019d love for you to read something that\u2019s meaningful. Yeah, he\u2019s led me to so much thinking. He\u2019s led me to aspire to write better. I mean, these are just sort of very personal things. His productivity has made me hesitate less and try to put more out there, because I think that one of the tragedies of racism as it has affected intellectuals and learning is that we\u2019ve had such limited opportunities and so many of our ideas are so quickly shot down that to see a Du Bois who just said, \u201CI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to write something again tomorrow.\u201D Who just keeps doing it. Yeah. And that was a really, really important example. But you started us off with this idea of the interior, the profound interior work of who we are. Mm-hmm. And that phrase, \u201Cthe souls of black folk.\u201D What are our souls? What do they look like? What are we concerned with? Do they all belong to one thing? So, here I say, \u201CHow do we teach our children to be aware, to question, to be tolerant, to be resilient and righteous? How do we nurture their brilliance and bravery? For those of us whose day-to-day experiences are racialized, we nonetheless all have dream space, private space. I don\u2019t think that that space is raceless, or that it is without markers of identity. But I do think it\u2019s a space where those markers are rich, complicated, and not always resolved.\u201D And so, that\u2019s what I wrote, inspired by Du Bois, and I think that that\u2019s not an individualizing wish. Yeah. That\u2019s about, how can we do that work and then come together in our fullness? That\u2019s 21st-century work. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Elizabeth Alexander is the Thomas E. Donnelley Professor of African American Studies at Yale University. Her books include Crave Radiance and her memoir, The Light of the World. She was the fourth poet in history to contribute to a presidential inauguration \u2014 that of Barack Obama in 2009. W.E.B. Du Bois died on August 27, 1963 at the age of 95. He died in Ghana, a center of pan-Africanist energies and ambition in that era. And that is where Maya Angelou finally met him in person. Mrs. Du Bois was a friend of mine when I lived in Ghana. And she had invited me and my husband to come for lunch to their house. And we went there, and she came out into the living room and said, \u201CI\u2019m sorry, he\u2019s not really feeling very well. He won\u2019t be coming out to lunch, but you may come in and say hello.\u201D So I went in with my husband and I told Dr. Du Bois I was afraid the white people were going to find out that he was a negro. And he laughed at that and that was very nice. And we went back into the dining room and had lunch and we left. And Dr. Du Bois died I think that same day. How would you want him to be remembered? Oh. And not just remembered, how do you think that his legacy \u2026 As one of the great thinkers. For a black man at that time, and to teach and to learn and to study under those circumstances when people were being lynched, what Dr. Du Bois showed is that he had enormous courage. I would encourage young men and women, black and white and Asian and Spanish-speaking and all, to look at Dr. Du Bois and realize that courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can\u2019t practice any other virtue consistently. You can\u2019t be consistently fair or kind or generous or forgiving \u2014 any of those without courage. I had this phone call with the great writer Maya Angelou three weeks before her death. You can listen again or share this show on W.E.B. Du Bois through our website, onbeing.org. You can also stream on your phone through our new iPhone and Android app. This show is part of a larger, rich exploration of W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 ideas and legacy, and it has been exhilarating and revelatory to create. I encourage you to listen to my in-depth, unedited interviews with Arnold Rampersad and Elizabeth Alexander, as well as a wonderful conversation I had with the archeologist Whitney Battle-Baptiste, who excavated artifacts at the Du Bois homesite in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. You\u2019ll also find photographs and letters we\u2019ve selected from Du Bois himself, including his correspondence with figures such as Gandhi and Einstein; and we\u2019ll post a few of his famous essays, including \u201CThe Talented Tenth.\u201D Again, all that at onbeing.org."
