  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, we remember legendary interviewer Studs Terkel, who chronicled decades of ordinary life and tumultuous change in American culture, until his recent passing at the age of 96. I sat down with Studs Terkel at his Chicago home a few years ago and drew out his wisdom and warmth on large existential themes of life and death. A lifelong agnostic, Studs Terkel also shared his thoughts on religion as he\u2019d observed it in his conversation partners, in our culture, and in his own encounters with loss and mortality. I happen to be an agnostic. You know what an agnostic is, don\u2019t you? A cowardly atheist. I, myself, don\u2019t believe in any afterlife. I do believe in this life, and what you do in this life is what it\u2019s all about. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. He was called the man who interviews America, a legendary character. This hour, we explore the late Studs Terkel\u2019s accumulated wisdom on the big questions of life, loss, and mortality. A contented agnostic, he believed that taking death seriously means taking life seriously. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CStuds Terkel on Life, Faith, and Death.\u201D Studs Terkel was best known as a Chicago radio personality. He was also a playwright, a sportscaster, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. On air and in writing, he chronicled ordinary life and tumultuous change in American culture. He had a deep knowledge of music and the arts, history and politics. Studs Terkel also had a singular gift for inviting others to give voice to their lives, especially what they know and do well. This morning, we have as our guest the distinguished young American writer \u2014 I was about to say novelist, but I realize now his fields are \u2014 include more than the novel, Gore Vidal. Mr. Vidal \u2026 David Hockney is without a doubt, the most celebrated of all British painters living today, perhaps of the century. I\u2019m seated in the gracious apartment of Madame Simone de Beauvoir, 11 bis rue Schoelcher in Paris. I see we\u2019re surrounded by books, typewriter writings \u2026 Mahalia Jackson, my guest this morning. Mahalia, I\u2019m thinking about you and this song, and I\u2019ve known you since about 1946. That\u2019d be about 17 years we\u2019ve known one another, Mahalia. That\u2019s right. I think about this song \u2026 Arthur Miller, distinguished American playwright, memoirist and, for that matter, president of Pen, the international writers congress \u2026 But now and then, someone comes along \u2014 we\u2019re talking about technology, electronics, music \u2014 but someone comes along who\u2019s an original, and Laurie Anderson is definitely an original. When I interviewed Studs Terkel at his home in Chicago, in 2004, he was in recovery from a serious fall. His famous voice was a bit weaker than it use to be, but as full of passion as ever. We met in his dayroom, which was overflowing with books, old and new, many of them written by people he\u2019d interviewed. In one of his most beloved books, Working, Studs Terkel drew Americans out on how they spend their days. So I began our conversation by asking how he\u2019d come to understand the humanizing power of an interview and what was it in his approach, I wondered, that allowed such a range of people not only to open up in his presence, but to achieve an honesty, even a wisdom they had scarcely known in themselves? You got to start in the beginning. History. The publisher happened to catch some of my interviews of different people. These were known people, like Bertrand Russell or Brando. And he said, \u2018How about you doing a book about ordinary people and their lives?\u2019 Because he\u2019d just published a book about China, what happened after the Mao revolution. And he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do one about an American village, Chicago, in the middle of its own revolution,\u2019 early \u201960s, cybernetics and civil rights, the anti-war, the various things. That\u2019s how it began. The ordinary, non-celebrated people. Celebrities, by and large, are a pain in the ass, you know. No, they are because, you know, they say the same things. Right. And they\u2019ve said it too many times. Yeah. They had to push the movie they\u2019re in and push the book they\u2019re in. So that means nothing at all. Now, why\u2019d I choose these people, these certain kinds of people? Now, this applies to all the books. Well, they\u2019re not ordinary people. That is they are, and they\u2019re not. Right. So talk to me about what it is that happens in a conversation when it is really special. There\u2019s no one way. For example, this is my very first book, I was visiting a housing project, and it was mixed. Now, back in the early days, you know, housing projects were quite good, you know, very good, replacing tenements and shacks. And so this woman I\u2019m visiting, and I don\u2019t recall if she\u2019s white or black, she was light skinned. She was very pretty, I know that, skinny, about four little kids running around. They\u2019re excited \u2014 mama\u2019s got this thing in front of her. She was never interviewed before. The tape recorder itself was still fairly new. And she\u2019s talking to me. And as she talks, I talk, too, you know. And we become friendly like. And I said something that either angered her or made her feel good, I forget. And then we finished the interview, and I feel kind of good. I got a hunch there\u2019s something here. I don\u2019t know what. I just feel kind of good. But the big thing is those kids, those five-, six-year-old kids jumping around the house. They want to hear mommy\u2019s voice. They know it plays back. And I said, \u2018You be quiet now. Now, don\u2019t jump around so much. You be quiet, and I\u2019ll play it back for you.\u2019 And so I\u2019m playing back the voice that she herself never heard before. She never heard herself talking, or in this case, thinking as well as talking. And suddenly she said something on the microphone. She heard, as the kids are dancing around, and she puts her hand to her mouth and \u201COh, my God.\u201D And I said, \u201CWhat?\u201D And she says, \u201CI never knew I felt that way before.\u201D Well, that\u2019s a great moment. She\u2019s saying, \u201CI never knew I felt that way before.\u201D It\u2019s suddenly a discovery she\u2019s made as well as I\u2019m making one. So it\u2019s as though we\u2019re both on a journey in a way. You might say we\u2019re both on a sort of journey. And do you think that the presence of another person, of you, the conversation partner, makes that kind of discovery possible? Well, it would depend who the other person is. Not is, we\u2019re all basically human. What the person has in mind, is it to make the 5:00 news? Is it to say to a mother whose child is dying in her arms, there was a slum fire, \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 you know? I\u2019m giving you a horrible example, of course, but it depends what the purpose is. My purpose: What is it makes people tick? Studs Terkel, who recently passed away at the age of 96. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. This hour, we\u2019re exploring Studs Terkel\u2019s collected wisdom on faith, life, and death. I interviewed him in 2004 at his Chicago home. In 2001, Studs Terkel had published the one book he said he never thought he\u2019d write, an oral history of death. He called it Will The Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith. Characteristically, he spoke with people from all walks of American culture \u2014 doctors, firemen, policemen, gang members, social activists, musicians. Death is not a subject that comes easily, and Studs Terkel found that when given a chance to reflect, most people didn\u2019t experience it as a one-time encounter at the end of life. As he asked people to reflect on the experience of death in their lives, story upon story emerged. They described the deaths of co-workers and neighbors and people close to them, of their own brushes with mortality, of the questions of meaning such experiences always seem to raise. When Studs Terkel began to research that project, he was 86 years old. He had survived a quintuple bypass, and as he put it, \u201Cother medical adventures.\u201D And then Ida, his wife of 60 years, died. I asked Studs Terkel whether her death drove that project forward. Well, I don\u2019t know how to answer that. I mean, did her dying play a role in writing the book? I\u2019m sure it did to some extent, because it was 60 years. We were married 60 years. Well, as you know, she looked quite young, you know. It wasn\u2019t that, the way she felt. \u2018Why do I still feel like a girl?\u2019 you know. And so a couple of days before she died, our neighbors across the way, Laura Watson, looked and she sees this girl in, what do they call it, denim things, the Levis, you know. Jeans? Yeah. Sees this girl with a daisy in her hair, plucking the weeds out of the garden. \u2018Who\u2019s that girl? Oh, my God, it\u2019s Ida,\u2019 you know, who was 87 at the time. Well, in any event, did that play a role? It\u2019s hard to answer. Well, that was a book that was a revelation to me as well. Remember that I\u2019ve hit various aspects \u2014 the Great American Depression, history, World War II, working, jobs people do, race, black and white, growing old aged us, all variety of aspects. What haven\u2019t we touched along the line? Death. How do you talk about death? And then my wife died. It hit me. Of course, I\u2019d play a lot of folk music and other stuff. Among them was \u201CWill the Circle Be Unbroken.\u201D And \u201CWill the Circle Be Unbroken,\u201D as you know, is a very familiar folk tune the Carter Family sang, although others wrote it, you know. That song, of course, deals with mortality, immortality, and family. Family, of course \u2014 will the circle be unbroken? And the inference is, no, it will not be, bad English, unbroken. And that\u2019s more or less how it came about. One of the people who I recall most vividly from Will the Circle Be Unbroken? was the man who\u2019d spent years on death row on false \u2014 Oh, I just got a letter from him the other day, Delbert Tibbs. Well, and I think, yeah, Delbert Tibbs. He was one of the most articulate and wise \u2014 Delbert Tibbs. I meet him \u2014 how did I meet him? Yeah. How did you find him? Through friends, friends. There\u2019s a committee to fight the death penalty, and Rob Warden is one of the guys I know. He says, \u2018You got to meet this guy, Delbert Tibbs,\u2019 who\u2019s now being freed, because he was obviously innocent, the DNA, everything else. But he\u2019s a black guy, hitting the road. He likes to hit the road a lot, who by the way, reads scripture a lot. He\u2019s religious, but he\u2019s also a skeptic. And he\u2019s eclectically religious \u2026 He\u2019s very eclectic. \u2026 to use your word, yeah. He brushes up on the Qur\u2019an and the Talmud. Yeah, the Buddha. But mostly, his articulateness \u2014 not his articulateness, his \u2014 the sense of goodness about him, doesn\u2019t \u2014 he looks like your sharpie. He looks perfect, you know? Skinny, moustache, hot shot. But precisely the opposite, you see. Well, you found him quite moving. Here\u2019s a passage from Studs Terkel\u2019s book Will the Circle Be Unbroken? It\u2019s an excerpt of his interview with the former death row inmate Delbert Tibbs. Tibbs murder conviction was overturned for lack of evidence, but only after he had spent two years on Florida\u2019s death row. When I meet people now, if they try to make a big deal about me having been on death row, I sometimes gently remind them that we\u2019re all on death row. The difference is that here the state\u2019s going to do it, and at some point you\u2019re going to know the date and the hour, but that\u2019s the only difference. I believe life is endless. We can\u2019t talk about life without talking about death. We can\u2019t talk about death without talking about life. I was listening to the Dalai Lama. I read his autobiography, and he says that Buddhists often meditate on death. That\u2019s total anathema to the Western mind, right? I think it has something to do with Greek culture, with its bifurcation of existence \u2014 this is life and this is death. I learned to meditate before I went to death row. That\u2019s one of the things that helped me get through, but it was very difficult. What I\u2019ve discovered is all of the holy books are marvelous, absolutely so, including the Bible. The Bible has the most beautiful language of any book I\u2019ve ever read, not to mention the fact that there\u2019s something there. God is there. But I really do believe he\u2019s hidden. I believe the Jewish mystics who went into the Kabbalah know that. The Bhagavad Gita is the bible to 300 million Indians and others who are not Indians. Thoreau and Emerson read it. Krishna says there never was a time when you and I did not exist, and there will never be a time when we cease to be. He said, \u2018This body wears out, like garments, and when a garment wears out, you take it off and you lay it down and you pick up another one and put it on.\u2019 One of the terrible things about executions is to jump people off into the universe like that. I think for a soul to be wrenched from the body is for the soul to be in anger and in pain and in hatred. I believe it impacts negatively on our world, that probably a lot of the calamities that happen are a result of that sort of thing. I mourn for the whole world, because it\u2019s such a horrible place so often. From Studs Terkel\u2019s interview with former death row inmate Delbert Tibbs, quoted in his book Will the Circle Be Unbroken? So, you know, one thing that is very striking that I didn\u2019t expect is that \u2014 your book about death, it\u2019s really a very religious book. Religious book? Yes. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of religion in it, all the way through it. I mean, did you know that, that those themes would be so prominent when you started it? Well, I knew religion would play a role in it when I \u2014 to be fair, I happen to be an agnostic. You know what an agnostic is, don\u2019t you? Oh, yeah. A cowardly atheist. And I\u2019m an agnostic. But religion \u2014 well, you know who the most religious people in the country are? Black people, by far. Do you know who Gary Wills is? Uh-huh. Gary Wills wrote \u2014 one of his books is one of the least known. It\u2019s called Under God: Religion and America. And it\u2019s mostly \u2014 well, it\u2019s about African-Americans and the church. My friend who died recently, Vernon Jarrett, was a black journalist. And Vern is nonreligious, but he felt the importance of religion when his son died. And he thought how important it was, that church, with all the ritual, with all the hours, it was Episcopalian, black Episcopalian, but it was as long as a Catholic ceremony. High Church, probably. Yeah, is was High Church. Anglo-Catholic, yeah. And it was forever ever and ever. But it gave him solace. So in that sense, without being philosophical, in that sense, the word is \u201Cfaith.\u201D You\u2019ve got faith. In other words, faith and religion are one and entwined so often. Well, I have faith my ball team is going to win. I have faith we\u2019ll win that lottery. But mostly tied up with God or with religion, faith, in that sense. And so religion played a tremendous role in the book. Well, it had to. It\u2019s hard to separate the two. Right. I think what your book chronicles is actually the way people live with religious ideas. And it\u2019s so much about asking questions, right, rather than having answers. That\u2019s right. But it\u2019s woven all the way through these people\u2019s reflections. It\u2019s all through it. In fact, I mentioned Vern. He says \u2014 Vern Jarrett \u2014 he said, \u2018I never dreamed I\u2019d want to be in that number when the saints go marching in,\u2019 and that music in the background. And he\u2019s, \u2018And yet I needed that,\u2019 you see? \u2018I needed that.\u2019 And so the expression of religion, in the true sense of faith, belief \u2014 since science and medicine said no, despite all the advances, the last stage of cancer, no, there\u2019s something. The late Studs Terkel. This reading comes from Studs Terkel\u2019s interview about death and faith with his friend, the late Vernon Jarrett, a former Chicago Tribune columnist. It is in Vernon Jarrett\u2019s words. I took a vow at my father\u2019s coffin that I had to do something with my life as a perpetuation of his. That\u2019s what I think really counts the most. I\u2019m doing the same thing with my son. Much of what I do is on behalf of my son. I do a lot of volunteer stuff with kids, and it\u2019s really in his memory. I wish I were wrong about my doubts, that I\u2019d never, never, never see my son again. I have a tombstone. I want my name on it. I want to be buried next to my son. There\u2019s an old black spiritual that says, \u201CThis little light of mine, I\u2019m going to let it shine.\u201D Right now. Since we don\u2019t know the truth about any of this, you better let your light shine right now. From Studs Terkel\u2019s book Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith. We\u2019ve reprinted the entire interviews with Vernon Jarrett and Delbert Tibbs, as well as conversations Studs Terkel had with a Hiroshima survivor, writer Kurt Vonnegut, and the actress Uta Hagen. Read them on our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. Studs Terkel\u2019s passing gave us a chance to remember our time with this iconic American figure. For one of my producers, it was the sip of whiskey he didn\u2019t drink with him. You can read Trent\u2019s recollection on our blog, SOF Observed. For me, it was a chance to listen to that original conversation in Studs Terkel\u2019s Chicago home, nearly four years ago. He was 92 then, but he still had the same energy, warmth, and curiosity that he had brought to the many interviews he conducted over the years. We wanted to share this complete unedited exchange with you. Download an MP3 of that full conversation and the program you\u2019re listening to now. They\u2019re both free. Get them on our Web site, podcast, and e-mail newsletter, all at speakingoffaith.org. And after a short break, more of Studs Terkel\u2019s reflections on how thinking about death means thinking about life. Also, his thoughts on how the idea of death changed in our culture and for our children during his lifetime that spanned nearly a century. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, we remember, Studs Terkel, who died recently at the age of 96. I sat down with him in his Chicago home when he was 92 and drew out his wisdom and warmth on the large existential themes of faith, life, and death. Studs Terkel was a renowned conversationalist, a playwright, disc jockey, and sportscaster. He was best known as a Chicago radio personality, and for his award-winning books that chronicle ordinary life and tumultuous change in the 20th-century world. Here\u2019s Studs Terkel in 1962, introducing an interview taped in Wales with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. I\u2019m seated in a very delightful room facing the mountains and the scene is so peaceful. I hope my pronunciation of the Welsh city is right, Penrhyndeudraeth. On this very lovely and peaceful Tuesday morning, I\u2019m seated opposite the distinguished, the eminent British philosopher Lord Bertrand Russell. And, Lord Russell, you\u2019re seated here in front of the fireplace. The scene seems so peaceful, and yet the world outside seems so rife with tension \u2014 East, West, one accusing the other of being the villain of the peace and proclaiming himself the hero. Let me ask you a leading question, Lord Russell. On which side are you in this nuclear contest? Lord BERTRAND RUSSELL: I\u2019m not on either side. I think the contest is folly, and what I \u2026 Studs Terkel continued to interview and write prolifically well into his 10th decade. He published four books in his 90s. The first, Hope Dies Last, was about people he called crazy in a celestial way, who sacrifice themselves physically and often economically for the good of others. His final two works included a memoir and P.S.: Further Thoughts from a Lifetime of Listening, which is just being published this month. In our conversation, I drew Studs Terkel out primarily on the themes of his 2001 book, which he called an oral history of death. He called that work Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith. Studs Terkel carefully distinguished between the words \u201Creligion\u201D and \u201Cfaith,\u201D and told me about the complex relationship he had to both in his life. Faith is used, of course, in phony terms. There was a movie years ago called The Faith Healer. And, now, faith healers, who are con artists, we know that, play upon the superstitions of people, religion as the faint hopes of people. That\u2019s The Faith Healer. At the same time, someone will tell you that faith healers have their own kind of an effect sometimes. But religion and \u2014 see, the word \u201Cfaith,\u201D your series is called Faith. This book happens to fit right into it, because it\u2019s all about faith. And there are people who are nonreligious here and there. Kurt Vonnegut is in the book. Yeah. I\u2019ve just been reading his books, and I was so happy to see him in there. He\u2019s called a secular humanist. Well, to him it\u2019s another thing entirely. To him it\u2019s the big sleep. But you wrote in the prologue to the book, you wrote, \u201CEverything about this book became unexpectedly for me a journey into long-suppressed memories and all sorts of ambivalences in feeling of which I wasn\u2019t aware.\u201D Tell me about some of those ambivalences of feeling. I don\u2019t know how to describe that. Right now, see, I got this accident that changed my whole life, obviously, see? Before, I\u2019d describe myself as an elderly man of some vigor. Now I\u2019m just an old, old man, you see? And I\u2019m 92. That\u2019s a pretty long \u2026 That\u2019s impressive. \u2026 and a rather fruitful life \u2014 a number of books, documentaries, and programs. It\u2019s pretty full. So I don\u2019t \u2014 and I\u2019m not lying about this \u2014 I don\u2019t feel that. In fact, after the accident occurred, and I was in pretty bad shape, and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t mind kicking off. I\u2019d like to finish this book. And so if I were to die in my sleep, I wouldn\u2019t feel that lost. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t feel that cheated at this stage of the game. So that\u2019s pretty good.\u2019 Now, how I would have felt 20 years ago is something else. How you would have felt \u2026 But even now \u2026 \u2026 about faith or about writing this book? Even now, why am I here with my caregiver friend, you see? Why am I here if I want \u2014 I don\u2019t want to die. Do I welcome death? Well, of course not. Would I like to live it out to see that? Yeah. Would I like to get better? Sure. Maybe there is a slight, but I can walk around with a cane now. I couldn\u2019t before. Have an appetite, I couldn\u2019t before. At the same time, not the same person. And so I still fight death. I don\u2019t welcome it, no. Do I fear it? That\u2019s a good \u2014 and here\u2019s where the truth and honesty come in. I\u2019ll probably lie, you see. I guess so. Well, in the first place, you have friends. Many of them are younger, and I don\u2019t want \u2014 I\u2019m getting a kick out of things. At the same time, this daily having to have help now and then, yeah, I find humiliating. And so to me death does not mean the same thing as it would to you or to your contemporaries. It\u2019s interesting. As you say, when you set out to do this project, you were asking people to talk about the thing we never talk about, and most of us don\u2019t even like to think about, and I even found it hard to approach reading the book. But when people start talking about death and, as you\u2019re doing now, you actually start talking about life. You see, now you\u2019re coming. You see, you\u2019re pretty good. Now you come to the key to it, of course. How can you separate death from life? So the important thing about death is life. Because it\u2019s the end of something of which you are conscious and aware and, after some slight extent, well, not much, unfortunately, at this moment, you know. Now, what have you done with your life, you see? Now comes the evangelical part. Now comes the preaching part. I\u2019m always doing that, because the books are political by nature, all my books are, because I think life is political. What you do during the time in your life? By the way, it\u2019s a book of many regrets. Things you did not do or perhaps should have done, especially, in many cases, to people close to you. That\u2019s a big one, too. The late Studs Terkel, talking about his book Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith. Something else that people in the book always talk about, or it seems like they all talk about it, even if they\u2019re atheist, is the afterlife, if there is one or if they\u2019ve had to struggle with the question and answer it in some way. You called yourself an agnostic, so what does an agnostic do with the afterlife? Yeah. Well, I don\u2019t know. For me, well, I want to be cremated, of course. Those are my wife\u2019s ashes on the windowsill next to the daisies, which have got to be fresh daisies, which were her favorite flowers. And I want my ashes mixed with hers and spread over Bughouse Square. You got to know what Bughouse Square is. Well, it\u2019s like Hyde Park in London. You\u2019ve heard of that? The famous speech corner, people talk about everything. Oh, the subject often, for years, was India. And now it\u2019s the Middle East, of course. And so it\u2019s Bughouse Square in Chicago. Unfortunately, nobody goes there now. It used to be full of hundreds of people round and about, and there were speeches and they were funny and wonderful. And there were hecklers and the hat was passed. So I\u2019ll have the ashes strewn around Bughouse Square. And if a lawyer tells me that it\u2019s against the ordinance to do it, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s been done. Let them sue the ground, or whatever it is, to get it back.\u2019 Why do you want your ashes scattered there? Well, because I was a kid and used to go there. It\u2019s right next to the Newberry Library, a big library in Chicago. And I used to go to the Newberry Library and read something on a Friday. And then at 6:00, I\u2019d come out and all the guys had gathered soapboxes. And it was very exciting. Yeah. Is that where you learned to love talking, do you think? Well, talking, of course, and heckling back and forth. You asked about the afterlife. Well, I can\u2019t take bets on it. Who\u2019s going to take my bet, you know? I, myself, don\u2019t believe in any afterlife. I do believe in this life, and what you do in this life is what it\u2019s all about. You know, one thing that struck me when I was thinking about \u2014 you were born the year the Titanic went down. Oh, yeah. You know, that\u2019s so vivid. And also, you talk about being a child with asthma. Lots of children have asthma now, but it\u2019s not generally life-threatening. And, you know, the girl next door who died of scarlet fever, it struck me that death maybe, in earlier generations in this country, was closer for a lot of children. Well, you know something? That\u2019s an interesting point. That never came up. I mean, I could have brought that up somewhere in the book. That\u2019s a good point. You see, there\u2019d be signs on the doors, like the girl, the family below us, on the fifth floor or the fourth floor, third floor, and it said \u201CScarlet fever, beware,\u201D you see? And she died of scarlet fever. She was about eight. But this matter of our kids acquainted with the idea of it earlier, and yet we have more and more, thanks to TV and thanks to technology, we have everything. In fact, you see, I have this theory about, nothing unusual about it, there\u2019s always a gun, and often it\u2019s a girl detective, right, holding the gun. But the gun, they shoot as often as the guys do. And so there\u2019s the awareness of that death, which is of utter meaninglessness. But the personal aspects of death, of the neighbor child, you see, that is something else. Yeah. I mean, I was going to ask you if, in your lifetime, death had changed in the way people think about it. You just pointed to how, in fact, we\u2019ve put death all around ourselves again in another form, in fiction. Yeah, that\u2019s true. You see, we make death suddenly have no meaning. And by death having no meaning, life has no meaning. I mean, you can\u2019t separate death and life. Death means the end, that\u2019s it. And as to whether there\u2019s an afterlife or not, that\u2019s for each one to choose. By the way, I don\u2019t mock anybody. I know. I mean, if someone \u2014 so many speaking of afterlives, and you don\u2019t fault them for that, the belief, the need. But the big thing is are kids aware of death, its meaning today? They see more of it, phony, ersatz death. Right now, we see about five shows right now. And the death of who? And so one American knocks out 10 of them. Oral historian and longtime radio personality Studs Terkel, who died recently at the age of 96. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. I sat down with Studs Terkel, at his home in Chicago, in 2004, and spoke with him about the big questions of life, faith, and death. Let me ask you this. You interviewed people who\u2019d encountered death in many different kinds of contexts and circumstances \u2014 in war, through illness, the woman who survived Hiroshima, who was there during the bombing. Tammy. She talked about that that was death without dignity. And I wonder if you found people to speak differently about the meaning of death and life, depending on the circumstance in which they encountered? Well, there again, you see, Tammy, you\u2019re talking about, the Japanese woman who is now a hospital aide, a psychiatric aide working on life. And \u2026 She was a little girl. \u2026 but hers was so overwhelming. Hundreds of thousands all over her. It wasn\u2019t a question of a single death. It was looking for her mother, hoping she could hear that familiar song that her mother sang. Studs Terkel interviewed Tammy Snider in 1997. On August 6th, 1945, the day her hometown of Hiroshima was bombed, she was 10 years old and she was home alone. I\u2019ve been talking to Hideko Tamura, Hideko Tamura Snider now, and One Sunny Day is her memoir, of course, that day being August 6th, 1945. And so here\u2019s this girl searching the through \u2014 looking for \u2014 you\u2019re going to the village and you\u2019re asking, \u2018Is Mrs. Kamiko Tamura here?\u2019 You\u2019re asking people that. By the way, aren\u2019t you \u2014 weren\u2019t you calling out a song, too, that your mother \u2026 Well, I got to the point where I thought I cannot bear this anymore. And then so, of course, the last resort for me was prayer. And I say, \u2018God, please help my mother, because I can\u2019t find her and I cannot help her.\u2019 And every time I called out my mother\u2019s name, I was saying, \u2018Oh, I hope I don\u2019t really find her here. Everybody looks terrible,\u2019 you know. So I started to hum some of the songs that she used to love to sing to me, and I said, you know, \u2018God, please carry this tune, if you could, and comfort her, because I can\u2019t be there. But maybe you could.\u2019 Do you remember one of those? Something like that, you know? I didn\u2019t know you were going to ask me. I just kind of remember. You know, that\u2019s beautiful. And that was one of her most favorite songs she used to sing aloud. So I wanted that song, also, you know, to hum back to her. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can\u2019t talk for others, even though I put forth this book, still can\u2019t talk for others and their feelings about it. But did you hear common themes that surprised you or differences that surprised you? You know, the things that came up again and again that there were echoes of? Well, faith, as you\u2019d think, well, faith, also, could equal desperation, you see? There\u2019s that, too. I say faith. I say, \u2018What\u2019s it called?\u2019 There\u2019s no hope. There\u2019s no hope for that someone who\u2019s so close to you. Well, to someone who\u2019s agnostic, there\u2019s envy of the person who has faith, because at least they have that. That solace. You wish your were, well, the word isn\u2019t innocent, yeah, as innocent \u2014 I was going to say naive. That\u2019s presumptuous of me to say that. OK. But beyond the solace, I mean, I wonder if you changed your way of thinking about faith or if it got larger in any way? Oh, well, did I? Aside from that? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to stick with that for a while. I\u2019m too soon. Also, with my own accident. Did it make you ask any questions about faith that you hadn\u2019t asked before? Oh, yeah. Well, it made me understand. It made me understand the power that it has, whether it\u2019s real or not. But the power that you think it has, it does have that. And you also understand why people are so religious out of despair. Faith comes out of hope. It also comes out of despair. And what about these people you\u2019ve interviewed in Hope Dies Last, people who\u2019ve really given themselves over to good and to helping others? Was faith a theme, an echo in that book? Well, there are certain kinds of people who have put themselves out on the line. Those I call the crazy people, who put themselves out on a line. Some are known, most are not known. But they\u2019re the ones who are out in their way to try to make this a, using the phrase, \u201Ca better world,\u201D which of course causes snicker and a laugh these days, you see? By the way, a good number of them have their own doubts, too. There\u2019s still that feeling that there\u2019s something within people not yet tapped. It\u2019s about possibilities within people, basically. But it\u2019s mostly about life.\u2019 Again. We come back. The book is not about death. A book about death? I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s about life, man.\u2019 I want to read this. This was from Uta Hagen, the actress. She\u2019s not a religious person, I think, from the interview you did with her, but maybe more of the people in that book are. But she does have this definition of faith that creeps in. \u201CFaith, the miracle of creation, is what a human being is capable of communicating. It\u2019s not a private thing; it has to be communicated.\u201D She goes on to say, \u201Cwhich is what I love about art that you pass on. You enlighten people, you make them laugh, you make them cry. These are the things that make our life worth living. To me, that\u2019s art. That\u2019s my religion.\u201D I thought of, actually, when I read that about the work you\u2019ve done and how you\u2019ve spent your life listening and talking and helping people bring these things into words \u2014 turn them into words, and I wondered what you thought of that, those words. Well, that\u2019s wonderful. Of course, quoting Uta Hagen. She was, you know, remember, that\u2019s an actress talking. Not just an actress, a great actress. She\u2019s really talking about art, you see. Right, but she\u2019s talking about communicating writ large. Yeah, and communicating. You see, I open her \u2014 remember, I opened with the aria from Tosca, \u201CVissi d\u2019arte.\u201D You know, when Tosca pleads with this police chief to leave her alone, that her life is for love and art. And art. And the idea is art is long and life is short, you know. That\u2019s a nice ending. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Studs Terkel died on October 31, 2008, at his home in Chicago. He was 96 years old. His final book, P.S.: Further Thoughts from a Lifetime of Listening, has just been published. That book includes transcripts from Studs Terkel\u2019s documentary of Voices from the Great Depression. In it\u2019s preface, he writes this: \u201CThe situation then was not too removed from the one we face today in the matter of joblessness and need. Today, we use euphemisms, instead of depression we say recession, but to the man and woman designated out of work, one is a synonym for the other.\u201D You can read excerpts and hear recordings for Terkel\u2019s oral history on the Great Depression on our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. We\u2019re also looking for fresh thinking and language for talking about the current economic crisis. What has happened and why, not just in terms of financial tools and strategies but in terms of personal conscience and values. And we\u2019re starting a dialogue with wise thinkers in the realms of business, education, philosophy, science, and religion. We\u2019ll be posting these conversations on our staff blog, SOF Observed. Learn more and share your stories at speakingoffaith.org. The senior producer of Speaking of Faith is Mitch Hanley, with producers Colleen Scheck, Shiraz Janjua, and Rob McGinley Myers, with assistance from Amara Hark-Weber. Our online editor is Trent Gilliss, with Web producer Andrew Dayton. Special thanks for this program go to Tony Judge and to the Chicago Historical Society. Kate Moos is the managing producer of Speaking of Faith, and I\u2019m Krista Tippett."
