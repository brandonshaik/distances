  "fullText": "It\u2019s a constant theme these days: Where is technology taking us? Are we heading towards greatness, or just hyperconnected collapse? This challenge, our challenge, was foreseen a century ago by Teilhard de Chardin. A world-renowned paleontologist, he helped verify fossil evidence of human evolution. A Jesuit priest and philosopher, he penned forbidden ideas that seemed mystical at the time but are now coming true \u2014 that humanity would develop capacities for collective, global intelligence; that a meaningful vision of the earth and the universe would have to include, as he put it, \u201Cthe interior as well as the exterior of things; mind as well as matter.\u201D The coming stage of evolution, he said, won\u2019t be driven by physical adaptation but by human consciousness, creativity and spirit. It\u2019s up to us. We visit Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s biographer, and we experience his ideas energizing New York Times Dot Earth blogger Andrew Revkin and evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson. The main thing he said, which is only now becoming back in back in vogue, is that in one sense the origin of man was just another species, but in another sense we were an entirely new evolutionary process, and that made us in some ways as significant as the evolution of life . The whole region of cyberspace, you see there are some people who say Teilhard is the patron saint of the World Wide Web. He somehow had this idea that we will intensify our communication. But what are we doing; what do we do with it? There are the Kurzweils of the world who talked about the singularity when they kind of see the potential for this system to essentially become more powerful than we are. But I think what\u2019s much more powerful right now is this growing capacity to collaboratively create things \u2014 and collaboratively feel things and experience things as well. It\u2019s not just a function of computing power, there\u2019s something else that\u2019s going on. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born France in 1881 and died on Easter Sunday of 1955. He became a Jesuit at a young age. He studied and taught geology and paleontology in Paris, England, and Egypt. Teilhard de Chardin is best known to modern readers for books his religious superiors never allowed him to publish in his lifetime: The Phenomenon of Man; The Divine Milieu. He spent the better part of his professional life in and out of China \u2014 nearly a quarter century \u2014 where he contributed to the discovery and understanding of the famous \u201CHomo Erectus\u201D or Peking Man fossil. Ursula King is Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s biographer \u2014 the author of numerous books about his life, science, and philosophy. How did you discover Teilhard? Well, that\u2019s quite a wonderful story because I was a very keen student and I went to the Sorbonne to do philosophy and theology. My theological lectures came from Jesuit professors, and one of the professors, he had known Teilhard de Chardin and he had tried to publish some of his essays before Teilhard died. Teilhard wasn\u2019t allowed to get things published. Then in 1962, when the Vatican issued documents saying that Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s ideas should not be taught in any Catholic seminary, he \u2026 This was after his books had been published, after is death? It was after his death, but only two or three of his books were out. This was at the beginning. But he was very well known in France. He was very well known. OK. And so this very enterprising, audacious professor, he decided he would give a series of public lectures in Paris on Teilhard de Chardin and that\u2019s how I discovered him. And it was a wonderful experience and he lent me almost the very last essay that Teilhard wrote, called \u201CThe Heart of Matter,\u201D and that contains, in a nutshell, his inner development in how he really discovered this wonderful, you know, the development of the world, the evolution of the cosmos, and the way this really is intertwined with human development and spiritual development. So I think this is also a passage from \u201CHeart of the Matter,\u201D and this also gets at the fact that matter initially in the beginning of his life, you know, matter in its most solid form in terms of how we perceive it, rocks, captivated him. And he grew up, of course, in a mountainous region of France where there were extinct volcanoes. So here \u2026 It\u2019s in the Auvergne. Right. I\u2019m just going to read some of these lines that really struck me. \u201CAt the very beginning of my conscious life in my efforts to attain and grasp the solidity to which my innate demand for plentitude impelled me, I tried above all to capture the essence of matter by looking for it in its most closely defined and concentrated and heaviest forms. Then it was that my newly born attraction to the world of rocks began to produce the beginning of what was to be a permanent broadening of the foundations of my interior life.\u201D And he says, the truth is, that he\u2019s never been able to feel at home even at the peak of his spiritual trajectory unless immersed in an ocean of matter. Right. It\u2019s just so vivid and unusual. Yeah. I mean, he grew up in a volcanic area in Auvergne, so he had this sense. And his father was an amateur scientist who encouraged all his children to do fossil collections. That\u2019s how it really started. He was brought up in a very devout Catholic traditional family. He could have become just a traditional priest without all this, but because his father encouraged them to do this, he had this great curiosity and he was always drawn to the outside. So he was drawn to geology. He became a geologist. He had doubts about it when he was first a young Jesuit \u2014whether really you could do that \u2014 but he did it, and he really devoted his life to it and became an internationally known scientist. But he always had this very deep spiritual vision of things. Right. And it seems to me that the other cathartic experience that then continued to shape him was \u2014 so he became a Jesuit and he became a scientist. And then, in 1914, he went into the trenches of World War I where he worked as a stretcher-bearer. He discovered in that experience \u2014 alongside his sense of the milieu of nature, of matter \u2014 he discovered this whole new human milieu. And I want you to talk to me about how you think that then shaped his vision, including how he then went back into his science and his theology. Right. When he went to war. He didn\u2019t want \u2014 I mean, he had the right and he should have really been an officer and he didn\u2019t want to be an officer. He wanted to be with the ordinary man. He wanted to be just an ordinary soldier. So because he was a priest, he couldn\u2019t fight and be a combatant, so he became a stretcher-bearer. He was with the Tunisian regiment, you see. And this regiment consisted largely of Muslims and had no pastoral care. There was no Muslim chaplain or anything. I didn\u2019t know that, right. Now this is very, very important because he describes very vividly how he brings these dying men, these wounded men, from the front back to the back of the fighting lines to be, you know, attended to. You know, he sees immense suffering of people. And in all this kind of turmoil, he starts writing his essays because he felt he might die any moment. This is in 1914, at the beginning of the war. And in the inward vision, the very first essay he ever wrote was called \u201CCosmic Life.\u201D Right. I have that in front of me. So these essays were collected in a book with the title Writings in Time of War. He starts pulling all of this together, right? His vision as a paleontologist, as a spiritual man, as somebody who\u2019s in the midst of war. \u201CMy starting point is the fundamental initial fact that each one of us is perforce linked by all the material, organic and psychic strands of his being to all that surrounds him.\u201D You know, what strikes me about that is it sounds like something that someone would write in the 21st century, but not in 1914 . That\u2019s a very, very perceptive observation. You see, I often find this. I find people write something today and I think, my goodness, I read this in Teilhard in the \u201920s and \u201930s. Right, right. And this is why he was such a lonely man, why he had a vision that really was so comprehensive and so alive and so forward-going, you know, that it was very unusual in his time. You know, he\u2019d say sometimes, I would love to be a musician, maybe to create a symphony or something, to express the whole music of the universe. I think something that I hadn\u2019t realized until I got into Teilhard was that he was an exact contemporary of Einstein. They died in the same year, in 1955. Right. That he was an paleontologist. He was often in China. He was helping authenticate the remains of the Peking Man fossil. So his science didn\u2019t directly overlap, but he was also there as the theory of relativity was born, as quantum mechanics were born. So there was this whole new view of space, time, and the universe that was unfolding on many spheres, and it\u2019s so clear to me that all of that is there. And yet, he\u2019s taking it to a different place as a theological and spiritual thinker, right? This idea of this cosmic vision. I mean, even the word cosmic, which took on a whole new meaning through science in the 20th century. I mean, when you think about how he used that term, you know, what did he mean when he \u2026 Very early on, you see, very early on, he was also a promoter of the notion of the biosphere. The biosphere, that word, was only created in 1874. Teilhard was \u2026 Teilhard created that word? It was somebody else, right? It\u2019s Swiss. It\u2019s a Swiss paleontologist, Swiss geographer, who created this word and he wrote four volumes which are translated as \u201Cthe face of the earth,\u201D and Teilhard uses that title for an essay in 1922 because he\u2019s suddenly aware that we are not just living in one place in one country, but it\u2019s as you have just said, space and time. We\u2019re living on a globe. We\u2019re living on the whole earth and the earth has a face and a kind of identity, almost physiognomy, like a person. It\u2019s like a cosmic person. And for him, religiously speaking, he sees this cosmic person as the body of Christ. I mean, he sees it really in his own Christian \u2026 Right, and he even used the term \u201Ccosmic Christ.\u201D Yeah. He uses \u201Ccosmic Christ.\u201D He speaks about the cosmic, and he sees us. You see, he speaks about we are but an atom in the universe. And let us all be an atom in the body of Christ, he writes. You see, he\u2019s looking always for something very, very comprehensive, all-embracing, all interconnected. And then after the war, when he had regular discussions with a philosopher friend, quite a famous philosopher, Edouard Le Roy. They met and they discussed all these ideas and they came up together with this notion of the noosphere. Right. It\u2019s first a development. It\u2019s a flowering out and grows out of the biosphere. And it\u2019s n-o-o-s. Noos is the Greek term for mind, right? Right. So the way I understand it, the biosphere is the earth of the layer of living things and the noosphere is really about the layer of thinking beings and, in fact, of consciousness, right, right. And more. Noos, the Greek term of noos, is not our reason. It\u2019s not about analysis. It\u2019s about synthesis, you see. And it\u2019s the self-thinking, yes, but it\u2019s also the thinking that connects us. It\u2019s a fear of specifically human, which he feels is still emerging. We are not fully, how should I say? The human is not fully developed yet. Right. So I want to stop there because it\u2019s evolutionary is how he thinks about it. And that\u2019s the other huge sphere of science that \u2014 the theory of evolution \u2014 that the world is still wrestling with in his lifetime and in some ways in ours. Today, yes. Right. And that he as a Jesuit, of course, this is an intimate struggle that he has. All of his career, he sees evolution as \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s this phrase, \u201Cthe holiness of evolution. God is at work within life.\u201D Yes. And not just that. I mean, as we said, he is working on the fossils of what we call the Peking Man in China. But then, as you just pointed at, he sees evolution happening both on a physical and \u2026 \u2026 a spiritual level. What does he say? Yes, that evolution proceeds toward spirit. And in some way, you have a sense that even as he looks at Peking Man and he sees himself as a 20th-century human looking back at this primitive creature, that he imagines future man looking back and seeing a primitive spirituality. But he imagines this flowering of consciousness, as you just described. It\u2019s evolutionary consciousness. It\u2019s mind-blowing, mind-boggling. I mean, the whole region of cyberspace, you see there some people who say Teilhard is the patron saint of the World Wide Web. He\u2019s foreseen this. He has somehow had this idea that we will intensify our communication, but what are we doing? What do we do with it? That is really the big question and the big choice and option because we have to really create it. One thing that\u2019s very striking is this \u201CMass on the World\u201D that he set in China. Oh, yes. Right. So here you kind of have how he captured much of this in his religious sensibility. \u201CSince I have neither bread nor wine nor altar, I will raise myself beyond the assembles up to the pure majesty of the real itself. I, your priest, will make the whole earth my altar and on it I will offer you all the labors and sufferings of the world.\u201D It\u2019s a wonderful passage, wonderful passage. He speaks in \u201CThe Mass on the World\u201D about The Divine Milieu that is also a concept or an idea and experience that comes from the First World War onward. But how would you describe that, The Divine Milieu? What he meant when he used that term? You know, for me, the milieu in the French sense is the center, but we also use milieu in terms of the environment. It\u2019s both the center. Something comes together like in a diamond, you know, just something captured in one center but then it radiates throughout the entire. God is everywhere, in a sense, hidden, not visible, but somehow reachable. Was it also in the context of \u201CThe Divine Milieu\u201D that he spoke of the human as \u201Cmatter at its most incendiary stage\u201D? Yes, I think you\u2019re right. I think you\u2019re right. That\u2019s a wonderful \u2026 Which is also such a wonderful image. It\u2019s a wonderful phrase. So, you see, I think he has this dynamic awareness from his evolutionary approach, so one could call his spirituality also an evolutionary spirituality, as some people do. And he feels that we are today at a very, very important threshold of immerging into a new phase of humanization, of becoming human, in a different way from the way our forebears were. Right, right. They pull from the future and towards the future. And he\u2019s less and less interested in the past and more and more interested in where are we going, what are we doing with the potential we have, with the imagination, the creativity, the consciousness, the complexification of people thinking together and acting together. What is all this aiming for? Biographer and theologian Ursula King. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today exploring the ideas and the evolutionary spirituality of Teilhard de Chardin, the 20th-century Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher. David Sloan Wilson is one of the people informed by Teilhard\u2019s ideas in the present. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist \u2014 and an atheist. But he admires what religions do right in human societies and he\u2019s committed to applying the insights of evolutionary biology towards social good. He\u2019s working on urban renewal in this spirit in the neighborhoods of Binghamton, New York. The book David Sloan Wilson wrote about that project has a chapter in honor of Teilhard de Chardin, called \u201CWe Are Now Entering the Noosphere.\u201D Teilhard de Chardin is a figure in the last century who you discovered in preparation for a Vatican conference. Had you not heard of him before? Oh, of course, I\u2019d heard of him. Most people who become evolutionists have heard of him, but have they read him? Would they regard his ideas as current? The answer to those questions are, for the most part, no. So I felt the need to read him more closely during the Year of Darwin in preparation for this conference at the Vatican because, of course, Teilhard was a Jesuit priest and a world-famous paleontologist at a time when being a priest and a scientist was not so unusual. What captured you? I mean, what spoke to you in his writings in terms of the work you were doing and the life you were leading a hundred years later? Well, what I discovered to my amazement really was that Teilhard was ahead of his time scientifically, that much of what he was saying actually passed muster from a modern evolutionary perspective. And the main thing he said, which is only now becoming back into vogue, is that in one sense the origin of man was just another species. We were just another primate. But in another sense, we were an entirely new evolutionary process and that made us in some ways as significant as the evolution of life . To translate that into modern terms, our capacity for symbolic thought is something that began, for the most part, with humans. So symbolic thought as a mechanism of inheritance and the enormous diversity of what we do as cultures, as in evolutionary process, it really is a new evolutionary process. Teilhard was correct about that and that amazed me. You know, I would love to read the definition you gave of the noosphere in your book about the neighborhood project. You mention that \u201Cthe word biosphere had already been coined to describe the influence of life on earth and Teilhard adopted the term with pleasure. Now for Teilhard\u2019s own contribution. He asks the reader to imagine excavating layers of soil. Deep down, there is only the physical earth. Closer to the surface, organic materials begin to appear. Then still closer to the surface, human artifacts start to appear. At first they are barely present, such as flakes of stones chipped from rocks to make tools. Then they become more abundant. In the immensity of space and time, the artifacts of human activity spread over the surface of the planet and form a kind of skin, like the skin of life that preceded it. A word is needed for this human skin. The noosphere.\u201D That\u2019s right . But also, I\u2019m not even sure, in that paragraph what you\u2019re saying also is it\u2019s not just our artifacts; it\u2019s thought entering the equation of evolution, right? It\u2019s thought and, by thought, of course, he meant many things. There\u2019s not a one-to-one translation here. Right, right. But I think the salient part is the fact of the phenomenon of symbolic thought. So what that means is, cultural evolution can produce this field of behaviors that enables humans to adapt to certainly all environments. That\u2019s why we spread over the planet and hundreds of ecological niches put us humans in a new environment. And we\u2019ll adapt, but only because we have this flexible system of symbolic thought that enables us to adapt. That\u2019s why it qualifies as a new evolutionary process and why we became the dominant species on earth for better or for worse. And there\u2019s a lot of worse in there. MS. TIPPETT: Right. We could evolve to extinction this way. Right, and you feel like this may be something that Teilhard got wrong or that his view was too optimistic? Well, first let me tell you another thing that he got right and then the one thing that he got wrong. Another thing he talked about was that he called them grains of thought. And what he meant by that is that at first, of course, humans existed in tiny groups and they each had their separate symbolic systems, which were disconnected to each other. Then he imagined these grains of thought coalescing and that corresponds to increasing the scale of society. Indeed, that has happened. Then he thought that his would result in a single global consciousness that he called the Omega Point. Right, the process of evolution reflecting on itself. Now it is true that we have the increasing scale of society all the way to the mega societies of today, but the idea that this was going to result in a single global brain, and especially that there is some inevitability about this, is what\u2019s not quite right. It could happen. It\u2019s within the realm of possibilities, but it is by no means certain. There is such a thing as collapse. And I think one of the reasons that his work does have the spiritual quality is because of the idea that there is an Omega Point and we\u2019re going towards the Omega Point. I think the real situation is that, yes, there\u2019s an Omega Point, but we have to work real hard to get there. And if we don\u2019t get there, then woe is us. One of the things that makes it seem more realistic to me, if you will, is the sense of time he had. I mean, if I think of him looking at the Peking Man fossil and seeing how primitive that seemed to us now, my sense is he might look at us spiritually even now, I mean, just a few generations after him, and still see us as not there yet, still having a long way to go, as you say. But I guess you\u2019re also saying along the way we might extinguish ourselves . Right. Well, there is what Teilhard thought and then there\u2019s what we should be thinking. One of the most amazing things about Teilhard is what he experienced during his lifetime, including World War I as a stretcher-bearer. Right. So he experienced more horror than any of us have or most of us have anyhow. Yet he remained so optimistic and positive spiritually. He had this uncomfortable relationship with the church, you know, the Vatican suppressing him and banishing him to China and depriving him of all sorts of awards that he could have gotten. He bore all of that and still managed to think of Christianity, even though he referred to the Vatican as stroking the whiskers of the tiger . He also thought of Christianity primarily as Christian love and as the leading edge basically of a belief system that was capable of uniting people from all walks of life based upon love. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re any more spiritually advanced today than during Teilhard\u2019s time. I think in some ways, we\u2019ve gone backwards. And when we think of what it means for spirituality to be the leading edge of evolution, we need to understand what spirituality means, what words such as spirit and soul actually mean and why we\u2019re impelled to use them in everyday life. And when we do that, I think we can come up with a very satisfying meaning for them, which need not require a belief in supernatural agents. And so we can speak frankly about having a soul and even our groups having a soul, our cities having a soul, and even the planet having a soul. I mean, that actually can have a straightforward meaning. Any major word is diverse, by the way. I\u2019ve actually studied major words such as altruism and selfishness, and what you find is that there\u2019s a diversity of meanings which actually you can study the diversity of meanings as different species of thought \u2026 Because this is a linguistic biodiversity Yeah, it\u2019s awesome. I mean, I\u2019m telling you. Well, let me just ask you one more question about Teilhard. It seems to me that one of the points he was making was that spirit as he envisioned it, the spirit that evolution is driving towards, I mean, it wasn\u2019t spirituality as a state of, you know, comfort. It was about being able to galvanize for something, as you say, to work for the greater good. Right. And in that sense, you know, when I look at what you\u2019re doing, it kind of seems to me that his thinking is having that effect for you or supporting you in that movement. It definitely is and the way to state that modern evolutionary terms is that evolution only sees action. Whatever goes on in the head is invisible to evolution unless it is manifested in terms of what people do. So if what\u2019s inside your head, if your meaning system does not cause you to act in the right way, then it is not very good as a meaning system. We want a meaning system that causes us to be highly motivated to act and, of course, do the right thing. And in modern life, that needs to be highly respectful of the facts of the world. And then we also need to have values that we\u2019re more aware of than ever before and we must then use those values to consult those facts in order to plan our actions basically in a world that\u2019s increasingly complex and which requires management at a planetary scale.

Coming up, renowned science journalist and environmental blogger Andrew Revkin on the resonance he finds between Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s ideas and the emerging global brain we call the Internet. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, tracing the prescience and wisdom of Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 the 20th-century Jesuit priest, paleontologist, and philosopher. He\u2019s best known for writings he was not allowed to publish in his lifetime \u2014 including The Divine Milieu and The Phenomenon of Man. New York Times Dot Earth blogger Andrew Revkin is an influential voice in spheres where Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s ideas are finding a new resonance \u2014 journalism and science on the environment, and the broader realm of making sense of emerging technology and humanity. In recent years, Andrew Revkin has been playing with Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s notion of the noosphere \u2014 the idea that human activity, invention, and spirit are driving a new stage of evolution. Some scientists are now saying that the force of the human imprint on the planet is giving rise to a new geological age they\u2019re calling the \u201Canthropocene.\u201D There\u2019s also new evidence emerging that the universe, the brain, and the Internet grow in similar ways \u2014 forming organically by connection. How did you discover Teilhard de Chardin? And I\u2019m curious if you first discovered the spiritual Teilhard or the scientific Teilhard. Well, for me, it actually started with Vladimir Vernadsky, who was a Russian geochemist who intersected with Teilhard and others intellectually in the early 20th century. He was the first scientist who really sort of said we were becoming a global geological force. And then he had articulated aspects of this idea of a growing noosphere. And Teilhard and he and others started articulating it in new ways. So I was writing about the whole issue of the growing impact of humans on the planetary system and then I backed into Teilhard. Although then, I realized he intersected with other stuff that I\u2019d been reading and writing about from decades earlier just even before I was a journalist, the work of Ren\u00E9 de Borst, the work of Thomas Berry, and it was just wonderful. So many of these characters I\u2019ve ended up focusing on are at the intersection of spiritual and scientific. It\u2019s really interesting. Yeah. So you studied biology and then you became a journalist. I mean, here you are with this very 21st-century life. You\u2019ve been writing about the environment and climate change looks to me like nearly three decades. So, I mean, you have a very different life from this Jesuit paleontologist. But I see things you say, like \u201Cwe are slowly enveloping the world in our own intelligence.\u201D It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that Teilhard de Chardin was saying from such a different vantage point, you know, a hundred years ago. I know. Well, then as I dug in even more, I did a piece a few years ago on Dot Earth, tracing this back through actually V\u00E1clav Havel and then back to Darwin. In The Descent of Man, in 1871, Darwin wrote a passage about how we were fundamentally tribal, but that the more that human were interrelating with each other, you know, through commerce, through trade, the more our sense of tribe would expand. Then he said, only an artificial barrier stands before we will become essentially one tribe, not just intelligence, but a global community. And now, of course, we\u2019re breaching that artificial barrier with technology. And you talk about this also in evolutionary terms. I mean, you say things like, you know, \u201Cwe have been in puberty as a species,\u201D and science is saying to us you have to grow up. And yet, it\u2019s tricky, isn\u2019t it? Because this technology that maybe somebody like Teilhard or Darwin couldn\u2019t have conceived is also in its infancy, right? I mean, that it\u2019s growing us up and yet we have to grow it up at the same time. Oh, yeah, and there was a wonderful cover story in National Geographic sometime last year by my friend David Dobbs, on the teenage brain. And everything he said about the teenage brain is exactly replicated when you look around the world at the turbulent nature of how we\u2019re using information right now. Oh, my gosh, that\u2019s so interesting. Right. And one thing that was fascinating was he said that the transition from teenage brain to adult brain involves a lot of not just new wiring, but rewiring. Things are kind of being unmade and remade. All these connections in the brain are fundamentally going through transformations and, of course, that\u2019s reflected in behavior through it and all kinds of turbulence. So you look at anything from stock markets to the way the Tahrir Square events unfolded and then kind of refolded and kind of modulated themselves through Twitter and Facebook, to me it\u2019s as if we\u2019re test driving new wiring and we definitely have not figured out how it\u2019s all going to work. Then as a blogger, you know, I live in this arena. It can flame up a lie instantaneously, but then the reality becomes exposed equally. Not quite as instantaneously, but, you know, Wikipedia has proved \u2014 I think I saw a study that Wikipedia entries now are on a par with Encyclopedia Britannica entries in terms of their reliability, if not greater. And that\u2019s all part of \u2014 you know, the upside of all this for me is that we\u2019re evolving the capacity to collaborate constructively. And as I say, you know, it could work in two directions. Right. So if we kind of take this fossil analogy, this world that Teilhard lived in, I mean, the way you see it, if we think about this noosphere, this planetary mind, the Internet is really \u2014 where\u2019d you say once somewhere, \u201Cone cable and computer at a time,\u201D this is kind of the skeleton building infrastructure of this noosphere. Yeah, and this leads to some interesting questions. You know, there are the Kurzweils of the world. I talked about the singularity when they kind of see the potential for this system to essentially become more powerful than we are. But I think what\u2019s actually much more powerful right now underway is this growing capacity for this system to help us collaboratively create things, and collaboratively feel things and experience things as well in ways that weren\u2019t possible before. So it\u2019s actually this kind of capacity to share and shape ideas that\u2019s just hard to \u2014 it\u2019s mind-boggling. It\u2019s not just a function of computing power; there\u2019s something else that\u2019s going on. So Teilhard\u2019s \u2014 the word he coined was noosphere, n-o-o-s from the Greek for mind, and you have taken that up and are calling it the knowosphere, k-n-o-w-osphere. Sure . And I\u2019m just wondering did you start making this kind of observation you\u2019re making and then discover this word for describing it, or did the word itself help clarify what you were seeing and thinking? I guess the first time I mentioned it in print was back in 2002 when we did a special report for the Science Times section that I came up with about managing planet earth. And the lead piece had just \u2014 it seemed so obvious to me after having spent all this time, you know, the first 20 years of my writing about sustainability issues, climate and biodiversity. Then came this aha moment more recently where I started writing more about the behavioral sciences and how we recognize environmental problems, what kinds of risks we were bad at recognizing. And I got into this whole body of empirical work, you know, good solid science that showed that, if you\u2019re not paying attention to the mind part, you could spend your life whether as a journalist or a scientist articulating a problem and not have anyone actually engage with that problem. One of the other tough realities with issues like climate change is that it violates all the norms of the kinds of things that we actually do pay attention to, which are usually near and now. You\u2019re only going to have attraction when you have a true sense of a global community, you know, when you really do integrate that the atmosphere is a shared treasure. Right, in a very present and visceral sense of that. Yeah, and so you\u2019re not going to have that unless you have planetary mind. So that\u2019s why I pay attention to this stuff. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 today exploring the present unfolding of the ideas of the 20th-century Jesuit priest and paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin. Andrew Revkin both picks up and creates echoes of Teilhard\u2019s ideas as a journalist and blogger. Here\u2019s some language from you again, that whatever term you use \u2014 and you were referring back to the noosphere idea. \u201CIt\u2019s clear that the world is quickly being knitted by new ways to share observations and shape ideas that are bound to have impact on the quality of the human journey.\u201D That is kind of spiritual language. I mean, do you use the word spirituality? Well, sure. Well, you know, and this gets back to another ugly reality of issues like climate change, which is they\u2019re always cast as scientific. But when you actually examine rigorously the decision process, you realize it quickly moves from the realm of science into the realm of values. In other words, how much is too much? How much warming is too much? It\u2019s not a science question. There are all these trade-offs. Well, you know, it\u2019s going to cost poor people more money to have energies if we shift away from fossil fuels, so how do we weigh the benefits there versus the benefits of slowing sea level rise or, you know, reducing the risk of crop failure? None of those are really scientific questions. They get into the realm of economics and very quickly into the realm of values. Right. And, I mean, I suppose we can get pretty tangled up when we\u2019re speaking in the realm of fact, but when you start talking about values, it becomes very fraught in another way. Yeah. Well, this is a different word I\u2019ve proposed. You know, this era has been increasingly called the anthropocene, sort of the era of the human-managed planet. I wrote a piece a year or so ago. In fact, I thought about writing a book about this, but I just haven\u2019t had time \u2014 is that we need to have a little of what I call anthropophilia if we\u2019re going to have a smooth ride in anthropocene, which means we have to get more comfortable with our differences. Within any population, you\u2019re going to have people who will have different judgments about the same body of science. And only by having a connectedness so that such that when you go onto the Web, you\u2019re not staying in your own little bubble, whether it\u2019s a green bubble or a Libertarian bubble , but willing to reach out to understand other peoples\u2019 views. Then that\u2019s also part of the noosphere, sort of finding places where you can get people who have maybe fundamentally different views of a certain energy choice, but might have the same view on energy efficiency. Then you say, oh, there\u2019s the place we can work. And that\u2019s all part of this too, I think. Yeah, and, I mean, again, that\u2019s where I feel like when I read Teilhard de Chardin 100 years ago, I feel like there was something so prescient. To me, the way you just talked is a reflection of him saying something like it\u2019s important that we focus on the interior as well as the exterior of things, on mind as well as matter. You know, he said, \u201CThe true physics is that which will, one day, achieve the inclusion of man in his wholeness in a coherent picture of the world.\u201D Yeah. All I can say is yeah . So, but I see you using terms like, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s not inevitable that this technology drives towards this kind of coherence, but you talk about language like engagement and intentionality. And you\u2019re talking about our relationship with our technology and all these things that are becoming possible? Sure. I teach a course at Pace University that I launched last year \u2014this is the second year \u2014 in blogging. And it\u2019s really not a course just in blogging; it\u2019s a course in how to get the most out of the Internet, how to get the most out of all this connectivity. This is all about intentionality. In fact, it\u2019s not a course \u2014 the course is called Blogging a Better Planet, but I don\u2019t define better planet. I ask them to take their own passions and find some little \u2014 in other words, there might be a student who\u2019s interested in fashion or another in music, which is the case this year. Another one in travel. And I say find the component of the thing that excites you that also fits in this frame of smoothing our journey. So if you don\u2019t have intentionality, you could go out there and just sell widgets. The Internet is really good at selling widgets. And as I say, you know, the Internet helped the 9/11 organizers learn where to find their flight schools and stuff. So it can work in terrible ways as well. But I see the upside swamping the downside, especially if young people early on are trained \u2014 not trained, but learn on their own how this can work for betterment. This is a fun thing: When I give my talks these days. I show this little video clip that my younger son \u2014 he and I a few years ago went rowing in an area in suburban Florida near where my parents live. There was a little kind of a mangrove patch in the middle of suburbia, and we went rowing up in there and he had the video camera and shot a little documentary \u2014 at the age of nine \u2014 of heron babies. This is a close-up in the mangroves. See if we can spot any animals. You know, it was an incredibly valuable experience for him to have, but by recording it and then posting it on YouTube, he had a durable experience. Those are the babies. Oh, yes, there they are! There they are! Move back, move back! That\u2019s a baby Tricolored Heron. They are cute. And the sharing of that information, which is a primordial thing \u2014 remember, human beings, whether it\u2019s around the campfire or at the bedside, you know, we just love to say what we experience. So for him, he has a richer way to handle that experience of having come upon and sort of discovered these hatchling herons by having had the hybrid experience of sharing that through the Internet. I think it\u2019s much more durable for him as a result. Yeah, and that\u2019s interesting too. It\u2019s an example of how we don\u2019t just share knowledge, that we can share experience in a new way. Yeah, and that\u2019s why noosphere is not perfect because it kind of implies this is all about knowledge. It\u2019s mental, yeah. And it\u2019s not. You know, a criticism I hear, skeptical people in the 20th century certainly felt that Teilhard de Chardin was too much of an optimist, that his vision was too hopeful, that it presupposed too much goodness on the part of human beings. I think it\u2019s so interesting to hear the way you talk about the fact that the way this technology is shaping up and our use of it, it actually doesn\u2019t just come down to our goodness, right? You\u2019re talking about the technology as these structures and networks as they form become kind of self-correcting because there\u2019s this mass of human mind involved? I share his optimism overall. I think our potential for good as a species has always dominated the potential for bad in the end and this just amplifies those same tendencies. None of the issues that we face on the internet are unique to the internet. They\u2019re all \u2026 What do you mean by that? Well, they\u2019re all part of who we are. In a crowded room, the loudest, angriest people, whatever their ideology, tend to get the most airtime. So one thing I try to do on my blog is try to build tools to foster some input from the quieter people. Another metaphor that comes to mind is it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been plunked at the wheel of a speeding car, but we haven\u2019t taken driver\u2019s training and there isn\u2019t even a driver\u2019s manual for the car. We\u2019re rounding a corner and the weather is foggy and we\u2019re accelerating . So in a moment like that, you can either be hopeful or woeful, but it almost doesn\u2019t matter in the end. You know, we\u2019re test-driving a new system here. Turbulence is normal, experiments in communication will fail as much or more than they will succeed, but I think our overall nature, to my mind \u2014 and it\u2019s an act of faith on my part as it was on his part \u2026 On Teilhard\u2019s part. Yeah. We\u2019ll swamp the down side. Andrew Revkin. Here in closing, some lines from Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s book The Phenomenon of Man: \u201CIn these confused and restless zones in which present blends with future in a world of upheaval, we stand face to face with all the grandeur, the unprecedented grandeur, of The Phenomenon of Man What has made us so different from our forebears, so ambitious too, and so worried, is not merely that we have discovered and mastered other forces of nature. It is that we have become conscious of the movement which is carrying us along.\u201D You can find our recommendations on writing by Teilhard de Chardin and books about his life and theology by Ursula King at onbeing.org. And we\u2019ve collected some of Andrew Revkin\u2019s Teilhard de Chardin-related musings from the dot earth blog \u2014 everything from his take on the knowosphere; to that image he likes of how our global tumult resembles the teenage brain and an interview he did with Pete Seeger on science and spirit. Andrew Revkin has recently released a CD of his own music called \u201CA Very Fine Line.\u201D You can listen again or share this show on Teilhard de Chardin through our website onbeing.org.
