  "fullText": "I hope that we can learn to see that dignity that\u2019s in all of us, that divinity that comes when we organize together, when we meet each other face-to-face, and even sometimes through a chat room \u2014 how to tell those stories. How to hold up those moments where we find our agency and our ability to make a change. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. And that\u2019s what I hope, more than anything, to contribute. There is a kind of brilliance that flashes up in early adulthood: an ability to see the world whole. My guest today, Nathan Schneider, has been able to articulate and sustain that far-seeing eye of young adulthood. He\u2019s also a gifted writer, chronicling the world he and his compatriots are helping to make \u2014 spiritual, technological, communal. Could the growing number of non-religious young people be a force for the renewal of spiritual traditions? How might the internet of the future look utterly different from the internet of now? And what did the Occupy movement really tap into, and what has it become below the radar? With Nathan Schneider, we explore the wisdom of a millennial generation public intellectual on the emerging fabric of human identity. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with Nathan Schneider in 2014 before a live audience at the outdoor Hall of Philosophy of the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York. When I set out to write the introduction to Nathan, I discovered his introduction of himself on his website or blog. And Nathan Schneider\u2019s self-introduction is both poetic and deeply informative. It\u2019s going to tell you as much as I could have in different terms. \u201CI\u2019m Nathan Schneider, a writer and editor based in Brooklyn. I published a book each on God and the Occupy movement. Writing articles for a variety of publications, from Harpers, The Nation, and the Chronicle of Higher Education to The New Inquiry and The Catholic Worker keeps my notebooks filled. Editing the online religion magazine, Killing the Buddha, keeps me odd.\u201D \u201CWaging Nonviolence, a publication I co-founded, keeps me up on struggles for justice around the world. And being a contributing editor at the Social Science Research Council\u2019s online forum, The Immanent Frame, keeps me in touch with the Academy.\u201D So glad that you made this trip. So, I want to start out \u2014 I\u2019m not sure about this \u2014 in what year and where were you born? I was born in 1984, and had the chance to experience a really rich slice of American religious diversity and pluralism in that upbringing. That was in Arlington, Virginia, inside the Beltway, in the midst of the political circus, but in a very rich home, with a Jewish father and a mother who\u2019d grown up in the Protestant tradition. And both of them, together, were searchers. And I got to go along with that in the midst of my childhood. You write about your parents in a wonderful way, and I sense that they weren\u2019t just spiritual seekers, but spiritual experimenters. And I have to say, you \u2014 after millennia in which most human beings in most cultures inherited religious identity almost like they inherited hair color and skin color, you are this new phenomenon of the 21st century, in this culture, certainly, where you were invited to create your spiritual life yourself. Yeah, and I\u2019ve been puzzling with the uniqueness of that, the feeling of uniqueness. As I was growing up, I think I felt that there was something kind of strange about this upbringing and this circumstance. One thing that I noticed as I got older, especially, really, as I started studying religion in a more formal context, I started realizing, actually, this weirdness that I encountered is everywhere. And I\u2019m not alone in that. And then, actually, that this is not new to our time, that when we look back at the past, that people were grappling with many of these questions, as well. That globalization is not new, and the interchange of ideas among traditions is not new, and the kinds of struggles that we\u2019re going through are ones that many of the great thinkers and experimenters, as you put it, of our religious traditions, who we kind of ossify and contain and put into boxes and try to own and control \u2014 we\u2019re actually, in many cases, working out very similar circumstances. And you went on this quest, looking both across history at that ancient search, that ancient inquiry, into these big existential questions. And then you write, \u201COne almost-gone afternoon in November, as I stepped out into what sun remained in the day, a proof for the existence of God took hold of me.\u201D Tell us a little bit about the nature of that proof. Oh, gosh. Well, I try to avoid explaining what that experience was because I have no idea, still. But, see, what had happened was that \u2014 around the time I was 17 or 18, this funny thing happened in the midst of this very interesting upbringing that I found myself drawn into the Catholic church. I was baptized and confirmed, and entered the church at age 18 at the Easter Vigil. And this was after a year of really particularly furious searching on my own part that began when I encountered a monastery in Virginia that my mother had actually suggested I go to, a Catholic Trappist monastery. And it lit something up in me at that time. And as I was arriving at college, a very intellectually stimulating place, an intellectually oriented place, I wanted to intellectually orient myself around this thing that was happening. And I spent a lot of the next ten years exploring that word, \u201Cproof,\u201D trying to come to terms with this experience that was happening in me, often in many cases, in relation to that word. One thing \u2014 you looked back at one of the classic seekers of a proof, St. Anselm. And one of the observations you made as you grappled with that, and with the whole way this question has been taken up across time, is that what was really in that approach to a proof was not the question of whether God exists as much as how we think about God and how we think about one another. Yes. Absolutely. That was something that was so striking to me. This was a time when the New Atheists were just getting going, this was right after 9/11\u00A0\u2014 those were the things that were happening in the world around me. So this question of \u201CDoes God exist? Is religion real? Is it something that \u2014 what is its relationship to violence?\u201D The stakes of these questions were very, very high. And they were framed in terms of that question, \u201CDoes God exist?\u201D \u201CIs there anything \u2018there, there\u2019?\u201D Right? And as I started diving into the tradition of what I thought would be people trying to answer that question, I actually realized that that was not so much what was on their minds. And the real power of a lot of these arguments of these so-called proofs, Anselm\u2019s being a particularly vital one, is in the kind of relationship that they\u2019re forging, the way in which they express God in and through an account of relationship between people. A lot of the philosophical language that Anselm uses I realized was also in a letter that he had written to a friend describing his admiration and affection for this friend. This language that is always presented in these textbooks as being a kind of yes-or-no, cut-and-dry logical statement was, for him, a statement of affection. It was still a statement of logic, but you can\u2019t separate that logic from that affection. And so in the course of entering this question of proof, wanting that yes-or-no answer for myself, I had to come to terms with the fact that the way I\u2019d been framing the question, the way the question was being framed around me, was not the only way to do it. And maybe it wasn\u2019t the best way. Or maybe even the most interesting way. So your generation that \u2014 this age right now has given rise to this phenomenon that\u2019s been defined by opinion polls called the \u201CNones,\u201D N-O-N-E-S. Again, it comes from multiple-choice question, and \u201CNones\u201D refers to people who say that they have no religious affiliation, are not ready to put that label on themselves. It\u2019s something like 20 percent of Americans now, and one third of adults under 30, are religious \u2014 self-described religiously unaffiliated. I\u2019ve really been looking forward to this discussion with you because I want to ask you about that. Because it seems to me that what you\u2019re describing, which is trying to figure out what these traditions are about at their heart, and across time and space, and in their best expression. And often not being religiously affiliated because you don\u2019t see the traditions living up to what they\u2019re capable of. I experience a lot of spiritual searching, a lot of theological curiosity, and certainly a lot of ethical passion. So tell me how you think about the Nones and what\u2019s going on there. Well, it\u2019s a really vexing formulation. First of all, it\u2019s impossible to pronounce without also spelling, which is a problem. I would say it\u2019s not the ones on the bus. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say. I find myself doing that a lot. And I think it requires us to turn our heads around a little bit. On the one hand, one thing I experienced when I became a Roman Catholic, drawn in by this medieval contemplative tradition, as well as this tradition of courageous social witness exemplified by the Catholic Worker and many other examples throughout history and around the world \u2014 I came into Catholic churches and realized that many of the people who were going to those churches, they didn\u2019t really know about that stuff. They didn\u2019t know their own tradition. They were kind of keeping on, in many cases, certainly not all, but with a kind of inertia. On the other hand, people I\u2019ve found outside of these spaces, of these churches, were intensely interested in these questions, had very good questions that they were trying to think through and work through. They didn\u2019t feel like they could really commit themselves to these institutions, but they were curious, and they were looking for something. And it was so striking to me to \u2014 fast-forward to book two, which, in my head, fits together with book one in these funny ways \u2026 Well, I want to name the titles, because they\u2019re great titles. The first \u2014 book one is God in Proof: The Story of a Search from the Ancients to the Internet, and book two is Thank You, Anarchy: Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse. Right. Thank you for the footnote. As I was saying, \u201CGod book\u201D and \u201COccupy book,\u201D we can call them that. Yeah, OK, the \u201CGod\u201D and the \u201COccupy book.\u201D When young people in this secular social political movement started turning their attention to churches, and sometimes, actually, for instance, protesting in front of churches, it wasn\u2019t that they were protesting that this was a church, or the things that a church would claim to believe. What they were actually saying was, \u201CChurch, act like a church.\u201D And these were people who \u2014 many of whom had never really been a part of a church community or another kind of religious community, or if they had, they\u2019d had some experience of alienation. But the general identity was a kind of \u2014 that of the Nones. But it was so striking to me that that was the cry. \u201CAct like a church.\u201D And I still keep on my \u2014 the background screen on my little cell phone, while I\u2019m pulling up my Facebook and my Twitter and all that stuff, is a picture of what happened after Hurricane Sandy, when those Occupiers filled churches with rescue supplies through a process of organization, not managed by the state or by corporations. And that was what became \u2014 what they called \u201COccupy Sandy.\u201D Occupy Sandy, yes. But actually I don\u2019t think that was quite as much in the headlines or covered as much. I\u2019m not sure people necessarily know that Occupy Sandy was something that grew out of Occupy Wall Street. Yes. Why don\u2019t you tell that story a little bit? Well, absolutely. So, when Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and surrounding regions, immediately, a small group of people who had been involved in Occupy Wall Street who knew each other through that protest experience decided that they were going to organize some kind of relief effort. They had to do something. And so they did. And they happened to be \u2014 had the first website up, the first place on the ground where people could deliver supplies, in churches. And they ended up becoming a major part of the early phases of the relief effort, which is still ongoing and is still tremendously unequal. But it was really interesting to see, in the course of that process, the way in which this group of people, many of whom did not have comfortable relationships with traditional religious institutions, work with religious folks, work with these religious communities. On the one hand, see the power of those communities, see the resilience of those communities in a way that their movement had not been able to build for itself. And on the other hand, to see what they could draw from the ideas of those traditions. They started talking about jubilee. They started recognizing that there was something real in this religious language that connected with the frustrations that they were feeling with the society around them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with writer and millennial generation public intellectual Nathan Schneider. We spoke in a live event in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution. So sometimes I think about Bonhoeffer\u2019s phrase \u201Creligionless Christianity,\u201D which he didn\u2019t really live to develop. He wrote in his letters and papers from prison, where he died \u2014 the Nazi prison where he died. But, he, in his era, and a very different set of circumstances, but in his circumstances, where the church was completely co-opted by a corrupt state, he came to believe that the essential truths and the essential impulses of Christianity would survive even in the absence of religion. And, sometimes, I feel like what you\u2019re describing is, whether you agree with the politics of Occupy or not, that passion for social justice, which has been carried across time in a lot of our religious institutions, alive and vibrant, and actually making a practical difference in the lives of these young people who define themselves outside the walls of these institutions. Yeah, it\u2019s such a tantalizing passage that so many people ever since have been trying to unpack. And it\u2019s also in Barth, it\u2019s something that comes up in a lot of modern religious thought. Something of it in Hegel, as well. Many others. There was the Death of God phenomenon in the 1960s. It sold more issues of Time magazine than any cover ever had when they asked \u201CIs God Dead?\u201D in red type on black background. There\u2019s something tantalizing about that question. And \u201CIs the church really necessary?\u201D \u201CAre these communities really necessary?\u201D My feeling about it \u2014 and we can\u2019t know what Bonhoeffer thought \u2014 but I think that these communities are necessary. And I think these institutions are necessary. That traditions are. Traditions, communities, institutions. But they are necessary only to the extent, of course, to which they\u2019re willing to undertake that paradox that I think is at the heart of any religious tradition of constant renewal alongside respect for tradition. Of a space for a prophetic voice in the midst of the kind of priestly cohesion. That\u2019s a tension that you see in so many traditions. It\u2019s something that we all confront in so many different ways. And I think that\u2019s a challenge that the Nones amongst us are facing right now. I think there isn\u2019t a sense of satisfaction with being a None. It\u2019s isolating. It\u2019s not an ending point. Right. So what this makes me wonder is if the Nones \u2014 and, again, I just find language so awful in so many ways \u2014 are actually like monastics in the early centuries of Christianity, these forces for spiritual renewal that actually collected outside the institutions. If the Nones, in fact, the new non-religious, may be the forces that will renew religion in this century, if it is to be renewed. That\u2019s a really \u2014 I think an important connection to draw. The monastic movement formed, in Christianity, at least, right about the moment when Christianity became the religion of empire. It formed in response to the institutionalization of the faith, of this recognition that there has to be something else. There\u2019s another part here that we\u2019re missing when we\u2019re just doing the institution. Institutions will always fail us. And the institution, they felt, was failing them. And I think that\u2019s something that every generation has to confront in new ways. We\u2019ve talked about diversity a lot this week at Chautauqua. And there\u2019s this funny thing I have to tell all of you. So, I wanted to put together as diverse a program as possible for these five days. And it has been in so many ways. And I only notice at the very end that \u2014 I didn\u2019t pay any attention to religious diversity, OK? And we have four Roman Catholics. Four Roman Catholics and one Methodist, and the biggest common denominator from my life of that is that my Southern-Baptist grandfather would say none of you are going to heaven. But on the other hand, any of you who\u2019ve been here all week, you could not have a more diverse four Catholics, right? A Brazilian intellectual, a Mexican-American writer, an African-American Catholic, grew up in Alabama, and Nathan, who grew up and adopted Catholicism as an adult. So that\u2019s really, really been fun unpacking this word \u201Cdiversity.\u201D You also talk about the confrontation with diversity and the difficulty of it as something that was very challenging inside the Occupy movement. Yeah, I think it was really kind of crucial to the undoing of the community that formed there. There was a tremendous amount of violence happening around the Occupation that formed in New York City and the many, many occupations in cities all around the country and around the world. But the internal tension, especially in a lot of the big-city Occupations in the U.S., ended up being about race, and about class. About the things that divide us that we don\u2019t know how to talk about. \u201CWe are the 99 percent\u201D was this rallying cry, but it turned out that we are the 99 percent in a lot of different ways. And some of us have been more impacted by the kinds of economic inequality and inequity that the movement was so concerned about in far graver ways for longer periods of time, through generations. And as people in the movement came in, the educational process that I would see happen again and again was that, suddenly, people were realizing, as they stripped away the usual political discourse \u2014 no one was talking about candidates, nobody was talking about Herman Cain\u2019s sexual foibles, which everyone was talking about at the time \u2014 people started recognizing the pain that so many in our society are carrying that we don\u2019t have language to talk about. And because the movement had not initially been built around that pain, built around leadership by people who are most impacted, it ended up marginalizing a lot of those people over and over again. And that was deeply frustrating and deeply hurtful. It\u2019s something that we see in movements a lot of the time. That the injustices in the outside world replicate themselves inside any community where we try to constitute ourselves and start over again. But it was deeply puzzling and deeply troubling to many people, and, I think, for the better, changed a lot of lives. It sent a lot of those people off into places where they can support those who are most vulnerable, where they can connect the local with the global in a way that they hadn\u2019t thought to before. And I think that\u2019s part of the story that hasn\u2019t really been told. It\u2019s certainly true of the Civil Rights Movement, that it spawned these other movements. Because those injustices were in the movement themselves, became so apparent and so problematic. Now, certainly, we have a very short sense of time in this culture. So it looks now like Occupy failed and went away, right? I think that\u2019s how many people think about it. So it\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about that legacy that still lives on among us in quiet ways. Well, one of the great privileges for me while I was working on covering what was happening with the Occupy movement was I was also \u2014 I had this responsibility to edit columns that were being written for this website, wagingnonviolence.org, by a pair of Civil Rights veterans. And one of them had been working with SNCC. One of them had been marching with King. These were people who were closely involved in the organizing work of that movement and many movements since. And I\u2019d be talking to them and say, the media\u2019s saying this, everybody\u2019s coming up with the \u2014 \u201CWhere are the demands?\u201D \u201CWho are the leaders?\u201D All of these usual questions. \u201CThis is chaotic.\u201D \u201CIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201D Everyone was saying this. What do I do? Are they right? And these folks would say, \u201CYeah, that\u2019s what we were dealing with, too. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s how these things go. Just roll with it.\u201D And that kind of recognition was so powerful to me, and, also, I think, so missing. It\u2019s such a reminder of the amnesia that we give ourselves about our social movements. We tell our history in the stories of great men. And that\u2019s such a tiny, tiny, tiny slice of what really moves \u2014 what has moved our history, and we forget what these movements have looked like. And we forget how to build strong ones in the future. Mm-hmm. I did a conversation at the end of last year which included Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons, who was one of the leaders of the Mississippi Freedom Summers. She was about 19. And it ended up being a lesson for all us that, yeah, we remember \u2014 now, 50 years on, we have this triumphal memory of the March on Washington, Selma to Montgomery. And just these mundane realities were so important where I said to her \u2014 she\u2019d written about going to Mississippi, and I said, \u201CI noticed you were writing about the same period in which the March on Washington happened, and you didn\u2019t mention it.\u201D She said, \u201CThe March on Washington? My parents wouldn\u2019t let me go to the March on Washington.\u201D Right? So we have this idea now that they all knew what they were creating, and that ultimately there would be this triumphant memory of it. And they didn\u2019t. And these kids had all the resistance that kids now have from their parents. Anyway, that\u2019s kind of an aside. But it is important, because if we don\u2019t remember the human complexity and messiness, then we tend, I think, to overestimate how hard it feels for us to get things moving. Absolutely. Absolutely. And we saw this so much in the course of the disappointment and frustration that the Occupy experience led so many idealistic people toward. And I think a lot of the reason for that was \u2014 actually fell on the storytellers. A lot of these people were working with the story that was told, for instance, about the Tahrir Square uprising in Egypt. They really, in many cases, saw themselves not as Americans rising up as another kind of Tea Party, but as actually joining a global movement that was happening around the world. Yeah. It was very striking to me. You wrote, \u201CI had been watching revolutions from a distance since the beginning of the year.\u201D Absolutely. And one thing that I was noticing about the way those stories were being told was that it was just about the flicker that happens on the streets for three weeks. It was just about the flash, about the spectacle. And, again, through my work with Waging Nonviolence, I had been in touch with organizers who had been working with Egyptian activists for years and years and years. And had been developing a lot of the networks out of which that uprising came. So when I saw the CNN reports, I thought, well, that\u2019s not really the story. There\u2019s another drama here. There\u2019s a drama of long and patient organizing, and failing, and failing, and failing, seemingly over and over again. There was another story of what was going on in the midst of it, about what unions were doing, about ways in which the texture of Egyptian society was shifting at that moment. And then ways, of course, in which it would flip back. And I think, because of the way we told that story, it set up a lot of young people for a kind of disappointment. And then it set up a lot of other people to say, where\u2019s your Martin Luther King coming from the sky to tell you what to do? It was a very strange set of expectations that we\u2019ve been prepared for by the way we tell our stories. And I think it\u2019s very important for those of us who tell stories to break through that. You can listen again and share this conversation with Nathan Schneider through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a live conversation with the millennial generation public intellectual Nathan Schneider. He\u2019s the author of two books: God in Proof: The Story of a Search from the Ancients to the Internet and Thank You Anarchy: Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse. We spoke in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York, in a week exploring the \u201CAmerican Consciousness.\u201D So let\u2019s talk for a minute about technology. I like this language I\u2019ve been hearing lately of \u201Cdigital natives,\u201D that people of new, emerging generations have grown up and are native. And I think that\u2019s helpful, because I think the rest of us spend a lot of our time aware that we walked onto this frontier in mid-life, and we may never catch up. And we are trying to learn the language, and just be oriented. And that\u2019s the best we can do. But digital natives are going to be differently hard-wired, and have different instincts and intuitions. And I wonder what your \u2014 if you have a sense of that, of how technology is forming and reforming human nature, capacity. I think that term, \u201Cdigital native,\u201D is troubling. Do you? Yeah. It\u2019s a funny word. There is something true about it. There\u2019s definitely something true about it, and there\u2019s definitely ways in which this experience is shaping us. But I think it\u2019s also important to recognize what kind of natives are being produced by the kind of technology that we are, I think, in many cases, consuming. In some ways it\u2019s analogous to the shift from a generation that knew how to repair cars to a generation dealing with cars that can\u2019t really be repaired, except by computer and expert and garage, right? You have to send your car back to the manufacturer in order to get it \u2014 even the tiniest thing, and they just replace the part rather than actually fixing it. I think something like that is going on with a lot of the technology we interact with. You see people growing up knowing how to use this stuff the way that it\u2019s been set up to use, but they don\u2019t necessarily have a whole lot of knowledge about what\u2019s going on back there. Or what other kinds of choices could have been made in designing those things. Why is it that we\u2019re using Facebook instead of something that we control, that we can make decisions about privacy for? Why is it that we\u2019re stuck, in many cases, using operating systems that we have to update all the time in order to get the latest software, and we pay for every round of updates, rather than being able to use community-driven open-source software? You started out studying computer science, right? In college? Yeah. I was drawn to that really for the same reason I was drawn to religion \u2014 because I was interested in the stuff that was affecting our imaginations. I had this idea that I might do a thesis about how people organize their files on their computers, right? Because some people have a total mess where everything\u2019s everywhere. And then some people have everything very beautifully displayed, but we never talk about how and why we make those decisions. And I was just so curious about that. But it\u2019s those decisions that I\u2019m interested in technology. It\u2019s not yes or no, technology or no technology. It\u2019s what kind of decisions can we make about how we use that technology, how we structure the economics of it, how we build communities around it? There\u2019s been this idea running around for a decade or so that it would be a lot more efficient if we used something called \u201Cmesh networking,\u201D rather than the traditional ISPs and wireless networks that deliver our internet. This would be a way in which people are basically feeding each other the internet all the time, rather than everyone getting it independently from Comcast or whichever. But it doesn\u2019t work, partly because we\u2019re not organized enough, our neighborhoods aren\u2019t organized enough to make that happen, to build the relationships that that kind of networking would happen. The people who do build those kinds of networks always have to do it on the basis of existing, offline, flesh communities. So I think it\u2019s so important that when we talk about technology, we\u2019re also able to talk about how we relate to each other in other ways. And Sherry Turkle, who wrote that book that got a lot of attention a couple of years ago from MIT, Alone Together. She makes this really important point that because the internet has so quickly taken over so many aspects of our lives, we feel like it\u2019s full-blown. And, in fact, the internet is in its infancy, and it\u2019s up to us to grow it up and to shape it to human purposes. I really do think that has to be the work of the new generations. That maybe you all don\u2019t know how to repair the back end of the internet, but we\u2019ll never be able to figure it out. Well, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time lately exploring some of the frontiers of ways in which people are doing that. Yeah. So tell us. For instance, I was just at a place in Southern Italy where activists, hackers, mainly, from around Europe, technology activists, have been gathering and actually adopting and playing with hacking, so to speak, the rule of St. Benedict, the rule that\u2019s the basis of Western Christian monasticism, looking at it as a kind of protocol, as a kind of basis for building sustainable, sustaining communities. They look at the way in which monasteries carried civilization through the Dark Ages. Preserving the art of writing. They\u2019re looking to this religious legacy as a means for starting from scratch. And thinking about their \u2014 about what kinds of reorientations they could make in their relationships with the technology that they\u2019re using, and how they could build livelihoods for themselves in a way analogous to monks. And, again, these are not people who affiliate themselves with any religious communities in particular. Yet they\u2019re drawn to something that is in these traditions. They recognize something is there, and they don\u2019t feel that they can go to the existing institutions to explore these. And so they\u2019re kind of playing around on their own. That is really interesting. I also find there\u2019s a paradox, as much as we talk about how technology is dividing us, and we\u2019re all on our phones, which we are. There\u2019s also this total paradox that this is the age of convenings, and even in our media space, people \u2014 the more interesting the digital spaces get, the more people say, we\u2019d really like to get together. Meet each other in person. And you said this beautiful thing \u2014 this is from your God in Proof book \u2014 \u201CReason alone, one way or another, eventually turns into reasoning together. It sees the light of day, it meets its own history, it strikes up a conversation and is never the same afterward.\u201D And that was something I saw very vividly in the midst of the Occupy movement. Here was something that was organized on the basis of an email that got sent out by a magazine with no actual on-the-ground organizing, initially, whatsoever. And it got spread and went viral. It started because it went viral on the internet. This is as internet-driven as you can get. Yet at every major occupation, there would be a print newspaper within a couple of weeks. And over time, as it developed, the posters started growing. The art, the print, it was \u2014 everything was printed. The first company to come out of Occupy Wall Street was a worker-owned co-op that was a print shop. It was a print shop. It wasn\u2019t a social media shop. It was a place in a warehouse to print flyers and to print beautiful posters. And so it was really \u2014 as a writer, as somebody who loves books, that was very exciting to see, on the one hand, this vibrancy of online participation alongside this commitment to the presence of the text. And I think that was also driven by the fact that there was this presence of people together. Of bodies, yeah. Yeah, the bodies were \u2014 it was so important. That occupied space, for whatever one might think of what was being said from it and what you might have heard about what went on there, what drew people there was the sense of sacred space. And everyone knew that that sacredness was just created by the fact that all those people were there, and just talking to each other, and just sharing experiences all over the place. So many people you\u2019d hear, they were just talking and talking and talking and talking as if nobody had ever listened to them in their entire lives. And then they talked themselves out, and then they would finally start listening to somebody else. But it was this fundamental, essential human experience that seems like, oh, wait, this has been missing from our lives. And this isn\u2019t necessarily antithetical to technology, but it demands that we have a different kind of relationship to it. OK. Let\u2019s involve you in the discussion. This mic is on, and we\u2019ll have ten minutes or so for your questions. I do want to say, in terms of the redemptive qualities of technology, your fianc\u00E9 is here today. And you told me you\u2019re getting married in a month. And Nathan told me that they met through a dating site that a friend of his created. And what did you say? You said something really \u2014 this is why I don\u2019t like to have conversation before the conversation. You said it\u2019s a 21st-century way of people meeting through friends. Basically, yeah. It was a case where a friend of mine is a computer programmer, and he was involved in a startup to build a dating website. It ended up kind of catching on in other guises, but that particular project didn\u2019t work out, except I met the wonderful woman I\u2019m about to marry through it. OK. Yes. Hi. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Before you do that, I need to do my radio thing, sorry. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with writer and millennial generation public intellectual, Nathan Schneider, we\u2019re in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York. The Occupy Wall Street movement \u2014 could you please give us a Twitter-like synopsis of its origin, its goals, the outcome, and, specifically, what was in that email that went viral? I\u2019m going to give you 280 characters for that one. The email just said, \u201COccupy Wall Street. Bring tent. What is our one demand? September 17.\u201D The \u201CWhat is our one demand?\u201D thing kind of got ditched in the course of things. But something about those words, those three words, \u201COccupy Wall Street,\u201D resonated with people. And I think any of us who don\u2019t see why need to look a little more closely into the structure of our society. Those three words resonated with millions and millions of people. They knew exactly what that meant. Another three words that I think were very important for me in understanding what was going on, again, came from the Spanish occupation movement that had begun in May of 2011 in Spain, in Madrid. They rallied under the banner \u201CReal Democracy Now.\u201D That\u2019s very powerful. It sounds very ordinary, but I think it\u2019s very powerful. We grow up being told that we live in a democracy, and yet, over and over, experiencing, in small interactions, in the grand politics, constant messages that we really have no agency, that we, have no control over our futures, that we can\u2019t change \u2014 we can\u2019t stop our society from destroying the planet, for instance. Why is that? What kind of society is one that can\u2019t stop itself from destroying the planet? So I think that\u2019s a long answer, but those are a few short, little slogans, a few short, little tweets that I think actually say a lot, a lot more than they\u2019re given credit for. What is a mesh network? Pass. It\u2019s a different way of configuring an online network, where rather than everybody having a particular hookup to the big cable company, you have a community who are connecting with each other, and they\u2019re sharing their connectivity. And they have a little private network within their community, and then they can also share the connections that they have to the outside network. When you talk to people who were around during the early days of the internet, one of the most interesting questions to ask is, what could have happened but didn\u2019t? The internet didn\u2019t have to be structured the way it is. It didn\u2019t have to be all Google all the time, all Facebook all the time. And, I think, as we consider what our relationship with this technology is, it\u2019s worth looking back to some of the old texts, the old stories of that time to rejuvenate our imaginations, and then also to use those imaginations to think about really more equitable, more just, more profound kinds of connection that this technology of connectivity might allow us. So Nathan, here\u2019s something you wrote. \u201CAs the business of reading technology continues along its trajectory, whether apocalyptic or utopian or both, perhaps those of us who continue to fancy ourselves concerned readers, however much we give into the new and shiny, might turn our attention and new to what one might call inner work.\u201D You then also quoted, William Blake. \u201CHe who binds to himself a joy doth a winged life destroy. He who kisses the joy as it flies lives in eternity\u2019s sunrise.\u201D Tell us what you care about in those lines, what that evokes for you. I found those lines pasted to the wall of the monk who was my baptismal sponsor, who was one of the great friends and mentors of my life. And pretty much the whole time I knew him, he was dying. And at the time, he was getting close. It would be one scare after another, always hooked up to some machine or another. A man who lived a rich and complicated life in the world before entering the monastery, and then lived a rich and complicated life there. At around the time that I saw that on his wall, I asked him what role this God that he had helped lead me toward had meant in his \u2014 in the course of his process of dying, what comfort it had given him. And he said something that I had kind of suspected, which was that he no longer really had that belief anymore. The first feeling that I had with that sense of \u2014 one could feel betrayal, one could feel sadness, a sense of loss. His honesty about that made me feel a sense of gratitude and joy, and also a sense of the mystery of how our lives intertwine and how they play out. That a person who had been losing his faith was the same person who guided me into mine. So last night I met with a group of young people at Chautauqua. I think early 20s and teenagers. And they asked me where I find hope. And I wanted to ask you, as we close \u2014 I want to ask you two questions, possibly intertwined, possibly always intertwined in life. As you look around at the world now, what makes you despair, and what gives you hope? I think the sense of despair that I feel, it comes from the stories. It comes from the stories. When people tell each other stories in which they have no agency. When we tell each other stories in which someone else has to do it for us. And for me, the experiences of hope are often the stories I\u2019m grasping to be able to tell, and I know people are grasping to be able to tell, but that we see in the world where people are living that agency. And building the kinds of communities that we need to resist the injustice that has sunk so deeply into our world. I hope that we can learn to tell those stories better. I hope that we can learn to see that dignity that\u2019s in all of us, that divinity that comes when we organize together, when we meet each other face-to-face, and even, sometimes, through a chat room. How to tell those stories? How to hold up those moments where we find our agency and our ability to make a change? That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for, and that\u2019s what I hope, more than anything, to contribute.
