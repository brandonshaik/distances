  "fullText": "\u201CI grew up a witness\u201D Mike Rose writes, \u201Cto the intelligence of the waitress in motion, the reflective welder, the strategy of the guy on the assembly line. This, then, is something I know: the thought it takes to do physical work.\u201D In all our debates about standardized testing, the information economy, and the future of liberal arts education, we may risk too narrow a view of the way the physical, the human, and the cognitive blend in all kinds of learning and in all work that matters. Mike Rose\u2019s expansive wisdom could enlarge our civic imagination on big subjects at the heart of who we are \u2014 schooling, social class, and the deepest meaning of vocation. You and I both know people who are doing work that the culture at large from a distance would say is really meaningful and they\u2019re miserable. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. They\u2019re as unhappy as can be. You know, the miserable lawyer. The unhappy neurosurgeon. Right? Meaningfulness is a more fluid and rich and variable concept I think than we tend to imagine. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Mike Rose is a professor in the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. He grew up in Pennsylvania, among Italian immigrants. His father was chronically ill, and his mother supported their family as a waitress. How would you start to tell the story of how and when you became attentive to what you would call \u201Cthe spirit of education\u201D, maybe you wouldn\u2019t have called it that then, but what you now think of as the essence of education. That\u2019s a lovely question. And you\u2019re right, I wouldn\u2019t have talked about it that way at the time. I\u2019ve got to say that it began for me in my senior year in high school. You know, I didn\u2019t do so well in school, I could read, which was really fortunate, since that\u2019s the sort of meta tool. So I could read, and that was immensely helpful, but I was horrible in mathematics. I couldn\u2019t diagram a sentence if you held a gun to my head, I just didn\u2019t do that well in school. And then when I got to high school, I ended up in the vocational training \u2014 those were the days when schools were pretty rigidly tracked \u2014 and then a remarkable thing happened. Somebody found out that somewhere along the line my entrance tests to high school got confused with somebody else whose last name was Rose. And so, suddenly in my junior year, I find myself in this college preparatory track, and I was as ill-prepared for that as I was for playing the defensive tackle on the football team, you know? I was so in the deep end of the pool. And so I drifted through all that, and then in my senior year, I had the sheer dumb luck of getting an English teacher who himself had just left Columbia University, and came out west, and wanted to teach for a few years. And that was Jack McFarland right? And that was Jack McFarland. And so suddenly after all those years drifting around and not knowing what was up, we hit this guy who is giving us every other week a new book to read, starting with Homer, and working his way down to Hemingway. And for some reason, some complex set of reasons, it caught my fancy, the guy just caught me. And so when you ask me the question about when did I begin to think about or understand, in some kind of way, this spirit of education, it had to be there. Again, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have expressed it like that, but there was something about what he was doing with us that caught me in a very deep and powerful way. If I think about the culture of my childhood, in terms of education, I was very much in the thick of an anti-intellectual frontier America, and you also have written a lot about that strain which takes different forms in probably different regions of the country, in different socioeconomic groups \u2014 but talk to me about that as something that is a tension in our culture and even in the culture of our schools. These tensions that you\u2019re talking about, they go far back in the Republic and it gets expressed in different ways. Right? Sometimes it\u2019s expressed in terms of rural or country or mid-America versus the city or East Coast elites or East Coast institutions. Right? So there\u2019s that sort of country/city tension that runs through our literature back into the 19th century. And, in fact, Sarah Palin was masterful at playing those guitar chords in her speeches. So there\u2019s that kind of tension. And hand in glove, there\u2019s another tension that I understand and it\u2019s the tension between book learning and practical experience. Yes. And I think that was the tension that you were most acutely aware of when you were growing up. Yes. And it\u2019s a very interesting tension to me. And, again, it goes way back in our history. And part of what Hofstadter chronicles is the way the country shifts over time from more and more of a weight and credibility given to practical experience, the practical man, the wisdom gained through living, versus the certification of schools, bookwork, intellectual endeavor, certification, all of that sort of thing. And we have moved into the 20th century, and we\u2019ve become a culture of certification, a culture of school-based credibility and training, and all of that sort of thing. So what you used to learn in the apprentice shop you now learn in a classroom. So there\u2019s this whole cultural shift, but the tensions remain. Somewhere I quote my cousin, and I love this little saying because it captures so much. He likes to say all the time, \u201CYou know, it took a guy with a college degree to screw this up and a guy with a high school degree to fix it.\u201D On Being Right. That\u2019s part of the American spirit too. It really is. It is, isn\u2019t it? And, you know, Krista, I\u2019ve got to say, given how I grew up, and what I experienced as I grew up, I understand the legitimacy of the point of view that gives credibility to hands-on experience versus the abstractions that can so often emerge from just learning through books. And, of course, what I strive for in my own work, and with students who I\u2019ve worked for, I strive to try and figure out how you blend these strands. Because, again, I\u2019m very uncomfortable with binaries, with simple dichotomies, with it\u2019s either this or it\u2019s that. Right, right. There\u2019s above the neck learning and below the neck learning we talk about. Right. And then we strip the intellectual out of physical work, and we strip the physical out of intellectual activity. Yeah. Right. And in fact I think what happens in most kinds of good work, whether it\u2019s styling hair or neurosurgery, is that you get this blend of formal training with hands-on experience, and the folks who best blend those strands are the people who are usually the best at what they do. Hmm. One of your books is The Mind at Work, and let\u2019s start there. We can talk about education and intelligence in the many forms it takes but there are these beautiful sentences. I think this may be the beginning of your book. \u201CI grew up a witness to the intelligence of the waitress in motion, the reflective welder, the strategy of the guy on the assembly line. This then is something I know: the thought it takes to do physical work.\u201D I\u2019m sure many people have made those kinds of observations but, again, I think it\u2019s something we don\u2019t sit down and formulate , speak out loud, or read on the page like that. I guess I had no choice but to see things that way, right? As I grew up, my father and I, until he just became too sick to get out of the house, we would take the bus downtown and go spend time with my mother while she worked. We\u2019d sit at the counter or \u2014 there was this back booth. In most restaurants there will be some little back booth where the cooks and the waitresses will take their breaks. So we\u2019d sit there and I\u2019d watch. I\u2019d watch her work. I mean, even to a child\u2019s eye it was just such an impressive display of competence. Yeah . Well, and then you later interviewed your mother for this book. I did. I did. So tell me about what you learned then, or what you were maybe able to put words around about the mind at work in her waitressing. Right. All of this training that I had gotten in the university, in graduate school, all this training in cognitive psychology and thinking about how people think, and all of that, it was this wonderful opportunity to take all that and bring it right back home, right? Bring it right back to the kinds of work that all my forebears did, working in restaurants, or machinists and welders in the railroad yards, or working in the automobile factories when the automobile industry was booming. And so what I was able to articulate better through bringing this formal knowledge of cognitive science to bear on my mother\u2019s experience, let\u2019s say, I was able to make connections between her work and this lofty research taking place in research laboratories, right? Right. And in a way test that research with the lived experience of her work in a restaurant. So, for example, it helped me understand the complex memory work that waitresses, waiters in restaurants are able to do, especially in these big chains that have big rushes at breakfast and lunch where you see these folks just zooming through places. And they always seem \u2014 the good ones, they seem to know who gets the fried shrimp. They know who gets the chef salad. They know who gets that omelet. So they\u2019re remembering that stuff. They\u2019re remembering things about what the regulars like or don\u2019t like. So all the memory work. And then all the play of attention and vigilance, the constant kind of scanning of the workspace. Who needs what, what\u2019s going on, somebody dropped a fork, somebody else is waving. Oops, the manager\u2019s seating some new people over there. Oops, you know what? It\u2019s taking too long for that shrimp plate to come out, I\u2019d better check on that. So there\u2019s all that kind of stuff going on. When you watch a waitress at rush hour, they seem so economical. They\u2019re zooming through the place but they\u2019re not missing a lick. What\u2019s going on is that they\u2019re prioritizing on the fly the different things they have to do. If you don\u2019t cluster these tasks together you\u2019re going to run yourself ragged, and so there\u2019s a real efficiency that emerges in the middle of the action, on the fly. You wrote about all kinds of work, that again we think of as physical labor, and this is another experience we have all the time but we don\u2019t always name, is how there\u2019s giftedness in every occupation, in a plumber or a painter or a waitress or a hairstylist, certainly. It is that mix of skill, and intelligence, and sophisticated knowledge, and judgment, and instinct that\u2019s been honed by practice. Especially in this high-tech era where we are so captivated by electronic media, by the continued breakthroughs in technologies of all kinds. And absolutely, those are worth celebrating and worth marveling at. But what unfortunately happens is that our marvel at these new technologies plays into this unfortunate trend in the West of looking down on those who work with their hands. Right. A tendency that goes all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, to consider the person who works with his or her hands\u2026 Manual labor. \u2026manual labor of any kind to be of lesser quality, to be soul-shriveling, to be \u2014 the Greeks even talked about it making one unfit for civic participation. So this tendency has been around for such a long time, and it\u2019s so undemocratic to my mind, right? Right, right. And so I wanted to try and turn all that on its head and say, alright let\u2019s take these frameworks of intelligence, and cognition, and analyzing tasks that usually we reserve for white-collar folks, professional folks, biographies of scientists, and entrepreneurs and what-not \u2014 let\u2019s see what happens when we take these lenses and turn them on folks who comprise the backbone of the economy and of what makes the world run, right? Physical, manual labor, service work. And what happened as I did that was just this revelation of what you were talking about: the knowledge base you have to build to be good at anything from styling hair, to plumbing, to welding, to bricklaying, and what-not. And the deployment of that knowledge, and solving problems with it, and troubleshooting, and making decisions on the fly. And it was just such a wonderful experience. What an excursion it was for me to spend this kind of time with these folks I\u2019ve grown up with, but spend this time with them, and using thats lens to kind of highlight and underscore the richness of their work, which just so often gets dismissed. Until \u2014 something goes wrong with our plumbing. Right. And then suddenly this is the most important person in the world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with educator Mike Rose. You know there\u2019s a question that you pose repeatedly in your writing, and I think we\u2019ll come back to it again in this conversation: what kind of education befits a democracy? Which is very resonant with what you just said about how you\u2019ve thought about intelligence and different kinds of work. And when you write about vocational education. I do think that the notion of vocational education has had a bit of a boon in recent years. I mean there is more attention. Yes, yes. Also, as we become globalized I\u2019ve been aware that the United states compares itself to cultures like Japan or Germany, which have very robust vocational education sectors. But something that you\u2019ve pointed out \u2014 and I don\u2019t know, I mean I lived in Germany for awhile, I\u2019m not sure that this is true in those other cultures \u2014 but I think it\u2019s true here that, even as we try to take this notion of vocational education more seriously, we strip out a sense of the cognitive and civic aspect \u2014 precisely what you\u2019re describing. And you say the way that we talk about these students, who are not going to go to university but are going to be vocationally trained, is inflected with a sense of their limitation. Mm-hmm. You know, if you want to look at a hundred-year institutional case study, of what can go wrong when a culture holds to these kinds of diminished notions of the intelligence involved in everyday work, you look at vocational education. Because when you go back and look at the origins of voc-ed in the 1910s and \u201820s, you begin to see that even at the beginnings of it there were these notions afoot. Like, for example, well, there are children who are \u201Chand minded.\u201D That was a phrase that they used \u2014 \u201Chand minded.\u201D And then there are those who are \u201Cabstract minded.\u201D Now, these were\u2026 I\u2019m not sure either one of those sounds great. Which option is better? Yeah. Well, getting back to something that\u2019s dear to me is that, hopefully, all of us, to some degree or another, are both of those things. Right. Right? But so imagine then you begin this enterprise that\u2019s called vocational education with notions like that, that separate whole huge chunks of young humanity into one category or the other. And, hey, no big surprise, the kids who are clumped into that hand-minded group tended to be poor kids, immigrant kids, kids of color. Right? And those who were moved or categorized as being the abstract-minded folks, well, gee, no big surprise, they tended to be white and here for generations and come from more well-to-do families. John Dewey, our great American philosopher, called this \u201Csocial predestination.\u201D So at the very origins, the very beginnings of voc-ed as it manifested itself through most of the 20th century, you had these kinds of ideas about students, about intelligence, about work, about mental activity. So no wonder we ran into this situation where the vocational track ended up being, for many kids, a dumping ground. Right. Now, having said that, I don\u2019t want to deny for a minute that there weren\u2019t great voc-ed teachers all the way along the way. There were, and people learned things. So I don\u2019t want to be dismissive of the enterprise. Right. But when you look at the whole trajectory of it, no wonder it ended up creating within the school this place where the intelligence of the work being done was not foregrounded, where kids at a crucial transitional point in their development are categorized as being not that bright, and the kind of curriculum they got, particularly outside of the workshops, was just in many cases not that stimulating and not that inventive. Now, you\u2019re right, in the last decade or two, there\u2019s been a lot of money and a lot of attention paid to trying to revitalize voc-ed and to revitalize the natural intellectual content that lies within this work. You see that is part of some of these good programs that have sprung up in the last decade. You think they are acknowledging this intellectual\u2026 Yes. They are. And they\u2019re trying to break this awful 100-year-old barrier that separates the quote/unquote \u201Cvocational\u201D from the quote/unquote \u201Cacademic.\u201D That\u2019s another one of these splits. I\u2019ve been talking about these dichotomies and binaries, right? That\u2019s another one of these splits I think that have gotten us into trouble. Mm-hmm. You know, something that concerns me is when people talk about meaningful work. It\u2019s one of those phrases that\u2019s really out there in our vocabulary now as people question some of the materialism that\u2019s surrounded us or think about what are we as whole human beings in this spiritual aspect. And you will hear people talk about the importance for human beings to feel that we\u2019re doing something meaningful and purposeful with our lives. And I think that\u2019s a fact. But what concerns me \u2014 people will often say to me, I can\u2019t tell you how many people will say, \u201CYou know, you must have the best job in the world, right?\u201D But what they think is that I spend my time having these wonderful conversations. And, you know, I am incredibly grateful for my job, but what I say then is, \u201CYes, but it\u2019s a job. I mean, there\u2019s a huge amount of work and a huge amount that\u2019s not romantic that goes into this.\u201D By the same token, I worry when we then romanticize certain kinds of work as meaningful that are more overtly meaningful, right? I mean, there are companies that are producing products that are overtly more meaningful than other companies, right? But I feel like we lose sense of all the different ways in which work is meaningful. And to me, you know, working to put food on the table for your family to eat also makes that work meaningful in some sense. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of throwing that out because this is something that concerns me \u2014 that this is another way we might have of making people either feel good or bad about the work they do and their identity. You know, I\u2019m really so glad you\u2019re bringing this up because what you\u2019re putting your finger on is that the use of this notion of meaningful work, which is a lovely notion. And as you say, what\u2019s the bottom-line thing that drives our lives? It\u2019s to have some kind of meaningful life, to not just be a blip and that\u2019s it, you know? So that\u2019s all well and good. But what I like about what you\u2019re doing here is you\u2019re putting your finger on the fact that the way people talk about meaningful work can inadvertently have a very elitist tinge to it. Yes. So let\u2019s then bust this notion of meaningfulness open, right? Let\u2019s think about this. As you say, regardless of the kind of work, to be able to support a family or put food on the table, that\u2019s meaningful. Yeah. For my mother, doing this kind of work, which was very hard work and took its toll on her physically. But it was a way for her \u2014 and she talked about this a lot \u2014 to be out in the world. She saw that job as a kind of social sphere, a social field. She talked all the time about being among the public and what that meant to her. So for her, then, in the midst of this difficult work and difficult circumstances, there was great meaning in the kind of social dimension of it, right? Yeah. Conversely, you and I both know people who are doing work that the culture at large from a distance would say is really meaningful, and they\u2019re miserable. Really ennobling. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know? They\u2019re as unhappy as can be. You know, the miserable lawyer. The unhappy neurosurgeon. Right? There\u2019s those two. So meaningfulness is a more fluid and rich and variable concept I think than we tend to imagine. Right. It\u2019s not in a job title. It\u2019s not \u2014 either positively or negatively. No. We have excerpts of Mike Rose\u2019s writings at onbeing.org. While you\u2019re there, you can also listen to this show again, share it with others, and subscribe to our podcast. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation on work, education, and civic imagination with Mike Rose. He\u2019s an educator and author at UCLA. His perspective suggests new ways forward on hard subjects that drive to the heart of who we are: literacy, schooling, class, and the deepest meaning of vocation. We\u2019ve been talking about his research into the often-ignored intelligence in service professions and physical labor, jobs like that of his mother who was a waitress for over 35 years. Mike Rose was the first person in his own family to attend college, and he speaks often about a handful of teachers who made all the difference for him, shaping his essential understanding of good teaching. \u201CSuch teachers don\u2019t merely inspire thought,\u201D he says; \u201Cthey give students a sense of what opportunity feels like.\u201D So let me ask you a question now that I thought I might ask you earlier in the conversation. You talked about Jack McFarland, this English teacher who set your mind on fire. There again is an image that\u2019s both tactile, and visual, and cognitive. And then you write about going to Loyola college. It was only very recently that you\u2019d even thought that college would be something that was in your life. And you had other teachers, and you wrote these were mentors who collectively \u201Cgave me the best sort of liberal education: the kind longed-for in the stream of blue-ribbon reports on the humanities that now cross my desk.\u201D What is your imagination about the best kind of liberal education that you both received, and that you think about and work on now? Right. I should say that that college that I went to was the only place I could get into. And I got in there because Jack McFarland, my high school English teacher, had gone there himself seven or eight years before, and he knew some folks there. So he went over and talked to them and he got me in as a probationary student. So, there I was, and boy, once more I found myself at a loss. My freshman year didn\u2019t go so well and at one point I was getting close to not fulfilling the terms of the probation. Let me just say by the way, an aside here, I\u2019m telling you a lot of personal stories. But I hope that what comes through is that these things that I experience, or other folks I talk about, are commonplace. I mean, something that I see happening throughout my career in working in different kinds of preparatory programs is the phenomenon of the young person who does well in high school, or does well in part of high school anyway, is the kind of pride in their neighborhood, and then they come to college and run right up against a brick wall because it\u2019s a whole other ballgame, right? And it\u2019s larger and it\u2019s anonymous and there may not be a system of support there. So that same thing happened to me. Well, again, sheer dumb luck, I managed to get some professors, mostly in English. And starting in my sophomore year, they really devoted themselves to their teaching and their students, and they taught me a lot of things about history or literature, how to write, how to write better. They certainly did that. But they were also people whose office door was open and who would spend a lot of time talking about the material you were learning and would work over a piece of your writing. I can\u2019t tell you how many times, Krista, I\u2019d be sitting at the elbow of one of these folks, and they were going over a paper yet once again and saying, \u201CYou know, try saying it this way. Try it like this.\u201D So all of that kind of personal attention, that embodiment of knowledge in a relationship. And it seems to me that that finally is what good teaching is all about. And that\u2019s all the way from good teaching in kindergarten through graduate school, through medical school, through apprenticeships, through the carpenter\u2019s workshop, you name it. That somehow or another, skill and knowledge is integrated into some kind of a human connection, in that it was a humane humanities education. It was certainly rich cognitively, but it was that interplay of the cognitive and the social, the personal and the cognitive. Something you also have concluded with your work with remedial education, and that you describe in your own experience at Loyola, was how what worked wasn\u2019t dumbing it down for you and then making it really simple. It was also about high expectations, but then supporting that. Right? So expecting you to write papers, but then helping you get it right. But I wonder also if that relationship piece isn\u2019t what makes that possible. Absolutely but you bring up another point, and I really want to touch on it. We\u2019ve been talking about these assumptions in the culture about intelligence and ability. And one way we\u2019ve been talking about it is that there are these unfortunate strands in the culture that connect physical work with low intelligence. Well there\u2019s another strand, and that unfortunate strand has woven its way through remedial, or developmental, or basic skills education. The assumption is if someone can\u2019t do something, then it indicates some deficiency, some deficit. And our tendency has been then to take whatever task it is \u2014 whether it\u2019s mathematics, or writing, or reading \u2014 and break it down into the tiniest little morsels. Right. But it seems to me that this approach we\u2019ve taken has just not been that productive. So what do you do? Well what you do do is you create conditions where, right from the jump, you\u2019re giving people intellectually engaging material. And even if their skills are so poor they can\u2019t read them, you read it for them. You get the conversation going around this question in political science, or in sociology, or in a piece of literature. You bring in concepts. Maybe you have to scale things down a bit. Maybe you even take a piece of reading and you edit it down. Maybe you rewrite it even, so that it\u2019s a bit simpler to use. But the point is that you throw people into the activity and then, along the way, you address the bits and pieces. OK, right. You don\u2019t let those go by the wayside, but you integrate them into a meaningful engagement that makes them feel like, \u201Cyou know what, I\u2019m in the middle of something here that I haven\u2019t been in before.\u201D Something that reading your work, reading your stories about yourself, and all the many people you\u2019ve worked with \u2013 what it reminded me of, what it kind of immersed me in, were my own memories of those moments when my mind came to life, right? I think you use the word \u201Cyearning\u201D in your writing. It\u2019s an ache as much as it\u2019s a thrill. You actually \u2014 I meant to bring this with me and I didn\u2019t \u2014 but you have a paragraph from a book, I did write the title, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science, which was assigned to you in those early days when you didn\u2019t know what you could achieve. And it was this paragraph that you had to go over and over and over again and underline. Where it made your brain hurt and it felt so good. Right? Because it somehow opened possibility. And what this also makes me think is how precious these educational experiences are, because when we get into what my father would call \u201CReal Life,\u201D you know \u2014 capital \u201CR\u201D capital \u201CL\u201D, you get to be present to that a lot. That\u2019s a great thing about your work, I think. Those are powerful moments, and they can be defining moments. When you talk to people about their memories of school, memories of teachers \u2014 certainly, you\u2019ll get some bad memories and awful teachers and that sort of thing. That\u2019s to be expected. But when people talk about either falling in love with a discipline, falling in love with a subject matter, or a teacher who made a difference, it\u2019s interesting how often they\u2019ll remember a moment. You know, they\u2019ll remember something that they read, or something that somebody said, or something someone did for them. Those moments are powerful, and I think they live on in memory for a reason, because they help shape who we are and where we go. Those moments, as you put it, of possibility. And you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been really fortunate to be close by as those moments erupt. And I guess the point I want to make about those moments, and quote/unquote \u201Cremedial,\u201D or basic-skilled education, or students who haven\u2019t done so well in school \u2014 again this is another unfortunate binary that we fall into. I think a lot of folks would just assume automatically that those moments happen all the time with kids who have good educations, and go to good schools, and have good teachers. They also happen all the time, and are always at the ready, with folks who are even coming in with the most basic of skills and the longest way to go. It happens if you can create the right kinds of environments for them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a conversation on work, learning, and civic imagination, with educator Mike Rose. You make a very interesting point about how our education across recent decades has been so shaped by psychometrics, and tests, and measurements. And you make a really interesting proposition \u2014 and this applies very much to the college-bound \u2014 that a high score on a lot of these tests we use \u2014 like let\u2019s take the SAT \u2014 does tell us something we can work with, but a low score tells us less, is less useful. Yeah. You said it\u2019s a measure that only works at the upper end of the scale. That\u2019s really interesting. Yeah. I really think that\u2019s true. It\u2019s like we have a ruler that is very precise for half of its width or length. Right? I\u2019m interested in those folks that don\u2019t do well on those kinds of tests, that don\u2019t do well on the standard IQ test, or don\u2019t do so well on the SAT test, let\u2019s say. Because, again, what I want to know is what they know that\u2019s not being reflected in that test. Yeah. Or, another angle on it is, I want to find out more about what didn\u2019t happen in their educations that made them do poorly on that test, or in their life experience. So let\u2019s take the IQ test. OK That\u2019s a kind of standard instrument in our culture for the last century. If someone does well on an IQ test, that certainly tells us something, right? They\u2019ve got some smarts; there\u2019s no doubt about it. Right. But think of the folks who might not do so well on those kinds of tests because they didn\u2019t have a lot of formal schooling \u2014 and everybody admits that there\u2019s a direct correlation between amount of formal schooling and how well you do on tests like that. There\u2019s an intimate connection between those two things. So they didn\u2019t have a lot of formal schooling. They haven\u2019t had a lot of experience taking those kinds of tests. Right. They also don\u2019t invest as much in them, right? I mean those of us who have been through a ton of schooling, we\u2019ve been socialized to know that when one of those things appears in front of us, we better try our damnedest to do well on it. Right. Right. So there\u2019s all kinds of reasons through which we can explain somebody not doing so well on a test like that, reasons other than some intellectual deficiency. So then I say, I\u2019m interested in, well, gee, what happens when we go out into the world with this person and we watch them work, let\u2019s say. Or we watch them raise kids. Or we watch them figure out how to make their way through the day or some complicated social relationships. What emerges that bespeaks of intelligence? What goes on right under our noses that bespeaks of some kind of smarts? So the plumber who reaches up inside of the wall of an old building where he cannot see and he can only feel, and through feeling around the structures in there, feeling the rust, feeling moisture if there\u2019s any, feeling the way the thing is structured \u2014 he\u2019s visualizing what\u2019s back there that he can\u2019t see and then bringing a knowledge base to bear on trying to figure out what the problem may be. Think of what a complex set of mental operations are involved in that. Or the hairstylist who is presented with someone who comes in and they have a botched dye job, let\u2019s say. And the stylist \u2014 and this woman said this to me when I was watching her work \u2014 she said, \u201CThe first thing I asked myself is what was that previous stylist trying to accomplish?\u201D So what an interesting question to ask. Right. And what an interesting problem-solving road that takes her down. Now, those kinds of things are not going to be picked up on an IQ instrument. They\u2019re not structured to get to that stuff. But those are certainly manifestations of intelligence. Right. We hear a lot about and you\u2019ve written a lot about how we\u2019ve reduced this reductionist approach that we were just getting at a bit, you know, testing. Standardized testing. But I\u2019d like to ask you, what do you see when you look at the big picture of what\u2019s happening with education? Well, you know, unfortunately, I see that we are locked into a way of thinking about school reform that suffers from so much of what else we\u2019ve been talking about in this conversation, and that\u2019s a kind of a reductive approach to schooling, to learning, to teaching. But doesn\u2019t everybody know that it\u2019s reductive at this point? I mean, this is what I can\u2019t figure out. Yeah. It\u2019s a runaway train, I think. We\u2019re so locked into a way of solving the \u201Ceducational problem,\u201D quote/unquote. \u201CNo Child Left Behind,\u201D which everybody wants to distance themselves from now, but it did pick up on something in the culture. And that is a belief that there are these kinds of technocratic ways that we can measure with precision what people are learning, how well teachers are teaching, and that we can make consequential judgments based on these measures. And the technocratic ways are, of course, these high-stakes standardized tests. Right. Now, unfortunately, a lot of that same kind of thinking \u2014 I mean, the particulars are being tweaked, but that same orientation is carrying over into this new administration. Again, I think, I\u2019m not saying these are bad people, right? Mm-hmm. But I\u2019m just saying that it is a way of thinking that makes sense in a technocratic managerial society, which is what we live in. But I think the unfortunate thing is that if you really know about schools, and you really know about teaching, you get in close to classrooms, you watch this very intimate and difficult and complex thing called teaching and learning, you see what a far remove a standardized test score is from the cognitive, and emotional, and social give and take in the classroom. I contrast that with a journey that I took around the country a while back, spending four years when I could get the time, visiting good public school classrooms \u2014 many of them in poor or modest income districts, many of them rural, some urban, spread all across the United States. And the kinds of things that I saw there, and the kinds of qualities of good teaching, and the kind of learning that goes on, I think \u2014 can in part, some little piece of it, some aspect of it \u2014 can certainly be picked up by the kinds of testing regime that we put in place, but certainly not all. And certainly not the kinds of things we\u2019ve been talking about. My hope would be that we get to the point where we begin to look for much richer ways of thinking about teaching and learning, and richer ways to try and assess what\u2019s going on in schools and classrooms. Because here\u2019s the good thing about \u201CNo Child Left Behind,\u201D and the good thing about the current impulse, is that it is admitting and putting a bright light on the fact that there are a lot of kids who don\u2019t do well in our schools. And those kids tend to be \u2014 tend to be \u2014 poor kids, immigrant kids, children of color, and that we absolutely have to do something. This is a moral, ethical question of equity. We have to do something to do better with those children. You ask a rhetorical question in your writing sometimes: \u201Cwhen was the last time you heard a really moving speech about education?\u201D And I think about this in other contexts, as well. I mean, the word \u201Ceducation\u201D itself has become laden with \u2014 the word \u201Ceducation\u201D doesn\u2019t inspire. I mean, it should. But you almost interchangeably use phrases like \u201Chuman possibility.\u201D I mean, reading you made me wonder if we just also need to think about the language we use. Another question you ask is \u201Cwhat kind of education befits a democracy?\u201D So what is the answer you would give at this point? Well, the language we use is hugely important, and it gets to what we\u2019re talking about here. That if the language we use is a strictly instrumental, functionalist language, that says, \u201CWe go to school, we send our kids to school, because we want to compete in a 21st-century economy and therefore, we\u2019re going to hit these subjects hard and we\u2019re not going to hit these other subjects like music or art or literature or even social studies.\u201D If that\u2019s the language we\u2019re using and that\u2019s the way we think about the purpose of schooling, it\u2019s going to dramatically narrow what happens in schools. It\u2019s going to change the way we think of what it means to be educated, and that has implications for, I think, who we are as a society. Right. So what kind of a language should we use in a democratic society? Certainly a language that includes the economic motive. Absolutely. Of course. But that braids that motive in with all the other reasons that actually historically in our country we\u2019ve talked about as well. The civic motive. We send kids to school to become civic beings. We sent kids to school to learn how to solve problems with each other. Children go to school because their parents want to help them develop into better people. They want them to find passions. They want them to learn how to learn. And what about in a democracy learning how to speak up when you think something is not right? Or learning to take a risk. You know, in this kind of test-based world that students grow up in, you\u2019re penalized if you take a risk, but yet just about any intellectual breakthrough of any kind that you\u2019ll study has seen that it\u2019s been a path of breakthrough and failure. Right. Of risk, of going beyond. So where in all of this are children encouraged to take intellectual risks? What kinds of classrooms are created that allow that? Do you see what I mean when I say the language we use either \u2026 Yeah, is essential. It either closes down or opens up the richness with which we think about schooling in a democracy. Because in fact what you see when you travel through all these communities, and you talk to parents, and you watch these teachers who work so hard, and you spend time with these kids, is you get a sense of this immense rich thing that a classroom can be: a place of both learning subject matter, but of learning how to exist in a public space and how to have this feeling, this sense, that you matter. And that your mind matters. And that this is a place that\u2019s safe and respectful, and where I can take chances and I can learn something. And that can have an effect on who I\u2019m going to be.
