  "fullText": "Fr. Greg Boyle makes amazingly winsome connections between things like service and delight, and compassion and awe. Amazing because he works in an urban setting others describe in terms of crime and despair. He landed as an idealistic young Jesuit in a gang-heavy neighborhood of Los Angeles over two decades ago. Now he heads Homeboy Industries, which employs former gang members in a constellation of businesses from screen printing to a farmers market to a bakery. An op-ed in The Los Angeles Times said of Homeboy Industries: \u201CHow much bleaker and meaner would LA be without it?\u201D Fr. Greg says service is not an end in itself but a beginning towards finding real kinship with others. It\u2019s in this story he tells, for example, about giving a blessing to a kid named Louie. I said, \u201CYou know, Louie, I\u2019m proud to know you. And my life is richer because you came into it. When you were born, the world became a better place. And I\u2019m proud to call you my son, even though,\u201D \u2014 and I don\u2019t know why I decided to add this part \u2014 \u201Cat times you can really be a huge pain in the ass.\u201D And he looks up at me and he smiles and he says, \u201CThe feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201D And suddenly \u2014 kinship so quickly. You\u2019re not sort of this delivery system. But maybe I return him to himself, but there is no doubt that he\u2019s returned me to myself. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Fr. Greg Boyle first became known to a wide audience in the 1990s when a book was written about him called G-Dog and the Homeboys. In 2010, he wrote his own very moving memoir, Tattoos on the Heart. In addition to Homeboy Industries, Fr. Greg\u2019s work with young men and women also includes free services like GED classes, life counseling, and tattoo removal. I interviewed Greg Boyle at the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in the summer of 2012. I want us to talk, obviously, about what you do, but really focus in on the \u201Cwhy\u201D of it and on what these experiences have worked in you and how they\u2019ve formed your sense of who God is and what it means to be human. But first of all, tell us how you came to your call to be a Jesuit. First of all, it\u2019s so great to be here. And I\u2019m so honored to be in a conversation with you. I\u2019m a big fan, though I do have a recurring nightmare that I\u2019m interviewed by Krista Tippett and I\u2019m found shallow and lacking faith. This is way better than the actual nightmare I have. Well, I was educated by Jesuits, so I \u2014 for me, they were always sort of this combo burger of absolute hilarity and joy and the most fun people to be around. And they were prophetic. So, this was during the time of the Vietnam War. So we\u2019d laugh a lot, and I\u2019d go with them to protesting the war. So the combination of the prophetic and the hilarious \u2014 I loved that. So I thought, boy, I\u2019ll have what they\u2019re having, you know? So that\u2019s what I did. It\u2019s not very deep, but that\u2019s kind of \u2014 the reasons you join an organization like the Society of Jesus aren\u2019t the reasons you stay. But that kind of was my initial hook. Right. Why did you stay? Tell me that. I got a feeling you might ask. Again, it\u2019s la compa\u00F1\u00EDa de Jes\u00FAs is kind of what St. Ignatius called the thing. So it\u2019s about being in companionship with Jesus. St. Ignatius, in his spiritual exercises, has a meditation called \u201CThe Two Standards.\u201D And in it, he says very simply, \u201CSee Jesus standing in the lowly place.\u201D It\u2019s not about saluting a set of beliefs necessary, it\u2019s about walking with Jesus and being a companion. And I haven\u2019t found anything that\u2019s brought me more life or joy than standing with Jesus, but also with the particularity of standing in the lowly place, with the easily despised and the readily left out, and with the demonized so that the demonizing will stop, and with the disposable so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away. And I find the fullness of life in trying to, as best I can in my own way, to stand there. So that particular place where the Jesuits took you in 1986, is that right? Is to the Dolores Mission? Which at that time \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this is still true \u2014 was the poorest parish in the city and had the highest concentration of gang activity in the world at that time. And there\u2019s so much grief and so much heartbreak in these kids\u2019 lives and in the stories that you tell. And yet, you always come back again and again to talking in this way, that spiritually, theologically, this is not so much about helping others \u2014 I\u2019m saying that \u2014 but this is fundamentally about our common call to delight in one another. I think that\u2019s very unexpected language. Well, Dorothy Day, I think, she quotes Ruskin when she always talks about the duty to delight, and I think it\u2019s right to see it as a duty because you have to be absolutely conscious of it. But it\u2019s really a delighting that enters into full kinship with each other. I\u2019m greatly privileged in my life to have known Cesar Chavez, who was an extraordinary leader of a movement, but was also one of the best listeners I\u2019d ever known. He could just \u2014 you were the only person who existed if you were having a conversation with him. But I remember once a reporter had commented to him and said, \u201CWow, these farm workers, they sure love you.\u201D And Cesar just shrugged and smiled and he said, \u201CThe feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201D And that\u2019s what you hope for. I\u2019m not the great healer and that gang member over there is in need of my exquisite healing. The truth is, it\u2019s mutual and that, as much as we are called to bridge the distance that exists between us, we have to acknowledge that there\u2019s a distance even in service. A service provider, you\u2019re the service recipient and you want to bridge even that so that you can get to this place of utter mutuality. And I think that\u2019s where the place of delight is, that I\u2019ve learned everything of value really in the last 25 years from precisely the people who you think are on the receiving end of my gifts and talent and wisdom, but quite the opposite. It\u2019s mutual. I always like hearing people tell about the things they did that didn\u2019t work out on the way to the things that they know. And it\u2019s very interesting. One of the ways you tried to serve when you first arrived there was you were going to be a peacemaker, right? You were going to make truce between these warring gangs. And you found that, in fact, that which maybe seemed obvious wasn\u2019t right. Well, you know, a lot of \u2014 anything worth doing is worth failing at, I think. So it seemed sensible to me. And we have these Pyrrhic victories of, \u201CLet\u2019s agree not to shoot into each other\u2019s houses.\u201D I mean, that seems kind of not much of a victory. Then we\u2019d have ceasefires and truces and peace treaties. And it was a lot of shuttle diplomacy where I\u2019d actually write up a kind of thing. One side would sign it, the other side would sign it, and it would work for a time. But if you work with gangs, you provide oxygen to gangs. And that\u2019s not a good thing, and I can see that now. One of the realizations you said you made out of that is that peacemaking requires conflict. And while there\u2019s lots of violence between gangs, there\u2019s not conflict that you can define like you can with a war. Yeah, it\u2019s difficult because I\u2019m sort of the dissenting voice, I think, in the country at the moment when it comes to this thing. And sometimes people will say to you, \u201CWell, how can you be against peacemaking?\u201D Well, obviously, I\u2019m not against peacemaking. But I\u2019m old-fashioned. I think peacemaking requires conflict, and it\u2019s important to say that there is no conflict in gang violence. There\u2019s violence, but there\u2019s no conflict. So it\u2019s not about anything. So you want to understand what language is gang violence speaking? That\u2019s important to me. It\u2019s about a lethal absence of hope. It\u2019s about kids who can\u2019t imagine a future for themselves. It\u2019s about kids who aren\u2019t seeking anything when they join a gang. It\u2019s about the fact that they\u2019re always fleeing something, always, without exception. So it shifts the way you see things. Somebody, Bertrand Russell or somebody, said, \u201CIf you want to change the world, change the metaphor.\u201D And that\u2019s kind of how we want to \u2014 I think we need to proceed in something like this. So if you think it\u2019s the Middle East, you\u2019re quite mistaken. If you think it\u2019s Northern Ireland, wrong again. It\u2019s about kids who\u2019ve ceased to care. So you want to infuse young people with hope when it seems that hope is foreign. And as you tell their stories, it\u2019s hard to imagine where they would draw hope from. I mean, a lot of them \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I mean, it\u2019s not just that many of them have been abandoned or that they come from a single-parent home. The stories that stuck with me were the kid whose father left them on the day of his sixth birthday while they were all waiting to light the candles for his dad to come home. Or the one whose mother literally tortured him because he reminded her so much of his terrible father. There\u2019s drug and violence and incarceration in these kids\u2019 families. I mean, what also occurs to me, though, because you know them, right? You take delight in them and you love them. I think that also gives you a much more \u2014 well, a sense of how the lines between what it means to be an enemy or a friend or a victim or a survivor, how those things blur in real messy human life. Well, lately I\u2019ve been reading the Acts of the Apostles really carefully. And if you start to read it and think it\u2019s kind of a quaint snapshot of the earliest Christian community, that\u2019s one thing. But what if you were to read it as a measure of the health of any community? So you see how they love one another or there is nobody in need in this community, for example. But my favorite one is \u2014 it leaped off the page to me \u2014 and it says, \u201CAnd awe came upon everyone.\u201D So that the measure of our compassion lies not in our service of those on the margins but in our willingness to see ourselves in kinship. And so that means the decided movement towards awe and giant steps away from judgment. So how can we seek really a compassion that can stand in awe at what people have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it? And I think that\u2019s sort of the key here. That\u2019s the place of health in any community, forget Christian community. In any community, that\u2019s how you know that you\u2019re healthy. So recently I gave a talk, a training \u2014 an all-day training to 600 social workers, a training on gangs. I had two homies with me, and one of them was a guy named Jos\u00E9. And he got up \u2014 he\u2019s in his late 20s, and he now works in a substance abuse part of our team, a man in recovery \u2014 had been a heroine addict and gang member and tattooed. And he gets up and he says very offhandedly, \u201CYou know, I guess you could say that my mom and me, we didn\u2019t get along so good. I guess I was six when she looked at me and she said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just kill yourself? You\u2019re such a burden to me.'\u201D Well, the whole audience did what you just did. They gasped, and then he said, \u201CIt\u2019s sounds way worser in Spanish,\u201D he said. And everybody did what you just did. Then he said, \u201CYou know, I guess I was nine when my mom drove me down to the deepest part of Baja California, and she walked me up to an orphanage and she said, \u2018I found this kid.\u2019\u201D And then he said, \u201CI was there 90 days until my grandmother could get out of her \u2014 where she had dumped me and she came and rescued me.\u201D And then he tells the audience, \u201CMy mom beat me every single day. In fact, I had to wear three T-shirts to school every day.\u201D And then he kind of loses the battle with his own tears a little bit. And he says, \u201CI wore three T-shirts well into my adult years because I was ashamed of my wounds. I didn\u2019t want anybody to see them. But now my wounds are my friends. I welcome my wounds. I run my fingers over my wounds.\u201D And then he looks at this crowd, and he says, \u201CHow can I help the wounded if I don\u2019t welcome my own wounds?\u201D And awe came upon everyone because we\u2019re so inclined to kind of judge this kid who went to prison, is tattooed, and is a gang member, and homeless, and a heroine addict, and the list goes on. But he was never seeking anything when he ended up in those places. He was always fleeing the story I just told you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in the Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution with Fr. Greg Boyle, the founder of one of the largest gang intervention programs in the US, Homeboy Industries. So, something I think a lot about is how in this culture we\u2019ve overused and watered down some of the words we need the most, that actually mean the most. Compassion is one of them. Love is another. You talked about this a minute ago. I mean, you started talking about compassion, but I\u2019d like to put some more flesh on those bones of those words. And I wonder if you think about compassion or love \u2014 are there people who come to mind or moments that come to mind that really express what these words have come to mean, lived? Well, if you presume that God is compassionate loving-kindness, all we\u2019re asked to do in the world is to be in the world who God is. And so you\u2019re always trying to\u2026 But that\u2019s huge. Yeah. That\u2019s huge. Yeah, so you\u2019re trying to imitate the kind of God you believe in. You want to move away from whatever is tiny-spirited and judgmental, as I mentioned. But you want to be as spacious as you can be that you can have room for stuff. And love is all there is, and love is all you are. And you want people to recognize the truth of who they are, that they\u2019re exactly what God had in mind when God made them. Alice Miller, who\u2019s the late great child psychologist, talked about we\u2019re all called to be enlightened witnesses. People who, through your kindness and tenderness and focused attent of love, return people to themselves. And in the process, you\u2019re returned to yourself. Like I have a homie named Louie who\u2019s just turned 18, and he\u2019s kind of a difficult kid. He\u2019s exasperating and he\u2019s whiny. And he works for me, although work may be too strong a verb. But homies lately have asked me for blessings, which is odd. It\u2019s like in the last three years. They never \u2014 they always ask me on the street or in my office. They never say, \u201CFather, may I have your blessing?\u201D They always say, \u201CHey, G, give me a bless, yeah?\u201D And they always say it the same way. So, this kid Louie, I\u2019m talking to him, and he\u2019s complaining about something. Finally, at the end of it, he says, \u201CHey, G, give me a bless, yeah?\u201D I said, \u201CSure.\u201D So he comes around to my side of the desk. And he knows the drill, and he bows his head, and I put my hands on his shoulder. Well, his birthday had been two days before, so it gave me an opportunity to say something to him. I said, \u201CYou know, Louie, I\u2019m proud to know you. My life is richer because you came into it. When you were born, the world became a better place. And I\u2019m proud to call you my son, even though,\u201D \u2014 and I don\u2019t know why I decided to add this part \u2014 \u201Cat times you can really be a huge pain in the ass.\u201D And he looks up at me and he smiles and he says, \u201CThe feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201D And suddenly \u2014 kinship so quickly. It\u2019s not \u2014 you\u2019re not sort of this delivery system. But maybe I return him to himself, but there is no doubt that he\u2019s returned me to myself. You use this word \u201Cspacious.\u201D And synonyms for \u201Cspacious\u201D \u2014 they\u2019re all over the place, especially in your memoir when you\u2019re talking about God. The spaciousness of God, the vastness of God, the largeness of God. You quote Hafiz, \u201Cthis Great, Wild God,\u201D God\u2019s limitless magnanimity. That\u2019s very exciting, really emboldening language. But it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a language people would ever reach for themselves if they were shown the statistics about the part of town you minister in or pictures. So how do you think about that gap, that disconnect? Well, I\u2019m a Jesuit, so Ignatius always talks about the God who is always greater. And that is part of the issue whenever you land on a God who\u2019s tiny or judgmental or exacting or concerned with some kind of purity code. And it sort of blows it wide open and knowing that there\u2019s a need to have this blown wide open all the time. And I can remember walking in the projects late at night long ago, and there was this kid, Mario, sitting by himself, 16 years old, just sitting on his little stoop in front of the crummy old projects. So I see him, and I greet him: \u201CHey, how you doing?\u201D And I sit down next to him, and he goes, \u201CIt\u2019s funny that you should show up right now.\u201D I said, \u201CWhy?\u201D \u201CWell, I was just sitting here praying and I said, \u2018God, show me a sign that you\u2019re as great as I think you are,\u2019 and then you showed up.\u201D Well, I just think \u2014 I remember how moved I was by that. And it\u2019s how you enter into the vastness and the spacious place that God holds. But it came by way of knowing that the day won\u2019t ever come when I am as holy as the people I\u2019m called to serve, that the day won\u2019t ever come when I have more courage or am more noble or am closer to God than this 16-year-old gang member sitting alone on his porch. What your ministry so bespeaks is this incarnational heart of Christianity, but that it always comes down to relationship between people, that that\u2019s where we discover God as well. Well, it\u2019s relational, but it\u2019s also \u2014 I think we\u2019re afraid of the incarnation. And part of it, the fear that drives us is that we have to have our sacred in a certain way. It has to be gold-plated and cost of millions and cast of thousands or something, I don\u2019t know. So we\u2019ve wrestled the cup out of Jesus\u2019 hand and we\u2019ve replaced it with a chalice because who doesn\u2019t know that a chalice is more sacred than a cup, never mind that Jesus didn\u2019t use a chalice? A story I tell in the book about a homie who was \u2014 on Christmas Day, I said, \u201CWhat\u2019d you do on Christmas?\u201D And he was an orphan and abandoned and abused by his parents and worked for me in our graffiti crew. I said, \u201CWhat\u2019d you do for Christmas?\u201D \u201COh, just right here.\u201D I said, \u201CAlone?\u201D And he said, \u201CNo, I invited six other guys from the graffiti crew who didn\u2019t had no place to go,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd they were all \u2026\u201D He named them, and they were enemies with each other. I said, \u201CWhat\u2019d you do?\u201D He goes, \u201CYou\u2019re not gonna believe it. I cooked a turkey.\u201D I said, \u201CWell, how\u2019d you prepare the turkey?\u201D He says, \u201CWell, you know, ghetto style.\u201D I said, \u201CNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m familiar with that recipe.\u201D He said, \u201CWell, you rub it with a gang of butter and you squeeze two limones on it and you put salt and pepper, put it in the oven. Tasted proper,\u201D he said. I said, \u201CWow. What else did you have besides turkey?\u201D \u201CWell, that\u2019s it, just turkey. Yeah, the seven of us, we just sat in the kitchen staring at the oven waiting for the turkey to be done. Did I mention it tasted proper?\u201D I said, \u201CYeah, you did.\u201D So what could be more sacred than seven orphans, enemies, rivals, sitting in a kitchen waiting for a turkey to be done? Jesus doesn\u2019t lose any sleep that we will forget that the Eucharist is sacred. He is anxious that we might forget that it\u2019s ordinary, that it\u2019s a meal shared among friends. And that\u2019s the incarnation, I think. In terms of just this idea of incarnation and relationship, I mean, it took me a long time into my reading about you and reading you to realize that one of the transformative things that happens in Homeboy Industries, which is a different model from your peacemaker days, is that people are simply working side by side. Kids who may have been in different gangs, they\u2019re sharing days and time and jobs. Is that right? My question also is, like, does it surprise you at this point of your life that some of the structure your vocation has taken is in starting these businesses? Yeah. You don\u2019t want to hear me talk about businesses. I\u2019m the least knowledgeable person on how to start. It\u2019s like don\u2019t try this at home. Yeah, but you\u2019re a CEO. You\u2019re an executive director, OK. I\u2019m a CEO. Oh, my gosh, I\u2019m a CEO. I\u2019m missing a board meeting to be here today, so I could not be one bit happier. Yeah. OK, but look, there\u2019s Homeboy Bakery, Homeboy Silk Screen, Homeboy Maintenance, Homeboy/Homegirl Merchandise, Homegirl Caf\u00E9. Those are businesses. You employ people. Yeah. And that came \u2014 that was born as \u2014 we began as sort of a job employment referral center, trying to find felony-friendly employers, and that wasn\u2019t so forthcoming. So by \u201992, we had to start our own \u2014 we really \u2014 so we couldn\u2019t wait. The demand was so huge, and gang members kept saying, \u201CIf only we had jobs.\u201D So we started Homeboy Bakery in 1992. And a month later, we started Homeboy Tortillas in the Grand Central Market, a historic kind of area in LA. Once we had two, once we had plural, we came up with the highfalutin Homeboy Industries, as if there was any industry involved in this venture. And then the idea is not just to have a paycheck, but I think one of the new things that I kind of discovered, probably in the last five years, is that community trumps gangs. So it\u2019s not enough to just say, \u201CHere\u2019s a job.\u201D Our motto, still on our T-shirts, is \u201CNothing Stops a Bullet Like a Job.\u201D But that does about 80 percent of what needs to be done. There\u2019s still the other 20 percent which is relational. And it\u2019s about healing. And it\u2019s about what psychologists would call \u201Cattachment repair\u201D because gang members come to us with this disorganized attachment. You know, mom was frightening or frightened. And you can\u2019t really soothe yourself if you\u2019ve never been calmed down by that significant person in your life. And it\u2019s never too late to kind of gain this. So they repair this attachment, and they learn some resilience, and then they redefine who they are in the world, which is really a huge task. And then we send them on beyond us. And then the world will throw at them what it will, but it won\u2019t topple them because they\u2019re this renewed person. That\u2019s sort of \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing this for 25 years. That\u2019s sort of the new piece in the last five years, that there\u2019s a task that happens and needs to be addressed and attended to. And that\u2019s the task. Were you attending to it before but not as intentionally? I mean, it was happening, but you\u2019ve named it now? That\u2019s right, yeah. But things like therapy \u2014 everybody\u2019s in therapy. And I have 300 employees and I have four paid therapists, but I have 41 volunteer therapists. So \u2014 but that\u2019s kind of a new openness to that that wasn\u2019t true in my first 10 years. Homies would always say, \u201CWell, I\u2019m not crazy.\u201D And there was a stigma. And then I noticed, I don\u2019t know how many years ago, maybe 15 years ago, homies would \u2014 I\u2019d say, \u201CYou know, it might help you to talk about all the stuff you\u2019ve been through in your life.\u201D And then a homie once said to me, \u201CYou mean, like Analyze This?\u201D He referenced that movie with Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro. And then I started hearing that. And you talk about a tipping point, where suddenly it was OK for people to be in therapy. So I don\u2019t sense any kind of stigma, which is really healthy and wonderful, because they have a lot of work to do. They\u2019ve been through a lot. You can listen again and share this conversation with Fr. Greg Boyle through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Fr. Greg Boyle at the Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution. We\u2019ve been talking about his understandings of life, of service, and of God, which have emerged through his ministry creating Homeboy Industries. It\u2019s one of the largest and most successful gang intervention programs in the U.S. I\u2019m going to ask one more question, then why don\u2019t we open this up for questions and comments. You, I\u2019ve read, were diagnosed with leukemia. Would that have been a decade ago now? I think it\u2019s probably \u2014 I think it\u2019s nine years. Nine years? And so you \u2014 in a less adrenaline-fueled way than a lot of the people you share a life with \u2014 have faced mortality. And I wonder, has that changed the way you move through life or even this work with them? Yeah. First of all, I wouldn\u2019t trade that period of my life for anything. It was about the most graced moment of my life. For as uncomfortable as chemotherapy is, and I\u2019m sure many in the audience have been through this, I wouldn\u2019t trade it because it was just so intimate and so mutual. But with the homies, it was this extraordinary place of exquisite mutuality that I really treasure. I was reading recently about the Dalai Lama. He was interviewed in The New Yorker, and somebody asked him about his own personal death. And he just shrugged, and he said, \u201CChange of clothing.\u201D And that was sort of my experience when I went through leukemia and greatly liberating. But because I\u2019ve had to bury so many kids, 183 kids \u2014 and kids I loved and kids I knew and killed by kids I loved. I mean, boy, if death is the worst thing that can happen to you, brace yourself because you will be toppled. And the trick is not to be toppled. The trick is to compile a list of all of the fates that are worse than death, but also compile the list of all the things so numerous to list, all the things that are more powerful than death. You know, that\u2019s what Jesus did. Jesus sort of put death in its place. Was it after your diagnosis that you discovered the story about the desert fathers and mothers, the one word they meditated on was\u2026 Oh, God. I read that a couple of days ago as I was getting ready for this and it\u2019s been so helpful for me. Yeah. Whenever the desert fathers and mothers would get absolutely despondent and didn\u2019t know how they were going to put one foot in front of the next, they had this mantra. And the mantra wasn\u2019t \u201CGod\u201D and the word wasn\u2019t \u201CJesus.\u201D But the word was \u201Ctoday.\u201D That\u2019s sort of the key. There\u2019s a play off-Broadway right now called \u201CNow. Here. This.\u201D It\u2019s \u201CNow,\u201D period, Here,\u201D H-E-R-E, period, \u201CThis.\u201D And that\u2019s kind of my \u2014 that\u2019s become my mantra. Lately, I\u2019m big on mantras. So when I\u2019m walking or before a kid comes into my office, I always say, \u201CNow. Here. This, Now. Here. This.\u201D So that I\u2019ll be present and right here to the person in front of me. So, I\u2019m thinking that you\u2019ve already told me the answer to this question, which is \u201CNow. Here. This.\u201D But I hear you, I am moved by your work, I am moved by the plight of the poor. And I am here for a week and then I go back to my privileged life in Fairfield County, Connecticut among my Unitarian Universalists co-congregants. What is the message? What is there to be done besides shrugging my shoulders and writing a check? Don\u2019t stop writing the checks, first of all. I owe that to my board meeting that\u2019s happening right now. OK. So I buy the indulgence and then what happens? Yeah. That\u2019s right. OK. The answer really is kinship. Everybody\u2019s so exhausted by kind of the tenor of the polarity right now in our country. And the division is the opposite of God, frankly. I always think of Dives with Lazarus. Dives is in hell not because he\u2019s rich but because he kind of refused to be in relationship with Lazarus, that that parable is not about bank accounts and heaven. It\u2019s really about us. And so what\u2019s on Jesus\u2019 mind, he says, that all may be one. And that\u2019s kind of where we need to inch our way closer, that we imagine a circle of compassion, then we imagine nobody\u2019s standing outside that circle. God created, if you will, an otherness so that we would dedicate our lives to a union with each other. Thank you. You know, I just want to say that question you posed so beautifully is a question that weighs on me. I think so many people are carrying that question around right now and feeling pretty hopeless about it. I mean, it\u2019s an open question and\u2026 Well, we\u2019re resisting the divide. We\u2019re resisting the divide, but we don\u2019t know how to do it. Right. We, privileged. Right. Not even the idea that we should create circles of inclusion. We live so separately that we don\u2019t know how to start those relationships. But I \u2014 one thing we\u2019re not trained to do is \u2014 I love Rilke\u2019s idea about holding the questions, living the questions until one day you live into an answer. So I think when we don\u2019t have the answer immediately before us, we then despair. I wonder if part of our work now is to hold that question and to pose it with each other and then, in that way, maybe we become listeners together and we start to\u2026 The Rilke piece is wonderful. Thank you. Oh, over here. Sorry. I grew up in the city and was homeschooled because my parents feared for my safety. And I go to St. Vivian Church, and they don\u2019t touch the city because of their fear. And how do you combat the fear with love and compassion? Thank you for your question. I read once that the Beatitudes was \u2014 the original language was not \u201CBlessed are\u201D or \u201CHappy are\u201D the single-hearted or those who work for peace or struggle for justice. The more precise translation is \u201CYou\u2019re in the right place if \u2026\u201D And I like that better because it turns out the Beatitudes is not a spirituality. It\u2019s a geography. It tells you where to stand. You\u2019re in the right place if you\u2019re over here. So, I come from Hollywood where we say, \u201CLocation, location, location.\u201D And it\u2019s about location. You really have to go out. But knowing that service is the hallway that leads to the ballroom, you don\u2019t want to have service be the end. It\u2019s the beginning. It\u2019s getting you to the ballroom, which is the place of kinship, the place of mutuality, that place that everybody knows here. When you go there, you go, \u201CWho is receiving from whom? Who\u2019s the service provider? Who\u2019s the service recipient?\u201D You hear yourself say that. \u201CI know I\u2019m here at the soup kitchen, but, my God, I\u2019m getting more from this.\u201D You know, everybody knows this. But it doesn\u2019t happen unless you break out. And fear is just fueled by ignorance. So you have to break out of our ignorance. We have to go to the place that frightens us, you know? And I\u2019m always admiring of employers, especially in the early days before we were kind of established, who would call us. And I\u2019d give a talk somewhere, and an employer would call me and say, \u201COK, send me somebody. I\u2019m scared, though.\u201D I said, \u201CI get it.\u201D Then they\u2019ll love who they get, some homie who\u2019s enormously eager and a good worker. And then he\u2019ll call and say, \u201CSend me somebody else like him too.\u201D But they had to take that \u2014 look before you leap, but leap. Thanks. I appreciate your personal stories, the interaction you have, but the young man on the steps and the like, but so many in the area where I come from, the way you deal with gangs is you incarcerate them. So how much of the interaction have you had with the justice system, the penal system, and how can we in communities that want to put these things and depersonalize them away \u2014 can we do, can be done, societally, congregationally, personally? I don\u2019t spend a lot of time in courts anymore except that I will always go as a \u2014 I will always testify when asked. And I\u2019m asked a lot in death penalty sentencing cases where there\u2019s a gang member. And I\u2019m called in as a gang expert because I oppose the death penalty. But I\u2019ve never encountered \u2014 and I\u2019ve probably done 50 of these across the country \u2014 I\u2019ve never encountered somebody, a gang member, who\u2019s on the stand, a defendant, who in my estimation was not mentally ill. The minute you start to hear the profile, and they always give you the profile, you go, wow, this is a deeply disturbed mentally ill person. No one wants you to say that. The prosecution refuses you to say anything like that. Even the defense says don\u2019t say anything like that. Why? Because then you\u2019re forced to \u2014 in the face of somebody who\u2019s mentally ill, you can only have one response and that\u2019s compassion. And this freaks us out because, oh, what happens to responsibility, and he knew what he was doing. Prosecutors always say to me, well, he could choose. I go, gosh, not all choices are created equal. And a person\u2019s ability to choose is not created equal. I don\u2019t know. If we were more sensible, at an early age, we\u2019d be somehow infusing the kids with hope when they can\u2019t imagine their future and they\u2019re planning their funerals. Or we\u2019d heal kids who are so damaged that they can\u2019t see their way clear to transform their pain so they continue to transmit it. Or to deliver mental health services in a timely, effective, appropriate way. If we did those things\u2026 If as a society, we did those things, we wouldn\u2019t be at the place we\u2019re at. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Fr. Greg Boyle, on his longtime, unusually successful work with former gang members in Los Angeles. I interviewed him in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution, and we also took questions from the audience. Hello. I probably have 50 questions, and it would be interesting to see which one\u2026 Do 49 of them and\u2026 Audience Member 4: \u2026which one comes out. I teach in a community college on the West Coast. And kind of similarly, I teach culinary arts. So I see a whole range of individuals and hear stories that would cripple most of us, what people are dealing with. But I think one of my key questions for you is, when I hear you use the word \u201Chomie,\u201D could you define what that means to you? As you give these talks around the country, I think about what are other people taking away from that word versus what it is that that word means to you. Yeah. Sometimes when I go to other parts of the country \u2014 I was on a radio show from Chicago where a caller came in who took quite exception to the word \u201Chomeboy.\u201D You don\u2019t find that so much in Los Angeles. And no thought went into this at all. With a movie producer, I\u2019m trying to get money out of him, and he says, \u201CWhat do you think I should do?\u201D And he had proposed a lot of ideas and I said, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t you buy this old abandoned bakery across the street? We\u2019ll call it Homeboy Bakery.\u201D That\u2019s how much thought went into this. So I wasn\u2019t kind of measuring and calculating, \u201CWill this have \u2014\u201D But in the end, I\u2019m OK with it because it\u2019s sort of like walking in the door and coming out another door. You\u2019ll hear homeboys say, \u201CHey, do you know Mr. Sanchez? You know, he\u2019s my math teacher.\u201D I said, \u201CNo, I don\u2019t.\u201D \u201COh, that\u2019s the homie right there.\u201D It\u2019s a way of connecting. In the end, it\u2019s a word that is soaked with kinship. And if Mother Teresa says the problem in the world is that we\u2019ve just forgotten that we belong to each other, there\u2019s the potential, anyway, I think, for the word \u201Chomeboy\u201D and \u201Chomegirl\u201D to kind of say we\u2019re connected. It\u2019s a way of saying we belong to each other. And it doesn\u2019t have to do with, \u201CHe\u2019s in my gang, and he isn\u2019t.\u201D And that\u2019s why the homeboy community, and homegirls as well, are folks who experience this connection and sense of belonging with each other. I\u2019m particularly impressed with your using the words \u201Cwalking in the lowly places.\u201D That\u2019s where Jesus would stand. But the question I have is, you also talk about the prophetic and the hilarious, and I recall that, if you look at the Dalai Lama, Thomas Merton, many of them have this wonderful sense of joy, and you seem to have this sense of humor. I often find that peacemakers, peacekeepers, are so intense and the weight is so heavy that there\u2019s very little time for laughter. I would like to know how it comes that you have this wonderful spirit of joy or what I\u2019d call healthy humor. And could you explain a little bit how you got that? It\u2019s like \u2014 I don\u2019t know who talked about it \u2014 like discussing humor is like dissecting a frog. You can do it, but the frog dies in the process. So I don\u2019t know. I mean, again, it\u2019s about joy. My joy may be in you, and your joy may be complete. You want to have a light grasp on life. And then in the end, it\u2019s precisely those kinds of moments that teach you something. I mean, real quickly, one of my favorites recently was Diane Keaton showed up for lunch at a Homegirl Caf\u00E9, the Oscar-winning actress, Annie Hall and Godfather movies. She\u2019s there with a regular guy who\u2019s there once a week. And her waitress is Glenda. And Glenda is a homegirl, been there, done that tattooed, felon, parolee. She doesn\u2019t know who Diane Keaton is. And so she\u2019s taking her order, and Diane Keaton says, \u201CWell, what do you recommend?\u201D And Glenda rattles off the three platillos that she really likes, and Diane Keaton says, \u201COh, I\u2019ll have that second one. That one sounds good.\u201D And then it was suddenly at that moment that something dawns on Glenda and she looked at Diane Keaton. She goes, \u201CWait a minute. I feel like I know you, like maybe we\u2019ve met somewhere.\u201D And Diane Keaton decides to sort of deflect it humbly and say, \u201COh, gosh, I don\u2019t know. I suppose I have one of those faces, you know, that people think they\u2019ve seen before.\u201D And then Glenda goes, \u201CNo. Now I know. We were locked up together.\u201D And aside from the fact that that story absolutely took my breath away when I heard it \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had any further Diane Keaton sightings, now that I think of it \u2014 that in the end, it\u2019s about something. It\u2019s about kinship. It\u2019s about Oscar-winning actress, attitude in a waitress, that you may be one. That\u2019s the whole thing, that God has created this otherness so that you might bump into each other and find that you\u2019re homies, that you were locked up together. I just want to say, as we close, you said at the beginning \u2014 and I pushed back and said how hard that is \u2014 that the job is to be who God is in the world. As you tell these stories of this life you lead \u2014 you told the story in your book about \u2014 and you touched on this a moment ago. You first arrived in the neighborhood, and you expected people to come to you, and you would walk around. And that didn\u2019t work. It was when you started visiting people when they were in hospital or visiting people when they were in prison that they then acknowledged you as a member of the community. And that\u2019s so resonant with that beautiful passage in Matthew, Matthew 25, about God saying you visited me when I was sick, you clothed me, you fed me. And they said, when was that? When you fed, clothed, visited the least of these. So I think it\u2019s wonderful how you show that that is doable, incarnating this incarnational message at the heart of Christianity. And you probably are too humble to want to take that in. Well, thank you for that. But I also feel like, in the end, it is about imitating \u2014 trying to imitate the kind of God you believe in. And it\u2019s natural for us to push back on that. But the truth is, we\u2019re so used to a God, a one-false-move God. And so we\u2019re not really accustomed to the no-matter-whatness of God, to the God who\u2019s just plain old too busy loving us to be disappointed in us. And that is, I think, the hardest thing to believe, but everybody in this space knows it\u2019s the truest thing you can say about God. I wondered if, in closing, you would read this little poem by the 14th-century Persian poet Hafiz, and why you put that in your book. And the fact that it\u2019s from the 14th century I love because it reminds us that we\u2019ve always been this way as human beings. Yeah, I don\u2019t know why I put it in my book. So now I\u2019m living my nightmare of my interview with Krista Tippett. Now proven myself shallow and uninteresting. Anyway, it\u2019s called \u201CWith That Moon Language.\u201D \u201CAdmit something: Everyone you see, you say to them, \u2018Love me.\u2019 Of course you do not do this out loud, otherwise someone would call the cops. Still, though, think about this, this great pull in us to connect. Why not become the one who lives with a full moon in each eye that is always saying, with that sweet moon language, what every other eye in this world is dying to hear?\u201D Thank you, Greg Boyle.
