  "fullText": "What we do not know about a missing loved one, the poet T.S. Eliot said, becomes all that we know. The airplane that disappears, the kidnapped child, the natural disaster that sweeps lives off a map \u2014 this is dramatic territory human beings are not equipped to master. But loved ones go missing in other ways, incrementally, across the ordinary course of each of our lives \u2014 through mental illness, aging, divorce, dementia. We experience senseless, sudden collective loss after mass shootings. Pauline Boss is called in for counsel by organizations like the Red Cross, by families and corporations, and after events like 9/11 \u2014 where there is grieving with no possibility of closure. But she says closure is a myth that leads us astray. We can soften the stress of our own grief and that of others by opening to the ambiguity of reality. There is no such thing as closure. We have to live with loss, clear or ambiguous. And it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK. And it\u2019s OK to see people who are hurting and just to say something simple. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry.\u201D You really don\u2019t have to say more than that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Pauline Boss is an Emeritus Professor at the University of Minnesota. Her 1999 book Ambiguous Loss coined a phrase that has become a field in psychology and family therapy. She was one of the first to name the reality that the so-called \u201Cnormal\u201D family of the American post-war era often had an absent father at its heart \u2014 alive, but not present in meaningful ways, there but not there. She grew up in a first generation Swiss-American immigrant family in Wisconsin. Here\u2019s a line I found in your writing that I feel \u2014 to me \u2014 I would say this is also a description of spiritual background and also, I think, a bridge to the work you\u2019ve ended up doing. And you said, \u201CHomesickness was an essential part of my family\u2019s culture.\u201D It was. I think it may be true for all immigrant families, but it certainly was for mine. And it was even in the village because there were many immigrant families there. Mm-hmm. And so it became a sort of pathos that would be in the family when we weren\u2019t even aware of it, except that I could see the sadness periodically, like when my father would get a letter from Switzerland, or worse yet, a letter with a black rim around it, which meant announcement of death in the family. So, I was always aware that there was another family somewhere, and that there was some homesickness, except where was home? And I figured that home was in Wisconsin where we lived, but yet I knew he had this other family across the Atlantic that he pined for. And my maternal grandmother was the same. And, of course, she refused to learn English. She said she lost her mountains, she lost her mother, she lost her friends, and she wasn\u2019t going to lose her language. Mm. So I think that, too, is not unusual for immigrant families today, especially the elders. One thing reading that about your family made me reflect on is that we talk a lot about immigrants, right? And especially now. Yes. And we even talk about things like people sending money back to family. Yes. But we don\u2019t kind of acknowledge the grief or that homesickness or that sadness, that loss that must always be there, even when people have made a choice to go far away. I think that\u2019s part of our American culture that we don\u2019t want to hear that. We don\u2019t just deny death in our culture, I think we deny ambiguous loss that comes with things like immigration. And homesickness comes along with that and we really want people to get over it. Yeah, that\u2019s right. And they don\u2019t. And in fact, it\u2019s paradoxical. The more you want people to get over it, the longer it will take for them. And why not remember your former country, your former island, your former culture while you\u2019re learning to fit into the new one? In other words, having two cultures is what it ends up being. Mm-hmm. And you have one foot in the old and one foot in the new. And one can live that way. That may be the most honest way to do it. Mm. What\u2019s interesting to me is the way you started thinking about ambiguous loss. You started with this idea of father absence. And you would eventually call this kind of \u201Ctype-two ambiguous loss,\u201D which is somebody\u2019s here, but they\u2019re not here. I mean, we\u2019ll talk some more about these different forms of ambiguous loss, and I think especially this one. The type-one ambiguous loss that eventually became the other kind of foundation of the field is \u2014 I also very much like the stuff of news headlines and \u2014 so if there\u2019s this type of ambiguous loss, which is physical presence and psychological absence, which would also be dementia\u2026 Right. Autism\u2026 \u2026or kind of mental illness where people incrementally disappear. But there\u2019s also physical absence and psychological presence, though the person disappears. Yes. For me to think about you coining this term in the 1970s and thinking about the MIAs of the Vietnam War \u2014 like missing in action. I remember growing up in those years. We all wore these bracelets, right? Yes. Or you had the name of someone. And I think, as a child, being aware of how completely traumatizing that was but probably not understanding that trauma \u2014 it\u2019s in these kinds of great disasters that you\u2019ve been called in, where you\u2019ve been called in to help people with the Red Cross like that tsunami where people get swept away. Mm-hmm. I didn\u2019t intend that. Yeah. You mean when you started out? Not at all. Yeah. I\u2019m really not a \u2014 I\u2019m not a first responder. I\u2019m not even brave. And I\u2019m not good in the field. But when I was studying this psychological absence, and I gave my first paper on that as a graduate student, the military was in the audience. And they said, if you would reverse this and study physical absence, we would have data for you on the families of the missing in action soldiers in Vietnam. Oh, so they had experienced that trauma of people not being able to say goodbye, not being able to bury their dead. Yes. And it was the military from The Center for Prisoner of War Studies in San Diego who recognized that \u2014 they said I had a theory, and they had data, and could we get together? So I hadn\u2019t written \u2014 I was going to write my dissertation on psychological father absence, so that got dropped. Mm-hmm. And so instead I wrote it on physical father absence, because at that time, the MIAs were all male. And that took me down this road of more disastrous kinds of losses outside the home, and the rest is history. Yeah. And I feel like \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve been aware of your work and kind of in this on and off conversation with you \u2014 I feel like these kinds of events are just that much more in our cultural imagination. They are. I mean, the Malaysian airplane that disappears without a trace, and \u2014 maybe it\u2019s also because the cameras are ever-present, and we see that these people, these family members, cannot find peace. And I think it\u2019s personal too. You\u2019re absolutely right that you can\u2019t pick up the newspaper without \u2014 I think almost each day \u2014 finding some kind of missing person or disappearance or someone regarding some kind of physical loss each day. But I think it also hits our psyche deeply. Yeah. We come from culture in this country of, I think, mastery orientation. We like to solve problems. We\u2019re not comfortable with unanswered questions. And this is full of unanswered questions. These are losses that are minus facts. Somebody\u2019s gone, you don\u2019t know where they are, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re alive or dead, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re coming back. And so, that kind of mystery, I think, gives us a feeling of helplessness that we\u2019re very uncomfortable with as a society. So, I think it \u2014 we\u2019re taken to this idea that we see in the paper all the time. It\u2019s not always called \u201Cambiguous loss,\u201D but I think those ideas pull people in because of the helplessness of it. And so we say, \u201Cthank God it\u2019s not me.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with \u201Cambiguous loss\u201D expert and family therapist Pauline Boss. One thing that you say is that the kind of grief that\u2019s involved in ambiguous loss is distinct from traditional grief. So how is it different? Yes. Well, with ambiguous loss, there\u2019s really no possibility of closure. Mm-hmm. Not even, in fact, resolution, whichever word you prefer to use. And therefore, it ends up looking like what the psychiatrists now call \u201Ccomplicated grief.\u201D Right. And that is, in fact, a diagnosis, complicated grief. And it\u2019s believed that it requires some kind of psychiatric intervention. My point is very different, that ambiguous loss is a complicated loss, which causes, therefore, complicated grief, but it is not pathological. Individually, that is. It\u2019s not a pathological psyche; it\u2019s a pathological situation. And as clients frequently say back to me, \u201COh, you mean the situation is crazy, not me,\u201D that\u2019s what exactly what I mean. It\u2019s an illogical, chaotic, unbelievably painful situation that these people go through who have missing loved ones, either physically or psychologically. And if they have some symptoms of grief that carry on, let\u2019s say even for five or ten years, if it\u2019s a caregiver of an Alzheimer\u2019s patient or the parent of a missing child, there is nothing wrong with them. That is typical. That is to be expected, that they would grieve along the way for the various things that they are missing. For example, if a child is kidnapped, they may have an extra grief when this child\u2019s friends are graduating. Yeah. Or when this child\u2019s friends are marrying or having their first job or going away for college. So the grief is long-term. It is chronic grief. Yes. So, I worked as a \u2014 when I was in divinity school \u2014 as a chaplain on an Alzheimer\u2019s ward. And I remember watching people come to see their loved one, their spouse, their grandmother, their sister. And I remember, as this person who just wandered in and was there to care about people and care for them, I would be so impatient with how people would be so upset when they came in and this person didn\u2019t remember their name. And over time, I got so much more compassionate about that because I realized that the stress, the difficulty \u2014 because it was like an incremental death. Right? That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s an incremental death. So every time they came, there was a little bit more gone. And yet, it\u2019s this person who looks the same. And it is this monumental struggle for people to peacefully inhabit this reality that this person they love is \u2014 as you say \u2014 there and not there. Both here and gone. Yeah. But then the other thing that I think we observe culturally \u2014 and I guess this is the corollary to it \u2014 is \u2014 I feel like it\u2019s kind of mysterious how important it is for human beings to bury their dead. Yes, it is. Right? But how do you understand what that is in us? Like, as a species, that we \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s so important to bury our dead, but I think it\u2019s important for us to know where the body is. Right. To have a body. And then we get some mastery by having which rituals we want, and burying them where we want or how we want, whether it\u2019s scattering of ashes or a burial in the ground. I think that\u2019s very important. We need some control when we lose someone like that. But I think it\u2019s also \u2014 has to do with attachment. People want to come back to touch base with where this body is, or where the symbol of this body is. People of the missing, of course, come back to the memorials, like the 9/11 Memorial, or the ones in Japan after tsunami, or wherever around the world, Holocaust memorials. That those touch those places, that need in us. Yes. They\u2019re helpful in place of a burial site. So people who don\u2019t know where their loved ones are really, really need memorials. They play a very great function in our psychological well-being. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s from you that I\u2019ve learned that \u2014 to the extent that we have a cultural vocabulary of grief, it was very much formed by Elizabeth K\u00FCbler-Ross and her delineating the five stages of grief in 1969 \u2014 denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. It\u2019s from you I\u2019ve learned that, in fact, she never meant for those stages of grief to be understood \u2014 to be taken on the way we\u2019ve taken them on, which is that when we encounter any grieving person or any person\u2019s loss, even the more traditional forms of loss, we think that\u2019s kind of a prescription for what they go through, and then they get to the end. That\u2019s part, again, of a culture of mastery, a culture of problem-solving and wanting to move on with things. Elizabeth K\u00FCbler-Ross found those five stages to be relevant to people who are dying, who are fading into death. Right. Not someone who\u2019s at the loss end of that death. No. She did not mean that for the family members, but, in fact, it blurred over into that. And I don\u2019t know if that was her, or I think it was more so her followers. Today, the new research in grief and loss does not recommend linear stages. We like linear stages, though \u2014 and the news media really likes it \u2014 because, in fact, it has an ending. It has a finite end. Right. If you start with stage one, and you move on through stage five\u2026 You\u2019ll finally get to acceptance. \u2026you\u2019re done. You\u2019re no longer grieving. Well, we now know that this is not true and that human beings live with grief and, in fact, are able to live with grief. They don\u2019t have to get over it. They don\u2019t obsess with it five years down the road, but they occasionally remember and are sad, or go to the grave, or have some thoughts about the person who died. And this is normal. So, we now know that living with grief is more oscillations of up and down. And those ups and downs get farther apart over time, but they never completely go away, the downs of feeling blue, of feeling sad. Mm-hmm. And in order to understand this, though, we have to make a difference between depression and sadness. Right, right. To say that sadness is not depression. And so far, that hasn\u2019t been made. Right. Yes. Depression is an illness that requires a medical intervention. It\u2019s the minority of people who have depression. And yet, with the ambiguous loss of let\u2019s say Alzheimer\u2019s disease and 50-some other dementias, caregivers are said to be depressed. Most of the caregivers I have met and studied and treated are not depressed; they\u2019re sad. They\u2019re grieving. And this should be normalized. And sadness is treated with human connection. Mm. So, one of the things that you say \u2014 and this makes so much sense, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that makes sense \u2014 we have to say it \u2014 that people can\u2019t cope with the problem until they know what the problem is. Yes. You\u2019ve said with ambiguous loss that once people have a name for it, just that\u2026 That helps. \u2026that the stress level goes down a bit. Yes. I learned that by doing it the first time \u2014 and that is when you say to people \u2014 for example, after 9/11, we were working with the families of the workers who cleaned the Trade Towers and ran the elevators and ran the air conditioning and the windows on the World Restaurant. Many of them did not speak English, so we had to translate. And my beginning was this \u2014 \u201CWhat you\u2019re experiencing is ambiguous loss because your loved ones are still missing. It is the most difficult, most stressful loss there is, but it is not your fault.\u201D That\u2019s all I would say before the translators took over, and the people understood that and felt relieved. After a traumatic event, most people blame themselves, even if it\u2019s a tornado, by the way. I\u2019ve seen this. You mean they find ways to think that they were responsible for what happened? Yes, exactly. There was one woman after 9/11 who had a newborn, and she was blaming herself because she didn\u2019t wake her husband up early enough that morning. He had an alarm clock, and it didn\u2019t go off. He was in the Trade Tower usually by 8:00 and out by 9:00. And on this day, he was late, and so he was in the Trade Tower when it went down. Right. She blamed herself as she was crying. She was at her wit\u2019s end. And about a year later \u2014 we would meet, by the way, every month or so. About a year later, I complimented her on how lovely her little boy was. He was standing up at that time, leaning on her leg. And she said to me, \u201CDo you remember that story I told you about my husband oversleeping? And that it was my fault?\u201D I said, \u201CYes, I remember.\u201D And she said, \u201CWell, he always set the alarm clock. And I realized that, finally. And it wasn\u2019t my fault. He just wanted another hour to be with us.\u201D Mm. Now that\u2019s the transformation we\u2019re after with ambiguous loss, where she is no longer blaming herself and she has a meaning that she can live with the rest of her life without too much stress. You\u2019ve said that dialectical thinking, that paradoxical thinking, helps. And I think that\u2019s an example of that. But explain that, what you mean by that. Because \u2014 and again, I think that\u2019s not necessarily instinctive for us as creatures, and certainly not in moments when we\u2019re stressed. Yes. I think it might be a more Eastern way of thinking, actually. Yeah. But yes, the only way to live with ambiguous loss is to hold two opposing ideas in your mind at the same time. And these are some examples. With the physically missing, people might say, \u201CHe\u2019s gone, he\u2019s probably dead, and maybe not,\u201D or \u201CHe may be coming back, but maybe not.\u201D Those kinds of thinking are common, and it is the only way that people can lower the stress of living with the ambiguity. And children learn it rapidly, and even adults learn it. It doesn\u2019t take too long. It is not part of our culture, however. We like finite answers. You\u2019re either dead or you\u2019re alive. You\u2019re either here or you\u2019re gone. And let\u2019s say you have somebody with dementia, or a child with autism, and they\u2019re there, but they\u2019re not always there. And so once you put that frame on it, people are more at ease and recognize that that may be the closest to the truth that they\u2019re going to get. To say either or, to think in a more binary way \u2014 he\u2019s dead or he\u2019s alive, you\u2019re either here or you\u2019re gone \u2014 that would involve some denial and lack of truth, so the only truth is that middle way of \u201Che may be coming back and maybe not.\u201D I see so that the inclination that we have is \u2014 even culturally is Americans are such fighters, right? Yes, we are. So they\u2019ll say, \u201CWell, we will solve this mystery. I will find them. We will find a cure.\u201D Right? Or, on the other hand, as friends or colleagues, we kind of want people to get over it, right? Yes. Or even as people we love. We love this person, and we want them to get over it because it feels like they\u2019re kind of choosing pain, I suppose. And we don\u2019t like suffering. Yeah, right. It\u2019s a more Eastern idea that suffering is part of life. Our idea is that suffering is something you should get over \u2014 and as you say \u2014 cure it, or fix it, or find some solution for it. The fact of the matter is \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing, by the way. It is probably what has made our society great, and has made technology so wonderful, and cures for diseases, and so on. So, I don\u2019t want to put that down at all. But here\u2019s the crux \u2014 now and then, there\u2019s a problem that has no solution. It could be an illness. It could be a lost person. It could be something like more everyday ambiguous losses such as adoption, divorce, immigration. Now and then, there are problems that don\u2019t have a perfect fix. And then this idea of holding two opposing ideas in your mind at the same time is very useful for stress reduction. Yes. Mm. I was listening to you \u2014 I think one of the questions that is on many people\u2019s minds when you have this conversation is, \u201CWhat do you know about what\u2019s the best way to react?\u201D And I was listening to you on a call-in show. And people would call in, and everybody had such a unique story. And I remember a woman whose brother, I think, went hiking and just never came back. It was a wilderness area, and they never found his body. And it was a decade ago. And I just \u2014 I listened to you listening to her, and the question you asked was, \u201CAnd how long has it been?\u201D And it was 10 years, 14 years. I think that might be a question that, in kind of normal interactions, one might be embarrassed to ask, or feel like that would take them back, or something. So you asked that, and she answered it. And then you just said, \u201CI am so sorry.\u201D Mm-hmm. I remember that. Yeah. There\u2019s really nothing else to say. And I think we could help each other in society to learn how to speak to people who have missing loved ones. I think it\u2019s perfectly good to ask them, \u201CHow long has it been?\u201D Because they want to tell you how long it\u2019s been, and sometimes it\u2019s been decades. And, for example, with the Holocaust, and slavery \u2014 shall we go back \u2014 and Civil War, and with the Native Americans, and any genocide throughout the world \u2014 it can be a hundred years, and they still remember it. And so it\u2019s OK to say, \u201CHow long has it been?\u201D And then to say probably the only honest thing you can say, if you feel it, and that is, \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D Mm-hmm. We can\u2019t fix it, you see. Right. We can\u2019t fix it. You can listen again and share this conversation with Pauline Boss through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring complicated grief, the myth of closure, and learning to hold the losses in our midst, with Pauline Boss. She created the field of \u201Cambiguous loss.\u201D It\u2019s so interesting how there\u2019s this whole new field now of epigenetics, of how trauma transmits itself generationally and the way future generations \u2014 not so much as an exact memory, but as a response that is conditioned by the trauma that actually happened to previous generations. And then recently, as I\u2019ve been writing, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about growing up with a father who was adopted, who had this loss of memory. But thinking about how that affected me and the family indirectly. So I\u2019m just curious about how you see that kind of loss that happened to previous generations, like, how you see that turn up, and how you work with that. I think there is a generational transmission of trauma regarding ambiguous loss. Drew Gilpin Faust wrote the book The Republic of Suffering. And she was the president of Harvard? Harvard. She was the president of Harvard. But she\u2019s a psychologist, originally? No, she\u2019s a historian. Historian. OK, right. And she makes the point that our republic, our country, was founded on unresolved loss because of the Civil War and all the tragedy that happened there, and that many of these bodies never came home, and so on. So it was not really resolved in the usual way, and as a result, our republic is founded on suffering. And I think she pretty much leaves it there, but I would carry it further by saying it wasn\u2019t just the Civil War. It was slavery. It was the uprooting of the American Indians. It was all the immigrants that have come since then. And every genocide that has happened worldwide creates a society of suffering that is ancestral suffering that passes down through family patterns and family processes. Sometimes we don\u2019t even know. After the Holocaust, for example, the first generation didn\u2019t speak of it. Right. Many times, the traumatized first generation doesn\u2019t speak of it. The soldiers are that way too. Then the second generation wonders why and are angry at their parents. And it may be the third generation, the grandchildren, who finally get the answer. But at any rate\u2026 Of what happened. Of what happened, and why grandpa is the way he is, or why grandma is the way she is. And so the story finally comes out, perhaps because the grandparent is now approaching old age and thinks they better share the story while they still can. Right. Even when the stories aren\u2019t told, however, there\u2019s a transmission of the trauma by, let\u2019s say, having a parent who is not expressive, a parent who doesn\u2019t speak much, a parent who can\u2019t show love or emotion, or a parent who may have been brutalized who then passes on the violence. So there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happens when this is transmitted. And what we do need to know is that our society as a whole \u2014 not just families, but our society as a whole \u2014 I think, is afraid of talking about death, and is afraid of talking about suffering, and having people gone lost and grieving for a long time primarily because of this transmission of trauma ancestrally. That we are a nation founded on unresolved grief \u2014 as a result, we don\u2019t like to talk about death and we don\u2019t, for sure, like to talk about ambiguous loss. And one person you refer to often who is Viktor Frankl. I do. He wrote Man\u2019s Search for Meaning. Mm-hmm. Which many people have read. And of course, he was writing out of this example of horrific violence and loss and ambiguity. And yet, insisting on acknowledging the horror of that, right? He did, he did. Letting that be true forever and also insisting that meaning can be found. Yes. And he was the one who said, \u201CWithout meaning there is no hope, but without hope there is no meaning.\u201D So he tied those together. What we know now is that the search for meaning is critical in situations of loss, clear or ambiguous, and in situations of trauma. This is very difficult. For example, if a child dies, or if a child commits suicide, or is murdered, or if a loved one disappears at sea \u2014 it\u2019s nonsensical. But my point is that, too, is a meaning. The fact that it\u2019s meaningless is a meaning, and it always will be meaningless. Say some more. What do you mean? If something is nonsensical, totally without logic, without meaning, as many of these terrible events are, then I think we have to leave it there. But I think we have to label it as it\u2019s meaningless. Mm-hmm. And I can live with something meaningless, someone might say, but what I\u2019ve found is as long as I have something else in my life that is meaningful. So the search for meaning remains \u2014 that stays vital, but you don\u2019t necessarily locate the meaning in that terrible thing. You have to find the meaning elsewhere in your life. You may find it elsewhere. And many people\u2026 And let that be good enough. Exactly. I like that term, \u201Cgood enough,\u201D Krista. That\u2019s \u2014 in fact, I wrote a chapter on \u201Cgood enough.\u201D We really have to give up on perfection, of a perfect answer. There are a lot of situations that have no perfect answer. And so, let\u2019s say the mother of a kidnapped child may then in fact devote her life to helping prevent other children from going missing. And you see that all the time. Right. Where people who have terrible things happen to them then transform it into something that may help others. That\u2019s a way of finding meaning in meaninglessness. Mm-hmm. I mean, you\u2019ve even started talking \u2014 I think the writing you\u2019re doing now and I feel like what is absorbing you now is really \u2014 the phrase you\u2019re using is \u201Cthe myth of closure.\u201D Yes. That in fact, I don\u2019t know when that word got inserted into our vocabulary. Maybe you can speak to that, but that that word has lead us astray. I believe that. I think \u201Cclosure,\u201D though, is a perfectly good word for real estate and business deals. So, I don\u2019t want to demonize the word \u201Cclosure.\u201D Right. Yeah. But \u201Cclosure\u201D is a terrible word in human relationships. Once you\u2019ve become attached to somebody, love them, care about them, when they\u2019re lost, you still care about them. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s a different dimension. But you can\u2019t just turn it off. And we look around down the street from me \u2014 there\u2019s a Thai restaurant where there\u2019s a plate of fresh food in the window every day for their ancestors. Are they pathological? No. That\u2019s a cultural way to remember your ancestors. And somehow in our society, we\u2019ve decided, once someone is dead, you have to close the door. But we now know that people live with grief. They don\u2019t have to get over it. It\u2019s perfectly fine. I\u2019m not talking about obsession, but just remembering. I want to read something you wrote in The Guardian. I think the occasion of this may have been the tsunami maybe, or the Japanese earthquake, but\u2026 The Malaysian airliner, I think. Yeah, the Malaysian airline. But you were writing about some of what you had learned in 9/11. You wrote, \u201COne year later, a New York reporter doing a story on the anniversary of 9/11 asked me why I thought New Yorkers weren\u2019t over it yet. My answer, \u2018Because you are trying to get over it.\u2019\u201D Yes. \u201CParadoxically, as T.S. Eliot suggests, what we do not know about a missing loved one becomes all that we know. Another poet, John Keats, recommends in his letters to a young poet that he develop \u2018a capability for living with unanswered questions.\u2019 Keats calls this \u2018negative capability,\u2019 and this is what it takes to live with loved ones gone missing. This is also the way for the rest of us to stop pressuring these families to find closure.\u201D Yes. Yeah. Yes. We just have to stop pressuring people to get over it. It\u2019s cruel, actually, to do that. I was critical of the news media about their yearning for closure. They like the word \u201Cclosure.\u201D But I have to say that once, listening to CNN, Anderson Cooper stopped the other reporters and said, \u201CThat\u2019s a bad word. There is no such thing as closure.\u201D And I just loved him for that. And I know from his own biography that he knows what loss is, and he understands that there is no closure. So he\u2019s the only reporter I\u2019ve ever heard explain that in the line of his work. And I think the rest of us have to do a better job of it too. Mm-hmm. There is no such thing as closure. We have to live with loss, clear or ambiguous. And it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK. And it\u2019s OK to see people who are hurting and just to say something simple. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry.\u201D You really don\u2019t have to say more than that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with \u201Cambiguous loss\u201D expert and family therapist Pauline Boss. There\u2019s some place \u2014 I want to look for this in my notes. Let me just find \u2014 oh, here it is. \u201CWhen loss remains ambiguous, the only window for change lies in perceptions, and human perceptions are real and there are consequences.\u201D Yes. And the perception \u2014 when you have an ambiguous loss, perhaps any stress or event, how the person or the family as a whole perceives it varies a great deal, even in one neighborhood, but definitely across the globe, across cultures. And so in order for us to know how to help those families, we first have to figure out how they perceive it. Again, we\u2019re back to meaning, really. What is the meaning this has to you? And so, in fact, that is the first question I ask. \u201CWhat does this mean to you?\u201D Because until I know what this means to them, I have no idea about how to intervene. If I say, \u201CWhat does this mean to you,\u201D they may say, \u201CIt\u2019s a punishment from God,\u201D or, \u201CIt\u2019s a punishment from my loved one. He\u2019s always been after me,\u201D or something like that. Then I know what their viewpoint is and can proceed that way. Or they may say, \u201CI always fail at everything. That\u2019s what this means.\u201D Then you know you proceed that way. Or a person might say, \u201CThis is another challenge, and I think I can manage it.\u201D This is another meaning. It was like the alarm clock story I told. Right, right, right. So, perception matters very much. And it opens the window for how you would proceed toward resilience and strength. You also \u2014 I haven\u2019t found you writing about this exhaustively, but you mention it \u2014 that you went through a divorce, you were divorced from the father of your children. And that divorce is an ambiguous loss and that really brings this down to earth because so many of us \u2014 that is an experience that is so common. Yes. And I have to say I get it, but I also kind of want you to explain to me how it\u2019s an ambiguous loss. Well, obviously, it\u2019s not as dramatic as the disasters we are talking about, but it\u2019s more common every day. And that is you are leaving someone, you have lost someone by the divorce certificate, but they\u2019re still here. So they\u2019re here, but not here. And they\u2019re present and also absent at the same time. That\u2019s especially true when you co-parent children. And so divorce is a kind of human relationship that is ruptured but not gone. When I was studying at the University of Wisconsin, this psychiatrist I was studying with, Carl Whittaker, said to us, \u201CThere\u2019s no such thing as divorce. You can never get divorced.\u201D And at that time, we were just furious with him for saying that. Right. But in fact, that\u2019s correct. Once you have had an attachment, you cannot cut it off entirely. It is part of your being. It is part of who you are. And as I say, if you\u2019re co-parenting children, you are physically interacting still. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s in and out. And that\u2019s the ambiguity of divorce. It\u2019s the way it is. Mm-hmm. And it is a grief. It\u2019s a loss, right? Even if you want it, and it\u2019s the right thing and all that\u2026 There\u2019s still the grief. And what struck me as I was thinking about this, thinking about interviewing you is this is maybe another one of these areas where we could be kinder, where we could be better. Because I think when we talk about divorce or when find out somebody\u2019s getting a divorce, I\u2019m not sure that we treat it as we would a loss or that we acknowledge that grief in the room. And sometimes I\u2019ve made a mistake by saying I\u2019m sorry, and they\u2019ll say, \u201CDon\u2019t be.\u201D Right. That\u2019s right. Yeah. So, here\u2019s where I prefer to use the line, \u201CWhat does that mean to you?\u201D So they can give you a clue as to where they are with the divorce. Some people these days will just say, \u201CWell, we\u2019re just both fine. And we just decided to go our separate ways.\u201D And then somebody else may say, \u201CI\u2019m devastated.\u201D So I think that question of, \u201CWhat does this mean to you?\u201D is a way to get a clue. And then to know what to \u2014 how to proceed after that. Mm-hmm. This kind of follows on something you said a little while ago about \u2014 that there is no such thing as closure. That when you have a loss or you have grief, it remains part of you in some way, and that that\u2019s normal. And here\u2019s another way you said it \u2014 \u201CThat keeping deceased loved ones in your heart and mind, like a sword of psychological family, can be rich in meaning, and it should not be branded as pathology.\u201D And you wrote this essay about the myth of closure, the problem with closure, with a colleague. Was she also a psychiatrist? Psychologist? No, no. Donna\u2026 Donna Carnes. She\u2019s a poet. Oh, OK. Living in Madison, Wisconsin. All right. So that makes sense. Because her poetry, she \u2014 tell her story. She had lost \u2014 she had a very kind of classic case of ambiguous loss. Yes. Jim Gray was a computer scientist \u2014 first computer scientist, Turing Award winner, famous mentor of a lot of the people on the West Coast in the tech arena. He went sailing one Sunday, and \u2014 out of San Francisco Bay, and has not been seen since. I worked with the family and, in fact, with Microsoft to have a tribute instead of a memorial. Jim Gray\u2019s wife is named Donna Carnes. And she is now back in Wisconsin, which was her family origin home. And she has written some wonderful poems, I think, about her missing husband. And that is how she copes. And I wondered if you would read this one, which I think was the last one in that article. I have it here, \u201CWalk On.\u201D Which just seemed to me \u2014 this felt like such a \u2014 like it captured a way to do this thing you talk about \u2014 of live with ambiguity, and let the grief be part of you, and let the loss be a loss, and let life have meaning. So, anyway. Donna Carnes wrote \u201CWalk On.\u201D \u201CYou walk on still beside me, eyes shadowed in dusk. You\u2019re the lingering question at each day\u2019s end. I have to laugh at how open-ended you remain, still with me after all these years of being lost. I carry you like my own personal time machine, as I put on my lipstick, smile, and head out to the party.\u201D Yeah. You know, Pauline, you do \u2014 even in the beginning, I think, of the Ambiguous Loss book, which was your first book, you talk about the kinship between the poet and the therapist. I do. Would you say a little bit about that? Yeah, that was so intriguing to me. Yes. I think \u2014 where was that now? The \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I think I have to read it because\u2026 Maybe it was in this, The Myth Of Closure. I think it is here. And I do believe this. \u201CScientific discoveries happen not through method or magic, but from being open to discovery by listening to one\u2019s emotions and responding to intuition. Like a poet, the researcher, as well as the therapist, needs the ability to imagine what the truth might be. Each tests it, but in a different way. The poet words a couplet, the therapist tries a strategy, and the researcher tests hypotheses. A theorist, however, must be aware of all three.\u201D Right. Was that like \u2014 \u201CLike the poet, the researcher and the therapist needs to be able to imagine what the truth might be.\u201D Is that what you said? Yes. Yeah. We have to imagine what the truth might be. And I know that with statistics and with rigorous scientific methodologies, we say that\u2019s the truth, or an approximation of truth. But I think we also have to ask the right research question. And many times, we haven\u2019t been doing that. And so that\u2019s where intuition and imagination come in. Right. In the formulation of the right question. The research question. Right. That\u2019s right. Which is also a good virtue for life. Good virtue for life, it is. Well, this is what I\u2019ve learned. That it\u2019s still hard for me, given my American Protestant Swiss-American background, to deal with ambiguity. I find I need to learn daily how stressful it is, and I\u2019m reminded daily how stressful it is. And I need to learn how to become in the midst of it. I don\u2019t suppose that will ever end, but I am curious about it still. Yes, very much so. I don\u2019t like to use the word \u201Cacceptance.\u201D But I think we can try to be comfortable with what we cannot solve. Pauline Boss is Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota.
