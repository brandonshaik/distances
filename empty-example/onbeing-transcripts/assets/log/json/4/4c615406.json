  "fullText": "\u201CIn 1972,\u201D Mirabai Bush writes, \u201CI was a 30-year-old American traveling in India, with the smell of incense in my hair and mantras repeating in my ears. Back then, if you had told me that I would someday be training employees of corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful, I would have said you\u2019d been standing too long in India\u2019s hot noonday sun.\u201D Yet as soon as Mirabai Bush returned to the U.S. in 1973, she started a company called Illuminations and was featured alongside a young Steve Jobs in Fortune magazine. More recently, she helped create Google\u2019s wildly popular employee program, Search Inside Yourself. Mirabai Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers. Her odyssey from India to now tells a defining narrative of our time \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a story of tools that help us be more successful. It\u2019s a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation, in many forms and many traditions, in the secular thick of modern life. In the beginning, you couldn\u2019t ever say what the environmental leaders would call \u201Cthe L-word.\u201D What was it? They meant \u2014 \u201Cthe L-word\u201D was \u201Clove.\u201D And it\u2019s really when someone\u2019s heart opens that things really change. I have been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used to be. Because people really want to be loved it turns out. And it always edges on sounding like a Hallmark card, but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Mirabai Bush is co-founder and former director of the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society. I spoke with her in 2015. So, I wonder \u2014 how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood, of your life, your early life? Well, my early life \u2014 I was brought up Catholic. And when I was 7, my father left, and my mother had to go to work. And this was right after the war \u2014 I have to say the Second World War. OK. Right. It used to be \u201CThe War.\u201D Right. And there wasn\u2019t daycare, so my mother would drop me off at the church. And I\u2019d go to mass every morning, and then I\u2019d just go right over to the school. They were both across the street from us. So I was in church every morning for my whole childhood. And I think you know that Catholic children are \u2014 part of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of \u2014 the lives of the saints. Right. And so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of saints. But I really loved Joan of Arc. Yeah, I read that. I read that. Did you? And I think it\u2019s such an interesting idea that Joan of \u2014 I mean, how does Joan of Arc inspire the aspirations of a girl in Madison, New Jersey? Well, for one thing, her life is a lot more interesting than mine. So I liked that. But she did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl. And then the basics are that she started hearing God talking to her and telling her what to do. And as a little girl, I\u2019m recognizing how confusing life is. I thought, \u201CWow, that would be so cool if you could hear what it was you were supposed to do.\u201D Yeah. And the other thing is that she did it. She did everything she heard no matter how out there it was. She cross-dressed, and she saved France. Right. But I loved that. And so, somehow, that stayed with me, that sense of wanting to be able to hear clearly what it was I should be doing with my life. And later, when I began to learn various contemplative spiritual practices, meditation, yoga, and so on, I realized that what I loved about it was that they help you get calm, clear, open \u2014 better able to hear. It no longer seems to me like Joan experienced it as a great God in heaven speaking to her. But I feel like I\u2019ve been able to hear better what it is I\u2019m supposed to be doing with my life and then doing it. Well, that\u2019s really great, lovely language. You have a pretty amazing story of your own at this point, I have to say. I mean, digging into all the things you did along the way. And you ended up kind of rediscovering contemplative tradition, I think, in India. You got there, though it seems to me, as a child of the \u201860s and kind of driven to be moving and driven to search by your anguish at what was happening in the world. And you ended up kind of on this pilgrimage in 1969. Yes. And I think maybe later on you called it a pilgrimage, maybe at the time it didn\u2019t feel quite as defined. Yeah. At the time \u2014 I was in graduate school from \u201867 to \u201870. And those were the years that there\u2019s so much upheaval on campus, and I got really involved in civil rights and then in antiwar work. I would drive war resisters across the Canadian border. I was in the English department, and there were extraordinary people. And it was a time when people were beginning to experiment with psychedelics, and some spiritual practice, but not so much. But the whole campus was just kind of turned upside down and then the politics of it meant that the police came on to campus. And it was getting impossible. So I left just before \u2014 I had done all the work for my PhD except my dissertation, and I decided to take some time off. And I travelled overland from London to Delhi. That is like going backward in time. It was then before everything was so kind of globalized. Yeah, yeah. And it was amazing because, at that time, going through the former Yugoslavia, and Iran, and Afghanistan, and Pakistan into India, everyplace was completely peaceful. And people everywhere took us into their homes. And we took a bus from London to Delhi. It\u2019s the longest bus ride in the world. It was two months. Wow. And, yeah, and it cost like $400. Right. But we stopped in lots of places, and got to know people all along the way, and also got to have some experience of their spiritual and religious practices along the way. And that was really opening for me. And I expected to stay for two weeks, maybe, in India. We were kind searching for meaning. The first week I was there, I heard about a course that a Burmese Buddhist teacher was offering for Westerners for the first time. It was\u2026 For the very first time, right? Yeah, very first time. A meditation course for Westerners, yeah. And I did that course with many other people who are still my close friends. And there were very few Westerners then. I mean, there\u2019d been the British Raj, and then there was a big gap, and then there was us. I think you did say this a minute ago \u2014 but what you discovered, how would you talk about what you discovered in that experience of a serious introduction to contemplation, to meditation? First, you know it\u2019s hard to talk about it, so\u2026 I know, yeah. But the most basic thing, that I could look inside myself and learn about the nature of the mind and the nature of the world. And that \u2014 I was a literature student. I had read a thousand books probably. And I was always looking outside for more ideas, and more critical understanding, and more content. Ee didn\u2019t call it content then. Right, yeah. We called it literature. Right. And so just looking within was really stunning. And then that first course was from 5:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night. And little by little, I started getting really quiet and still. Of course, all kinds of things came up. But I really began to see that I was not my mind. I was not my body. I was those things, but I was also awareness. I began to see the basic nature of the impermanence of thoughts as they rise and fall away, and I just started taking them less seriously. It was really wonderful. I felt much less dependent on finding things outside, and it gave me a kind of radical self-confidence like I belonged here on the planet and that I would be able to understand the basics of how it\u2019s all unfolding. I would say that it also gave me a kind of faith in the unfolding. I like to use the word \u201Csane faith.\u201D That\u2019s what it felt like. It felt like I had a faith in actually the way things are, and that that was OK. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Mirabai Bush. Her life is a lens on a fascinating story of our time: how Buddhist meditation made its way to the West and has moved into many realms of human endeavor \u2014 also reviving contemplative practices in other traditions. Mirabai Bush actually took a corporate path out of India from 1972-1985 with her company called Illuminations. It made its name with silk-screened mandalas and other iconic spiritual symbols, and made its fortune on the rainbow decals that became synonymous with the VW beetle in its countercultural American heyday. I hear you saying \u2014 a minute ago you said you had a new insight into your mind and into the world. And those two things belong together, but I feel like in your thinking, and in the work you\u2019ve done bringing contemplative practice back out to others, you\u2019ve had a very focused way of attending to the intersection between those two things. And it seems to me that the world that has \u2014 let\u2019s use your word \u2014 unfolded in these 40, 50 years, a big dynamic in it is this these two strains of inner life and outer action kind of finding each other fitfully. Yeah. And you didn\u2019t realize that you were going to be part of this \u2014 you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids then kind of really importing Buddhism back into the West. It must be pretty amazing to think back on it now. It is. I mean, when we first came back, the idea \u2014 we were so marginalized, to put it mildly. Yeah. And we didn\u2019t quite know what to do with it, but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that, in some way or other, we wanted to, well, first integrate it into our own lives fully and then share it with others. And so most of them were single and came back and wanted to teach. Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg and a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also, who became Buddhist teachers. But when I came back two years later, I was pregnant and married and had a child then. So I couldn\u2019t \u2014 when we first came back, meditation \u2014 we still had the model of it being monastic. And so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just \u2014 no one could imagine that. So\u2026 Right. But I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into our lives in the West, so I decided to find ways to bring it. First, I started a business with my then husband, Jon Bush and\u2026 Right. Was this the Illuminations? Yeah, yeah. But what I was most interested in at Illuminations was integrating this sense \u2014 not just practice because not everybody who worked there wanted to learn to meditate. But we integrated it in ways into the business that I thought would \u2014 so the business would embody the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practices. So that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering it\u2019s all one. Yeah. I mean, now we recognize that it\u2019s more complicated, and subtle, and so on, and it is all one, and yet it\u2019s more than that. But at the time, that was radical, so we really wanted to express it. And we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people than trying to do it in words, as you can appreciate. Yeah. So we at Illuminations, we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the East, \u201Cright livelihood,\u201D where what you\u2019re making is wholesome and contributes to \u2014 now we would say sustainability of the planet and the species. And at the same time, the way in which you\u2019re doing it is helping everyone who is involved to wake up. Interestingly, we did so many things that when I, many years later, arrived at Google \u2014 because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation \u2014 so many of the same things that they\u2019ve recognized about what makes a person more creative, more able to bring their whole self into work and to be able to grow from their work as well. And not think of it as, \u201CNow I\u2019ll do my work, and then I\u2019ll go home and be a real person.\u201D Right, right. But that has \u2014 that is a shift that still has a long way to go\u2026 Oh, for sure. \u2026in terms of American corporate culture and ideals and and practicalities. Yeah. The story of Search Inside Yourself. First of all, I love the story of how you \u2014 that you had to find that language. I mean, isn\u2019t it right that, when you first just were offering a meditation course or mindfulness course, it didn\u2019t take? Yeah. Actually, my friend Meng, who\u2019s now written the book on Search Inside Yourself, he called me up one day. I was still running the Center for a Contemplative Mind. And he called up. First of all, he said, \u201CWhen I was younger,\u201D he had been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him. So he\u2019d been thinking for some time, at Google, that it would be really great to bring into the workplace. He\u2019d been there since almost the beginning. He was engineer number 107. And when Google went public, they told their engineers, who no longer needed to work if they didn\u2019t want to, that they could stay, but they had to do something that would in some way advance Google\u2019s mission. But they could decide what it was. So Meng decided it was going to be bringing meditation. And he said, \u201CI posted it, and nobody signed up. I don\u2019t know what to do, and I heard you could help.\u201D So I went out there and we talked and we looked around. And what we identified was that people, employees there are all quite young, very smart, graduated at the top of their class from MIT or Stanford, had been in front of their screens most of their lives. So, after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there, I suggested that we could offer the same practices, but emphasize the practices that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame it in a different way. And so we called it \u2014 of course, they came up with this great name since they were the big search engine \u2014 Search Inside Yourself. And then the subtitle was, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. And we asked Danny Goleman, who also was in Bodh Gaya with us back all those years ago \u2014 asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between \u2014 about why emotional intelligence is so important in the workplace and the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence. He did that, and then we posted the course, and in four hours, 140 people signed up. And since then, over 2,000 Googlers around the world have taken the course. And there\u2019s a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace, and how superficial it is, and how it helps bad people do bad things better, and it doesn\u2019t help people question anything, it just makes them more satisfied with what they\u2019re doing. But this is a serious course. And when you sit down and quiet down, become calm, quiet, stable, you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise. And it does. You do feel better, usually. Although, sometimes, really disturbing emotions arise. But it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to question, inquire. Right. But this course actually offers enough time, practice, and teaching to help people do that. I mean, yeah. I think that\u2019s an important and refreshing thing to name that you can be a great meditator and also remain narcissistic. I mean, this can be superficial and it can be abused like any spiritual practice, like any political practice. But, Mirabai, something that really so intrigues me in your work and in some of your writing is how you \u2014 like the language of emotional intelligence that you\u2019ve just been using and that\u2019s now so widely familiar, including in workplaces \u2014 that what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has this very noble lineage. It\u2019s Buddhism that is the tradition that has focused on this for thousands of years. But you wrote about how, in 1890, William James in The Principles of Psychology said that, \u201CThe faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will.\u201D And, I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think he was Buddhist, but that is the intention, right? Yeah, that is the intention. And that\u2019s just quite amazing. And then, in the \u201870s, you had somebody who actually I had never heard of \u2014 David McClelland in William James Hall \u2014 who became a teacher to all these figures who\u2019ve gone on, especially in neuroscience, to open up this field \u2014 Richard Davidson, Daniel Goleman, Cliff Saran, Mark Epstein. And also, to me, what\u2019s fascinating is that he was Quaker. And there\u2019s something in your work, there\u2019s this thread you\u2019ve pulled through in seeing that this contemplative impulse is a kind of human tradition as much as it\u2019s in the religious traditions. In Mies van der Rohe and C.S. Lewis and the idea of beholding that goes back to Plato and Heidegger, somehow that \u2014 just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me, and it\u2019s really, really fascinating. Krista, you read so much. I\u2019m honored. Yeah, but it\u2019s true. When we started the Center for Contemplative Mind, we were looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health and healing, which is where it had started. Right. And we interviewed 80 people we identified. This is in \u201896 and \u20187, so it was early. But we kind of \u2014 word of mouth\u00A0\u2014 heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrate it into their work or their organizations. And we interviewed 80 people, and we asked them for what practices were theirs and that they were teaching. And we gathered these \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 100 practices from all the different traditions. All the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions too \u2014 they are human practices. They\u2019re really about waking up to who we are, appreciating who we are, opening our hearts, recognizing compassion, recognizing that there\u2019s a way in which \u2014 there\u2019s much that we all share even with all of our differences, and that waking up to that can happen through these practices. So we created what we called the Tree of Contemplative practice, it\u2019s on the website. Yeah, no. I actually I have that in front of me. Yeah, and just put all the \u2014 sort of sorted out the practices and put them on there. And I would say, more than anything else we\u2019ve done over all these years, that has made such an impact. It\u2019s kind of like going back to the mandalas we did at Illuminations. People love to know that this basic human \u2014 that there is at the core of our being something that we all share and that we are all \u2014 the Buddhists say, \u201CEvery being wants to be happy.\u201D Everybody wants to wake up and become more fully who they are. And these practices have been developed over thousands of years. Yeah. And really, mindfulness exists in almost every tradition, but it\u2019s not called mindfulness. But there is a calming, quieting, centering practice that leads into insight in every tradition. Yeah. We\u2019ll put this Tree of Contemplative Practices online, but I just want to read some of them. First of all, there are the different branches. There\u2019s stillness, there\u2019s generative, there\u2019s creative, activist, relational, movement, ritual, cyclical. And it\u2019s everything from centering to meditation to visualization, Lectio divina, music, contemplative arts, journaling, social justice, work and volunteering, vigils, bearing witness, deep listening, storytelling, labyrinth, yoga, T\u2019ai chi, retreats, ceremonies, and rituals. It opens up this \u2014 it takes the idea of contemplative practice and awakening out of a box, out of any kind of narrow box. Yeah. When we would share the tree or start talking about the practices with all kinds of different people, almost always, someone would say, \u201COh I have a contemplative practice in my life. I walk silently in the woods on Saturday mornings,\u201D or whatever it was. The Tree helped people discover that and feel that it wasn\u2019t an esoteric or foreign thing and so then would be more open to exploring some of the other practices. You can listen again and share this conversation with Mirabai Bush through our website, onbeing.org. There, you can find that Tree of Contemplative Practices she just discussed. Again, that\u2019s at onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Mirabai Bush. She works at an emerging 21st century intersection of industry, social healing, and diverse contemplative practices. Raised Catholic, with Joan of Arc as her hero, she\u2019s one of the people who brought Buddhism to the West from India in the 1970s. She is called in to work with educators and judges, social activists, and soldiers. She helped create Google\u2019s wildly popular employee program, Search Inside Yourself. Mirabai Bush\u2019s life tells a fascinating narrative of our time: the rediscovery of contemplative practices, in many forms and from many traditions, in the secular thick of modern culture. So let\u2019s talk about where the rubber meets the road then. Let\u2019s get back down to the granular, gritty level. Where is that? Well, I want to talk about the work you\u2019re doing, the stuff you do in workplaces. And this is Google, but it\u2019s other places as well. And you\u2019ve also worked, I think, with social activists. Yeah, a lot. I just remembered, this year, the freshmen at Amherst College had to choose a three-day orientation in their first week at school. And out of 400 entering students, 70 chose meditation and yoga. So there\u2019s a big change. So the first day, I was teaching them mindfulness and having them watch their breath. They had just arrived on campus, they were \u2014 and they had worked like fiends to be able to get into Amherst. To get in, to arrive on campus, yeah. Right. Yeah. So I left a lot of space where \u2014 I\u2019d teach the practice, and then I\u2019d say, \u201CSo any reflections on that? Any questions?\u201D And there\u2019d be dead silence. \u201COK. We\u2019ll practice a little more.\u201D And then I\u2019d ask again. And nobody would make themselves vulnerable enough to ask a question. Right, right. So I decided, \u201COh, better change this around.\u201D So I decided to give them a practice mindfulness of an object. And I gave them each a leaf, and they were to bring their awareness to the leaf, and then as distractions arose, let them go, and bring your mind back to your leaf. So we did that for 5 or 10 minutes, which is a long time to look \u2014 usually, you look at a leaf, and you say, \u201COh, OK, I saw it.\u201D And then you put it down. And I didn\u2019t really expect that anybody was going to say anything. So I left a couple of moments at the end, and nobody did. And then this one football player in the back row raised his hand. And he had become, in my mind, the person who most was, kind of, resisting making himself vulnerable in any way. He said, \u201CCan I say something?\u201D I said, \u201CDefinitely.\u201D He said, \u201CI love my leaf.\u201D Wow. Wow. It was so beautiful. And then they all started talking about what it was like to really look, and look, and look. And it just made me realize that it\u2019s so much easier to do the things that we\u2019ve done \u2014 what I know that some Christian groups call \u201Ccrimes against creation\u201D \u2014 when we\u2019re so out of touch with nature. So that one moment is kind of this window into what we need to remember in order to make the right decisions for the future. It also \u2014 sometimes, I feel like we\u2019ve hit the 21st century \u2014 and I think of this as kind of spiritual technology, right? Meditation, mindfulness, and contemplation. Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re discovering all these other technologies, and then we\u2019re kind of waking up to this spiritual technology that we kind of just need to bring us back to our senses almost. I mean, I wonder a lot about \u2014 whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting, we\u2019re all on our phones immediately. We\u2019re never alone, and we\u2019re never \u2014 we\u2019re always engaged with our phones. And I\u2019m kind of starting to wonder, what did we used to do, right? Did we \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re sitting here talking about looking at a leaf, but did we look around? And I know there was boredom. There\u2019s no romance attached to this. But somehow we survived and flourished. And it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds, or inwardly then, or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in that is completely gone now. Daydreaming. Which \u2014 researchers found that daydreaming is good for your brain. I don\u2019t think we do as much of that. When teaching these students also \u2014 at the end of the day, we did the yoga and a deep relaxation. And of course, they weren\u2019t allowed to use their phones during the day, so we did savasana, a deep relaxation, and everyone who has ever done a yoga class knows it\u2019s like, \u201COK, this is the time.\u201D You completely let go, and you drop into the floor. And as soon as \u2014 breathing in and breathing out \u2014 about three breaths in \u2014 and I saw all these arms reach out. They went for their phones, and lying down on the floor, they brought their phones in front of their faces. I couldn\u2019t believe it. It was like the little Catholic girl in me thought it was so sacrilegious. Right, right, right. Well, OK, so you did all that beautiful work with Google, and Google is part of the problem here, and to the point that nothing is pure. But you\u2019ve also written about very practical mindfulness practices like social media practice \u2014 mindful emailing. Would you talk about that? That\u2019s really interesting. Yeah. We devised that at Google. Oprah loved that. She put it in her magazine. I mean, it\u2019s so simple, but like most mindfulness practices, it\u2019s so simple, and we don\u2019t do it. You just type out your email, either a response or an initiating email, and then you stop, take three deep breaths, follow your breath in and out, and in and out, and in and out, and then you read the email. And you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it. And there, we were focused on emotional impact. So, is the person likely to be agitated or angry or frustrated or whatever the emotion would be \u2014 negative emotion? Or maybe, even, is this person likely to think you mean \u2014 you\u2019re offering more than you actually are? Whatever. Right. We ask them to think about it from that person\u2019s perspective and then either change it or not and then send. And the first time we did it, there was a week in between the classes. And so a week later, they came back, and we said, \u201CHow did it go?\u201D And they all said, \u201CThat was radical. It was, like, amazing.\u201D And then one guy said, \u201CI did something \u2014 I did something really radical.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat?\u201D He said, \u201CI picked up the phone.\u201D Right. So, I mean, there. We all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle, and so that\u2019s really helpful, really helpful. I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn\u2019t answer your question about social justice activism, really. I got off on the leaf. But one theme that comes up so often with activists is that, \u201CIf I give up my anger, will I lose my motivation?\u201D And, \u201CIt\u2019s my anger that keeps me working for this change.\u201D But what mindfulness, compassion practices, and others help with is the understanding that it\u2019s not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it, on the one hand, or repressing it, on the other hand, but there is a way to notice your anger. Begin by noticing the sensations in your body, and then notice what your anger is. See it, and recognize it as energy, energy in your body. Right. But at the same time, hold compassion and equanimity for the situation because you\u2019re more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you\u2019re not driven by anger because it clouds the mind. And it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult. Whereas, if you can cultivate equanimity and compassion for the situation, you\u2019re much more likely to both see interesting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it. We did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and law students. Yeah, I was reading about that. I wanted to ask you about that. And it\u2019s so interesting \u2014 I mean, a special retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non-judgmental. Yeah. It\u2019s \u2014 I mean, we laugh, but lawyers worry that can they be a zealous advocate for their client and at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case? And, of course, the answer is yes. And what that means, and what those judges meant, is it\u2019s not eliminating wise discernment. It\u2019s eliminating prejudgment, so that they \u2014 judges are unbelievably overworked. They have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another. And they said, \u201CYou know, some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I\u2019m already thinking that this is probably who he is and what he\u2019s done.\u201D Right. And they can\u2019t not have that arise because there they are all day long hearing all this stuff, but they don\u2019t want to prejudge. They want to be really there, in the moment, clear and open-minded with whomever comes before them, but it\u2019s really hard. So just being there and really listening to what\u2019s actually being said, that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it. Mm. Yeah. I just read in a science magazine that the present moment as we experience it is about two to three seconds long, kind of interesting, right? Like physically, like what we experience as the present moment is two. And also that you can \u2014 that it can feel longer, right? Which is also something meditators have said\u2026 Yeah, absolutely \u2026and that you can also completely not be there. You can just miss it. Yes, all of the above. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Buddhist teacher, Mirabai Bush, who works at the intersection of industry, social healing, and diverse contemplative practices. Yeah, you said a minute ago, like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice, it\u2019s so obvious and in some ways easy. But we don\u2019t do it and I have to say, like for myself, I\u2019ve had many experiences across the years in different settings, retreat settings or something less intense, where the irony is that even a kind of one-off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying, right? It can be just transformative and yet \u2014 and now there\u2019s even all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that, but it\u2019s very hard to create this habit and it has been hard for me. I have recently \u2014 I wanted to ask you about this since I have you \u2014 I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my tea steeps, which just seems so pathetic but it\u2019s been\u2026 Yeah, as you said it\u2019s outside time. \u2026it\u2019s perfect. Yeah, and I wonder \u2014 I want to ask you because you work with so many different practices. I mean, is this something where you really do have to find the way that works for you? Yeah, well at the center we\u2019ve done all kinds of things. I mean, we\u2019ve had retreats where we\u2019ve offered \u2014 we\u2019ve had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices, Brother David teaching Christian practices, someone doing Sufi chanting. We\u2019ve done it that way and then invite people to find something from all of that that works for them. Sometimes we\u2019ve offered really simple practices like mindfulness of the breath and walking meditation and mindful listening and so on as an opening for people, and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate, they begin to appreciate the inner life and the benefit that comes from, as you said, I mean, it\u2019s amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels after 10, 15 minutes of meditation. Once people begin to experience that, that they will find what works for them. The other thing I wanted to say is that there\u2019s so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory practice but what I have found, in the beginning, you couldn\u2019t ever say what the environmental leaders would call \u201Cthe L-word \u201Cand they didn\u2019t mean \u201Clesbian,\u201D they meant \u201Cthe L-word\u201D was \u201Clove\u201D and there are practices \u2014 the most used is the Lovingkindness practice that Sharon Salzberg has really written a lot about. Right. And the compassion practices are related to that in which you are more about appreciation for others and a desire to relieve the suffering of others. But that whole group of practices, the truth is when I think back over all the moments of introducing these practices to all these different kinds of folks, that it\u2019s really when someone\u2019s heart opens that things really change. And you can\u2019t ever predict how that\u2019s going to happen and doesn\u2019t always happen through doing Lovingkindness practice, but I have been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices, even in just very secular working situations recently than I used to be. Like loving-kindness meditation? Yeah, because people really want to be loved it turns out, and it\u2019s hard to talk about it. It always edges on sounding like a Hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful. If you can find the right way to do it. You\u2019ve also been working with people in the army. Yeah, they want to be loved, too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, for me, going through all this, the big thing has been just when I thought,\u201DOh, I\u2019m beyond thinking in terms of self and other, it\u2019s all us.\u201D And then I\u2019m confronted with another invitation, like to the Army, and I discovered that within me, it turned out I didn\u2019t think it was all us, I thought that they were really different. This is you who drove draft dodgers across the Canadian border 50 years ago, right? Right, I was so antiwar. But as they said to me, some of them at one point, \u201CMirabai, the army doesn\u2019t take us to war, civilians take us to war. We just follow orders.\u201D Anyhow it\u2019s a long story to talk about the Army, but what I did discover is that the military has been really good at teaching people to go into a situation, to see what\u2019s going on in that situation, and then to use basically as much force as possible to eliminate any threat. Right. And that, now, is counterproductive in almost every setting that they find themselves in, and I worked with them when they were mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they had to learn to go into a situation and be aware of what was going on and then use force only as a last choice. And it took deconditioning and time and it took some real mindfulness and in the process it was really helping to support life \u2014 save life \u2014 their own and the people in the communities. And so I felt like it was a good thing to do. I mean, it sounds to me like as you\u2019ve written about that \u2014 I mean dealing with people who have been at war and are sending other people into war is kind of the extreme case of being present to suffering and not overwhelmed by it or bearing witness to suffering and not taking it on. Yeah. And I want to read back something you wrote about from your earliest days as you said. \u201CAs unlikely as contemplative practice as a strategy for social change seemed to me when I arrived in India, it slowly began to look like a critical component in the creation of a more just and compassionate global society.\u201D So I wonder if you just reflect here, as we finish, for a few minutes on, in both lofty and practical ways, about what you\u2019ve learned. Like, how can this kind of practice speak to that kind of anguish? Yeah. Contemplative practice as a strategy for social change. Gosh, it sounds like if nothing else, it might take forever. Yeah, but these things, it doesn\u2019t happen in a linear way. And there, as we\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t want to make a definitive statement about this, but we have seen leaps in terms of social change happen at different times when a tipping point is reached. But, as you ask, I realize I\u2019ve been working more with the strategy of working with people who are already committed to change and helping them do it in a better way. That\u2019s one strategy of working with people who are already doing the good work. And other people will come up with other strategies. I trust the power of these practices. I don\u2019t know about the timing, but I do know that it\u2019s one small part of helping us try to figure out how to live together.
