  "fullText": "\u201CHaving tasted beauty at the heart of the world, we hunger for more.\u201D These are words of the Nobel physicist Frank Wilczek in his book A Beautiful Question. It\u2019s a winsome, joyful meditation on the question \u201CDoes the world embody beautiful ideas?\u201D \u2014 probing the world, by way of science, as a work of art. Frank Wilczek is the unusual scientist willing to analogize his discoveries about the deep structure of reality with deep meaning in the human everyday. My experience of how his mind makes connections took off as we bantered before our formal conversation could begin: I just wrote a column for The Wall Street Journal that I thought might be interesting to discuss, but \u2026 What was it about? It was about an experience I had at the botanical garden in Phoenix, the Desert Botanical Garden. There was an art exhibit called \u201CFields of Light\u201D by Bruce Munro, which consisted of acres, in the desert, on a hillside, of lights that slowly pulsated asynchronously, and different colors. It was the nighttime. It just made me think in a different way about what it might be to wander inside a mind and what thought looks like. And to me, it was awesome. It brought together so many analogies and metaphors and ways of thinking about thinking and visualizing it. I suddenly thought that this is what thought really is. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Frank Wilczek won the 2004 Nobel Prize in physics for his discoveries about quarks that helped illuminate our understanding of the strong force, or strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature in the Standard Model of physics. Though Frank Wilczek more poetically calls the Standard Model the \u201CCore Theory,\u201D gravitational fields he calls \u201Cgeometry encoding fluids.\u201D He\u2019s a professor at MIT, and he grew up in Queens. I know you grew up \u2014 you were the \u2014 your father was an electrical engineer, radio repairman. Yes. And it sounds like you had a fascination with how things worked. There\u2019s this story you told somewhere about a coffee percolator that was one of your early memories. Yes. That\u2019s my earliest memory, I\u2019m pretty sure, is \u2026 Your earliest memory altogether? Yes. It\u2019s preverbal. I just remember it in pictures, kind of. But I remember very vividly sitting on my parents\u2019 kitchen floor, with a tile pattern, and we had a percolator, an old-fashioned coffee percolator, which had seven pieces, and you could take it \u2014 and they were big, so it was something I could manipulate, even though I was \u2014 didn\u2019t have fine motor coordination or anything. And I just was taking it apart, putting it back together, seeing that it could actually be done over and over again, and that things would fit. And somehow it was at that moment that I realized that there was a world outside, and me inside, and those were different things. It made a big impression on me and I still remember it very vividly. You talk about how you were very drawn to questions of meaning and drawn to philosophy early on, and somehow always making these connections and seeing these echoes and analogies, even in the story you just told about the \u2014 where were you? The Botanical \u2026 The Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. Desert Botanical Garden. So seeing the lights, but then also thinking about the external world and the internal world. Yes. It seems like you\u2019ve always made those connections. Yeah, I guess I have. I\u2019m just obsessed with some things. That\u2019s definitely one of them. What is the connection between experience \u2014 the inner world of consciousness and sensation \u2014 and the external world? Which kind of impinges on us, whether we like it or not, and has its own structure. Yeah. I usually begin, or very early in my interviews, will inquire about their religious or spiritual background of someone\u2019s childhood. I feel like this discussion, which is kind of organically leapt into, is kind of an answer to that. And you take up this question in your most recent book, which was published in 2015, A Beautiful Question, which I would almost say it could almost be a theological question. \u201CDoes the world embody beautiful ideas?\u201D Is that question a variation or an alternative to the question that is more commonly stated, \u201CDoes the world have meaning?\u201D Well, to me, it\u2019s clearly related. It\u2019s in the same family. It has kind of the same feeling about it. But, to me, it\u2019s much more addressable. I don\u2019t know what it would mean to say what the meaning of the world is. I\u2019m not sure what an answer could possibly look like. But if we ask this question, which sort of has the same feeling about it \u2014 \u201CDoes the world embody beautiful ideas?\u201D \u2014 I think we can get quite far in finding illuminating answers. And there\u2019s a lot of positive evidence. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s some metaphysical concept of beauty that rules the world. Beauty is a human experience, it\u2019s something that has to do with how humans react to the world and perceive the world. And it\u2019s notoriously thought to be subjective, but it\u2019s not entirely subjective. There\u2019s a very rich history of art objects and music and what people have found beautiful, and literature, and we can compare that to what scientists find in their deep investigation of what the world is, and see not whether those things coincide \u2014 they clearly don\u2019t coincide. There are forms of beauty that are not found in science and, there are facts about the world that are not beautiful. But there\u2019s a remarkable intersection, I think, and a remarkable overlap between the concepts of beauty that you find in art and literature and music, and things that you find as the deepest themes of our understanding of the physical world. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve interviewed any, say, group of people across my years of interviewing who use the word \u201Cbeauty\u201D more or who have a deeper reverence for beauty than people who work with mathematics. Yeah, and I\u2019m one. Several of the most important episodes in my scientific career have been driven \u2014 not in a vague way, but very concretely \u2014 by wanting to make things beautiful. I remember almost a magical moment when I was speaking with one of my colleagues after a seminar trying to figure out what this seminar meant. It was about fractional charge. It was a very difficult seminar to understand. Neither of us really did. But then I tried to write an equation which captured the way it should work, and the equation almost wrote itself. And it was just so pretty that I knew it had to be correct, and that turned out to be the key to a very important investigation that\u2019s still ramifying through physics. I think when one talks about mathematical beauty, or beauty as revealed through mathematics and physics, that can sound lofty and abstract to many people. You make a wonderful observation that I think is just so useful in terms of letting people in, which is that our brains are attuned to the deep structure of the physical world in ways that we don\u2019t even \u2014 can\u2019t even begin to grasp. And when it comes to beauty and our perception of beauty, or our perception of reality, in fact, our perception of the physical world, you say, \u201CEach of us is born to become an accomplished, if unconscious, practitioner of projective geometry.\u201D So explain what you\u2019re describing there. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s one of our most impressive abilities, that humans, children, do routinely without thinking about it \u2014 although they have to learn it, or parts of it \u2014 and, yet, we have not been able to teach sophisticated computing machines, computers, to do it. That is, humans do an astonishing feat routinely and very quickly. That is, they interpret the messages coming through little, little openings in their eyes and project it on a two-dimensional screen, the retina at the back, which then \u2014 the light gets turned into electrical signals, and from that crazy, scrambled encoding, we reconstruct an external world of three-dimensional objects in space. We recognize that if we move our head they\u2019re still the same objects, and we determine these effortlessly. We do a job which is \u2014 it literally is impossible. We use all kinds of tricks and rules of thumb to guess what the external world is, and sometimes it\u2019s wrong, with optical illusions. But basically, in most circumstances, we do this remarkable feat of reconstructing a three-dimensional world from two-dimensional information that\u2019s all scrambled up with things on top of each other. Through these eyes that we just take for granted, completely and utterly take for granted. We take it for granted, but nature has equipped us with extraordinary abilities in geometry. I knew this abstractly, but in preparing the book I decided I should actually learn something about perspective and projective geometry. And it was a real revelation. I\u2019m terrible at drawing, just terrible. The worst person I\u2019ve ever met. But I learned some of the rules of perspective that artists, use and they are just so beautiful. They\u2019re so elegant. And using them, I was empowered to create accurate buildings and town squares and so forth. And I wasn\u2019t able to reproduce it consciously, but now, with knowledge, I was able to do it. And it was just magic to suddenly see these things emerging from geometric construction, and it looks like the external world. And it had a tremendous effect historically and psychologically when these rules were discovered in the Italian Renaissance. It\u2019s one of the things that really powered the Renaissance \u2014 the artists took enormous joy in their sudden ability to render the world the way it actually looked. But that is so interesting, again, to point that out, that what we \u2014 most of us, it would be impossible to think about creating perspective, which is essentially creating a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional space. Yes. But we don\u2019t realize that we do that in our \u2014 when we open our eyes constantly without being aware of it, and how complex and amazing that is. Yes. And people who started to work on artificial intelligence thought at the beginning that would all be trivial, because it\u2019s so easy, and we don\u2019t have to work very hard. They thought that would be very easy, whereas, say, teaching a computer to play chess would be very difficult. But it\u2019s turned out to be just the opposite. The things that we do unconsciously and are part of our daily lives and are important for survival are things we\u2019re really, really good at. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, exploring beauty with Nobel physicist Frank Wilczek. So symmetry is an important notion in the perception of beauty for the human brain. I want to tease out \u2014 I believe, and I want to make sure I get this right, that you\u2019re saying that Einstein\u2019s \u2014 what you call his \u201Cnew style in physics\u201D \u2014 helped bring symmetry home, in a sense, or helped us understand the importance of symmetry, or symmetry as an aspect of reality. How would you say that? Well, \u201Csymmetry\u201D as used in common language is kind of a vague word. It means \u201Cbalance,\u201D \u201Charmony,\u201D \u201Dgoodness.\u201D Somehow it has nice connotations. Yeah, I liked the way you said it\u2019s also fairness. But it\u2019s also vague. We even \u2014 symmetry, ethical symmetry, we look for. Fairness, yes. Yes, proportion. But in science we need to have a more precise concept, and the concept that we use that\u2019s more precise that has something in common with the common usage, but is a special case of it, and gets amplified in different directions, is that symmetry in physics and mathematics means change without change. Now that seems kind of mysterious and mystical but it means something very concrete. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity \u2014 it says that if you ride by the world at a constant velocity, any constant velocity, although things will look different \u2014 so some things will be coming at you, other things will be moving away, faster \u2014 the same physical laws will apply to this new configuration of the world. So you can make a change in the way everything looks, but you don\u2019t change the laws. A simpler example might be helpful here. We\u2019re used to the idea that a circle is a very symmetrical object. What does that have to do with change without change? Well, a circle is an object that you can rotate around its center by any angle, and although it might have changed, and every point, in fact, moves, the circle as a whole does not move, and that\u2019s what makes it symmetric. If you take a more lopsided shape and you rotate it, there\u2019s no way \u2014 it won\u2019t come back to itself until you go all the way around. So if you take an equilateral triangle it\u2019ll come around after you turn it one-third of the way, so it has some symmetry, but much less than a circle. So that\u2019s a concept, change without change, things that might have changed but don\u2019t, that picks out special kinds of objects, like circles. It turns out that very symmetric laws are laws that seem to be the laws that nature likes. Nature likes laws and likes equations that support enormous possibilities for transformation, where things look different, get different names and different situations are described, but the same equations apply. So, is it right? Did I read that you owned and lived in the house Einstein lived in, in Princeton? Yes. Throughout the 1990s we did. So that would have been the house where he invited Marian Anderson to come stay when she came to sing in Princeton, and it was a segregated city and she couldn\u2019t stay in any of the nice hotels. Yes, that was the house, all right. Yeah, amazing. It\u2019s a nice house. Good. I\u2019m glad she had a nice place to stay and so did you. It doesn\u2019t look large from the street, but it\u2019s very, very long. It\u2019s a big house, and has a beautiful yard. Yeah, I liked it very much. I want to actually point out that you \u2014 there was a piece on December 31 in The Wall Street Journal where they asked a number of thinkers what to expect in 2016, and that you predicted that we would soon detect gravitational waves, which, again, you, I feel, more poetically called \u201Ctremors in spacetime.\u201D And, in fact, you were proven correct very soon. Yes. I didn\u2019t have any inside information, but I did know what was publicly available, that this instrument was going to acquire enough sensitivity to plausibly detect sources that were very likely to be out there in the universe. So I wasn\u2019t completely confident that it would be found in a year. I was very confident it would be found in a few years. But as it happened, it was a matter of months after I\u2019d made the prediction. And it\u2019s a great event for physics, and a culmination of a great \u2026 Was that an exciting day for you? What was that like? Yeah, definitely. It was a beautiful, poetic day, because many narratives come together. It was 100 years ago that Einstein, from very abstract intuitions of beauty and coherence, wrote down the modern equations for gravity, his general relativity theory, which has been the pattern for many of our successful theories later, including our theory of the strong interaction. And this gave a new picture of what gravity is due to, and it\u2019s due to warpings in space and time, an extraordinary concept that space and time themselves can be bent. And then, as part of it, excitations in space and time can take on a life of their own. Those are gravitational waves that move out, spread like ripples on a pond to far away. So, in principle, things that happen way over there can transmit, through these waves, information very far away \u2014 like light waves, but it\u2019s a different kind of thing you\u2019re sensitive to. But the effects were predicted to be so small that Einstein himself had no hope that they would ever be detected. It\u2019s another part of the extraordinary progress in physics that we\u2019ve learned. The technology has advanced so that we can detect extraordinarily small, subtle effects. But the fact that physics has advanced to the point where you can master nature so well as to detect such tiny effects reliably is just an extraordinary tribute to how well we\u2019ve come to understand many things about the world. And kind of in your lifetime, that advance and that change. Yes. It\u2019s actually scary. It\u2019s a hundred years back to the origin of the prediction of gravitational waves, and I\u2019ve lived through more than half of that. I still think of myself as a kid, but it adds up, you know? [laughs] You can listen again and share this conversation with Frank Wilczek through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with an exploration of beauty, the deep structure of reality, and deep truths in the human everyday, with Nobel physicist Frank Wilczek. His book A Beautiful Question is a long meditation on the question, \u201CDoes the world embody beautiful ideas?\u201D This physicist has a poetic way of seeing and naming reality \u2014 even scientific truths and observations. Somewhere you say \u2014 this is, again, such helpful imagery \u2014 you say Einstein describes space time as elastic and not rigid. And then you describe it as a \u201Cubiquitous cosmic Jell-O.\u201D It\u2019s an image that\u2019s helpful. I like to try to think very concretely, although to really be accurate in modern physics, we deal with very abstract concepts that are far removed from daily life. But I always try to visualize it in many different ways, including things that are very low-brow. Right. Like Jell-O. Yes. OK. So let\u2019s go deep and profound again. You talk about Niels Bohr\u2019s notion of complementarity as something you\u2019ve come to treasure. He was, of course, a Danish physicist and philosopher and interlocutor of Einstein, you could say. Oh, he\u2019s one of the great pioneers of quantum mechanics. Yeah. And quantum mechanics. He\u2019s one of the few people you could think of as Einstein\u2019s peer. Right. And they had a complex relationship in terms of \u2014 it seems, huge reverence for each other, but also often disagreeing profoundly. Yes. They both had deep intuitions about how the world should work, and they weren\u2019t the same intuitions. To oversimplify quite a bit, I would say Niels Bohr had a very humanistic interpretation. He thought that physics was about describing human knowledge of the world whereas Einstein thought more at the level of God\u2019s knowledge. He often talked that way a lot. It\u2019s very majestic. Very majestic, and humans are just observers of this preexisting harmony, and they should be awestruck and humble. Their role was passive, not in \u2026 But, almost, to that give-and-take, that seeming conflict \u2014 which, in fact, was as much collegial as it was conflicted \u2014 you have such an interesting way of talking about complementarity that I feel is evocative in human terms as well as scientific terms. One of the things you say is that \u201Cin ordinary reality and ordinary time and space, the opposite of a truth is a falsehood.\u201D But, you say, \u201CDeep propositions have a meaning that goes beyond their surface.\u201D This is so interesting. \u201CYou can recognize a deep truth by the feature that its opposite is also a deep truth.\u201D Yes. So one of the conflicts was, is light a particle or wave? And, in fact, it is both. It\u2019s both, and\u2026 It\u2019s both, right. \u2026sometimes it\u2019s useful to think of it one way. Sometimes it\u2019s useful to think of it another way. And both can be informative in different circumstances. But it\u2019s very difficult, in fact, impossible, to apply them both at once. To apply them both at the same time. And I think that\u2019s the essence of complementarity. You have to view the world in different ways to do it justice, and the different ways can each be very rich, can each be internally consistent, can each have its own language and rules, but they may be mutually incompatible, and to do full justice to reality, you have to take both of them into account. Somewhere you say, \u201CComplementarity is both a feature of physical reality and a lesson in wisdom.\u201D I think what you just said about reality is equally true of \u2014 and I know you have to be careful to do too much of this stretching these things \u2014 but it\u2019s equally true of the human condition. Oh, very much so. Oh, I think so. When people ask me what my religion is, I say I\u2019m a complementarian. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s so\u2026 I believe that it\u2019s really interesting and really fun and really informative, and the right thing to do to be able to look at things in different ways, and appreciate there are different ways of looking at things that each have their own validity. And they may conflict if you try to apply them both at once, but, OK, that\u2019s fine. You apply one at a time and try to appreciate both. And in terms of this \u2014 I have spoken with physicists who will say \u2014 of course they take their daily perceptions seriously on some level. They understand that, essentially, what we perceive to be reality is full of illusion, including the perception that we have freedom and choice. But you also present this as another piece of complementarity. Two things that, in fact, are true, but hard to speak about in the same moment. That you, as a human being, are nothing but a collection of particles and light, and you are a thinking, feeling human being. Yes. I think those are both true. They are different ways of organizing our experience of the world, and each one tells us important things. Each one can be very useful in certain applications, but they\u2019re very difficult to apply simultaneously, because they\u2019re just from different worlds. Then there\u2019s some virtue, some intelligence in living with that seeming\u2026 Yes. \u2026impossibility or contradiction, which I guess human beings don\u2019t like. We don\u2019t like that kind of uncertainty. Well, I like it. You can come to like it if you \u2014 and, as I said, I think that\u2019s a bit of wisdom. One aspect of it is just to be able to put yourself in the other fellow\u2019s shoes. Right? But it applies much more broadly. You use words a lot like \u201Cparadoxical,\u201D \u201Ccrazy,\u201D \u201Cstrange\u201D to describe reality and what you study, and it seems to me that those words also go together with beauty, right? That the richness of it is also in notions like that. Yes. Well, one of my notions about the human concept of beauty is that beautiful things are things that evolution has primed us to enjoy and want to come back to and feel pleasure in experiencing. And one thing that has that nature is learning things that are useful in getting around in the world. So things we can learn from, new experiences that can help us in other endeavors give us pleasure, and learning about the world and learning about how strange it is and then \u2026 And being taken by surprise in ways that advance us that we couldn\u2019t have imagined before. Being taken by surprise, learning things is expanding your concepts, your power, your appreciation of the world. So I think that is beautiful. It\u2019s intrinsically beautiful to learn things. It\u2019s pleasurable, yeah. Especially if they\u2019re surprising, because then you get to expand your mind. If you think about what happens at a modern particle physics accelerator like the LHC or, even better, its predecessor, the LEP, the Electron-Positron Collider, what happens at an accelerator like that is that people do the same thing over and over again. They collide electrons and positrons with exactly the same properties, exactly the same energy, many, many times, and you get different results each time. You get different kinds of things come out of the reactions. Einstein said \u2014 or was reputed to say, I guess it\u2019s disputed whether he actually said it. He said, \u201CInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different answer.\u201D It\u2019s so good. But that\u2019s exactly what happens! That\u2019s exactly what happens. Even with this, with him. Right. You say in your book, A Beautiful Question, that if there is a creator, if you were to ponder it in that way, that that creator is \u201Can artist above all.\u201D Yes. That\u2019s what I think may be the most poetic way of stating this conclusion, that the world, in large part, does embody beautiful ideas, that if you regard the world as a work of art, first of all, it helps you understand things, and secondly, it\u2019s a pretty good work of art. It has tremendous beauty. It has tremendous creative power in using a few principles to make elaborate structures. It\u2019s a wonderful thing. I was thinking, as I was preparing to speak with you, that I had an interview years ago. It was in the early post-9/11 years with a great Muslim legal scholar. A kind of jurisprudence in Islam is what theology is in Judaism and Christianity. He was a legal scholar, and then a rabbi. There is a notion in Islam that beauty is a core moral value. Are you familiar with that? I\u2019m not, but what I am familiar with is that mosque interiors are, to me, among the most exuberant expressions of symmetry and celebrations of concepts that turn out to be central to the deep description of the world. It\u2019s very impressive, and of course they\u2019re just beautiful to look at. Right. But I think it\u2019s a reflection of a deep piece of theology, and the rabbi came back with this notion that\u2019s in the Hebrew bible about the beauty of holiness. And we had this amazing discussion that night about taking on the very serious and heavy conflicts in which religion is not just involved, but implicated. Yes. But imagining beauty as a litmus test of whether something is of God, and then they had a very complex understanding of beauty \u2014 that it\u2019s creative, and not destructive. It\u2019s a beauty of wholeness, not fractionalizing. Well, I think it would be a very healthy thing, as well as a very rewarding thing for religious traditions to focus on, where they\u2019d find a lot of common ground, and also rich possibilities in exploring the concept of beauty. I think it would also be very helpful and very healthy and very stimulating to bring in science there, because science, especially modern physics, has taught us some really, really surprising and wonderfully imaginative and beautiful and fantastic things that are aspects of the actual, physical world, and presumably in a religious interpretation are aspects of God\u2019s work that are by no means obvious. And you really have to expand your mind to appreciate them. And, to me at least, it gives a real feeling of spiritual growth and depth when I deal with these concepts. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with Nobel physicist Frank Wilczek. There\u2019s a passage in A Beautiful Question, I just wanted to read it. It\u2019s a scientific corollary to that idea of beauty as a litmus test, as a guide, even for you in terms of science\u2019s limits and imperfections. You say, \u201CDespite its overwhelming virtues, the core theory is imperfect, indeed precisely because it is such a faithful description of reality. We must, in pursuit of our question, hold it to the highest aesthetic standards. So scrutinized, the core theory reveals flaws. Its equations are lopsided and they contain several loosely connected pieces. Furthermore, the core theory does not account for so-called dark matter and dark energy. Although those tenuous forms of matter are negligible in our immediate neighborhood, they persist in the interstellar and intergalactic voids and thereby come to dominate the overall mass of the universe. For these and other reasons, we cannot remain satisfied.\u201D And then you say, \u201CHaving tasted beauty at the heart of the world, we hunger for more. In this quest there is, I think, no more promising guide than beauty itself.\u201D Yes. Well, I put my money where my mouth is. I have theories for what the dark matter is that I think are certainly driven by beauty and, well, we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re true. And I have theories about states of matter that I\u2019m very confident are correct. They\u2019re driven by beauty, but haven\u2019t yet been verified experimentally. It\u2019s what drives a lot of my work in physics, is trying to get more beautiful equations and a more coherent description of how things work. And it\u2019s been successful in the past quite a bit, and so it has a good record, not only in my work, but in the work of my community and colleagues. So I think we\u2019re on a roll, and let\u2019s hope it keeps going. George Dyson said something when he was looking at your book that you\u2019re kind of in the lineage of natural philosophy that was before what we now just call science. Yes, I feel that way. Yeah. And I really hear that. I\u2019m a throwback. Yes. And that, in fact \u2014 that gets a bit at what we spoke about in the very beginning, about this quest for meaning, or these questions of meaning that helped draw you into science, and that, in fact, that is there on scientific frontiers, and it\u2019s often not acknowledged or analyzed. Yeah. Well, I think it has dangers. It has dangers of woolly thinking and wishful thinking and denial of facts that you don\u2019t like. But I think it\u2019s throwing out the baby with the bathwater not to realize that that\u2019s really a central element of human life and should be a central element of the scientific worldview to try to understand things whole, and bring everything together and use what you learn about the physical world to inform your view of the world as a whole. You have to use it perhaps in the spirit of complementarity, not try to\u2026 Tie it up neatly. \u2026not try to use it to deny other ways of looking at things. But to appreciate them all in different aspects and enrich your concept of what reality is. I think it\u2019s woolly if you are working with a simplistic form or definition of the search for meaning\u2026 Exactly. \u2026just like beauty can be a woolly concept if you\u2019re using it simplistically and superficially. Exactly. So the challenge is to use them creatively and precisely and to stretch them and test them and push them as hard as you can, and see if they keep holding up and keep working and keep being creative and fruitful. For our last few minutes here, I want to \u2014 I pulled out some observations you make, some insights you have about this way that you see the world, you see reality and truth, and also are always, I think, in some way, bringing together these profound human quests for both understanding reality and having a sense of meaning. And I just wonder if you\u2019d just kind of bring us in a little bit to this way of seeing. So, for example, you talk about how Newton had described each spectral color as distinct. Yes. But in the next chapter of physics, there was this discovery of, as you say, \u201Ca deep unity beneath and supporting the diversity of appearance.\u201D And you said, \u201CAll colors are one thing\u201D \u2014 this is what we learned \u2014 \u201CAll colors are one thing\u2026 Yes. \u201C\u2026seen in different states of motion, and that is science\u2019s brilliantly poetic answer to Keats\u2019 complaint that science unweaves a rainbow.\u201D Yes. Well, this comes back to the theory of relativity. So what you learn in the theory of relativity is that when you look at a light beam of a different color, and you\u2019re moving towards it, it gets shifted towards the blue end of the rainbow. So if it was red, it might become yellow, or green, or blue, or ultraviolet if you\u2019re moving fast enough. And if you\u2019re moving away, there\u2019s what\u2019s called the redshift. Things move towards the opposite end of the rainbow, towards \u2014 so all these colors can be derived from one of them by moving at an appropriate velocity. So really the existence of one implies the existence of all the others. Of all of them, right. And the properties of one imply the properties of all the others. So in a really deep sense, they are the same thing. But in a complementary sense, if you don\u2019t move, they\u2019re all different. I said to you earlier on that your question \u201CDoes the world embody beautiful ideas?\u201D almost could sound like a theological question. For example, the theological observation of Reinhold Niebuhr, one of the great public theologians of the 20th century talking about how the great struggle of human life is this anxiety that we feel because we\u2019re torn between our experience of mortality and our perception of eternity. And you said, \u201CWe humans are poised between microcosm and macrocosm, containing one, sensing the other, comprehending both.\u201D Yes. What are you saying there? Well, I\u2019m saying I guess that by understanding the world better that you gain a new perspective on what you are, and a different feeling about your place in reality that\u2019s more realistic, also richer, and there\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news. Right. It\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s something you can \u2014 by understanding it deeply, you can certainly enrich your experience of the life you\u2019re given. Yeah. You also cite somewhere what you say is, for you, one of the most beautiful passages in literature from the 20th-century physicist Hermann\u2026 Hermann Weyl, yes. \u2026Weyl on spacetime. He\u2019s talking about spacetime from a \u201CGod\u2019s-eye view.\u201D Yes. \u201CThe objective world simply is. It does not happen.\u201D Yes. \u201COnly to the gaze of my consciousness crawling along the lifeline of my body does a section of this world come to life as a fleeting image in space, which continually changes in time.\u201D That\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s almost a mystical image. That the world is, it does not happen is quite a remarkable thing to try to take in. Yes, but it\u2019s really, I think, very much what the theory of relativity suggests. It\u2019s really basic to think of spacetime as a whole, because there are relationships between things that happen in different parts of space and at different times that are significant in forming the laws and the regularities of the world that are very, very difficult and awkward to express if you carve the world into time slices as we experience\u2026 Right. Past, present, future. \u2026and regard them as separate and unrelated \u2014 or as snapshots, each a thing in itself. Relativity teaches us to think of spacetime as a whole, and that it\u2019s very unnatural to divide them. So it leads, I think, very much to the worldview that Hermann Weyl was alluding to there, that the world, that is, spacetime, it simply is. It does not happen. It already encompasses all times. So this is an idea that we don\u2019t feel in our bodies. Yes. We humans have the fate \u2014 which is a gift \u2014 that we can get beyond the limitations that nature imposed, that evolution imposed on us. We really can get beyond that by thought. We have the gift of being able to understand things, and go deeper, and get beyond common perceptions. We can use instruments. We can use logic. We can learn from each other, and traditions, and there are many surprises that get revealed. And it just enormously deepens life to participate in that. I listened to an interview you gave on the BBC. It was actually a music program. Do you remember this? Oh, yes. It was lovely. Well, I think so. Yeah. Well, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to ask you to quote back from it. Oh, I know. Yes, I know what you mean. Yes, where we went through different favorite pieces of music. Different favorite pieces of music. And at one point you said \u2014 I think you were quoting Newton, how he said he felt at some point in his life is how you feel. It was an analogy of feeling like a boy on a beach. Do you remember that? Yes. Yeah, oh, it\u2019s a very striking quotation of Newton, and I think very sincere on his part. So he said that \u2014 I think I can quote it close to literally \u2014 he said, \u201CI know not how I appear to the world, but to myself I appear like a boy on a beach who came upon some particularly beautiful pebbles, while the great ocean of the unknown lay before me.\u201D So he realized that he understood some things very well, and he understood what it meant to really understand something, but at the part of that is realizing that you don\u2019t understand a lot of things, and there\u2019s a profound humility that comes from really understanding something, because then you understand what it means to really understand something, and you realize how much is missing, that is different. And you feel that way as a physicist at this juncture in physics, which is so far from what Newton could have imagined, also. Yes. We\u2019ve done very, very well. Physics is pretty good. Physics we\u2019ve attained a high level, although there are certainly big holes in our understanding. But when it comes to the mind, when it comes to understanding society, our understanding is much, much less satisfactory. I\u2019m fully aware of that. In closing, I wonder if you could start to talk about \u2014 how would you begin to reflect on, through the science you\u2019ve done, and especially, I think, this focus on your sense of beauty, and beauty as a guide, as a litmus test \u2014 how do you think you move through life differently? Ordinary space and time, the flawed way we perceive it? Well, I think it\u2019s made me much more tolerant. Because so many things that bother a lot of people seem trivial to me. That and the lesson of complementarity, the idea that you can put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes, it\u2019s very, very helpful in dealing with the human comedy and \u2026 Your truth may be true, and my truth is true, and that can just be. Yeah. And I can appreciate you for what you are, even if you\u2019re annoying. [laughs] I can have the fun of trying to understand where you\u2019re coming from even if I don\u2019t approve of it. Having a wider view, an expanded mind. But then also another very important thing is that several hours a day, I get to think about how beautiful the world is and how it might be made even more beautiful by enriching our understanding of it. So that\u2019s a very special gift, and I\u2019m very grateful that society has paid me to do this, and that I\u2019ve been able to do it, and that I\u2019ve had some talent and been able to do it in a successful way, in some cases. I think that that sense of fun and delight \u2014 it\u2019s not an austere beauty. I know there\u2019s austere beauty in mathematics, but a lot of what you\u2019ve been describing, it\u2019s passionate and whimsical. Yes. Well, people have different styles but mine is that way. I\u2019m a sunny kind of personality. Yeah, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way people think of a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, right? Well, I know enough about Nobel Prize-winning physicists to know that they come in all shapes and sizes and they don\u2019t have all that much in common, not even intelligence. But, yeah, all of them have in common a certain kind of honesty, and a certain kind of community, and they\u2019ve all contributed in some significant way to human knowledge and culture and understanding. Do you think they all have some sense of beauty as some kind of guiding principle, even if they wouldn\u2019t express it exactly the way you do? Yes. I think you have to, at some level, in some form, have the feeling for how things might be different and better in order to make a great discovery. I think you can be lucky, but even if you\u2019re lucky and stumble into something, you\u2019ve got to realize that it\u2019s something, and that you should pursue it. And that is usually driven by some feeling for beauty, and that this thing is significant, that this thing fits into a larger picture. Making a discovery is not just stumbling into something. It\u2019s realizing that you\u2019ve got it and bringing it to the world, and that requires a perception of its beauty.
