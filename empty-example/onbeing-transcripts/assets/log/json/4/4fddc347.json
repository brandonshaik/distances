  "fullText": "Theoretical physicist Lisa Randall started out seeking answers to questions in Standard Model physics and ventured into pondering extra-dimensional worlds. Now, she\u2019s moved into illuminating what she calls the \u201Castounding interconnectedness between fields which have previously operated more autonomously \u2014 astronomy, biology, paleontology.\u201D She\u2019s pursuing a theory that dark matter might have created the cosmic event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs \u2014 and hence humanity\u2019s rise as a species. We explore what she\u2019s discovering as well as the human questions and takeaways her work throws into relief. You know, it\u2019s OK to be aware of our limitations as human beings \u2014 that these are things that make it harder. It doesn\u2019t make it impossible. And that\u2019s the beauty of science. Is that we can go beyond these prejudices, if you like, these intuitions that we have built on our ordinary, everyday experience. That allows us to think about things that seem obviously wrong. They\u2019re not obviously wrong, they\u2019re just not obvious to us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Lisa Randall is the author of best-selling books for non-scientists, and she is the Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University. It was interesting for me to read that you grew up in Queens, and that you\u2019ve said that as a young girl you were more entranced with books like Alice in Wonderland than the scientific books you came across. I actually don\u2019t think I came across that many scientific books as a kid. Yeah. Basically I went to the library and read what I could. I just enjoyed reading. I liked the sense of adventure and play. Mm-hmm. But, yeah, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m really one of those people that said I really wanted to understand the stars. We didn\u2019t actually see that many stars where I was. I think it was later on that I really came to appreciate nature more. Really starting, probably, in graduate school when I started hiking and exercising more. Mm-hmm. I have to say, looking at the website at Harvard \u2014 it\u2019s the Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature, the High Energy Theory Group. So I am totally not responsible for that name, which I find really arrogant and obnoxious. I mean \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re responsible for the fundamental laws of nature. I think we\u2019re responsible for the laws of nature that we can understand. Yeah. It is \u2014 it\u2019s very lofty. It\u2019s not just lofty, it\u2019s misleading. I think it\u2019s misleading. Mm-hmm. Because I think it gives this nature of science as, we have this starting point, and then we derive everything. But really that\u2019s not how it works. I mean, we try to find the starting point. We conjecture some theories. But we also try to work backwards to see what we observe, and trying to see how those pieces fit together. So it\u2019s really a push and pull. It\u2019s not just one. That\u2019s such an interesting way to state it. Here\u2019s something you wrote. \u201COur world is rich, so rich that two of the most important questions particle physicists ask are, Why this richness? How is all the matter that I see related?\u201D And I just wanted to ask you to explain what you\u2019re describing there. What does \u201Crichness\u201D mean in the context of what you do, in that sentence? Well, I think part of what I\u2019m referring to is simply the fact that we really don\u2019t know how to explain why certain particles are essential to the world we live in. We know, for example, that nuclei have what we call \u201Cup\u201D and \u201Cdown\u201D quarks inside them. But there are heavier versions. What role do they play? We know there are electrons, but they\u2019re heavier versions of the electron, known as the muon and the tau. So there\u2019s particles beyond what seem essential to nature or us or life, and we don\u2019t really understand why they\u2019re there. I mean, there doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a reason, but we\u2019d like to see, is it somehow essential to getting us to this point in the world? So that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m referring to there. Mm-hmm. So richness is just that variety of particles and qualities\u2026 I mean, there is of course\u2026 \u2026that\u2019s known and unknown. \u2026also the richness of how the pieces fit together, which is the wonderful stuff that we observe in the world. And we can see how that fits together and how that came about and try to understand that with science over time. So it\u2019s kind of twofold. It\u2019s sort of the richness at the fundamental level, but it\u2019s also the richness of the complexity that derives from that, those simple ingredients. And it seems that the period in which you have been a scientist, these last few decades \u2014 when did you get your Ph.D.? I hate having to answer that because it gives away my age. But I got my Ph.D. in \u201887. But I will remind you that I took three years as my undergraduate and four years as a graduate student. All right. All right. But what I\u2019m getting at is just how, you know \u2014 it\u2019s a short list, just call it a very short period of time, you\u2019re young, it\u2019s a handful of decades \u2014 but the scientific understanding of that richness that you were just describing even in this period has been so evolutionary. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s been a very exciting time to be a physicist. I kind of joke that I lived in the optimal time. I think some guys might say they would have liked to have been around earlier, but I think I\u2019m at a very good time, because not only is science exciting, but it\u2019s also a time that allows you to be a woman physicist a little more easily. Yeah. So I feel like I live in the optimal time for me being a physicist. But I think also in terms of physics, I think the last century has just seen amazing developments. I mean, cosmology wasn\u2019t truly a science until the last century, until Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, and observations improved to the point that we could actually see what\u2019s going on and make predictions. Particle physics really only developed, nuclear physics \u2014 all the physics I worked on is a product of basically the last century. You know, it just occurred to me. I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to ask this question, because I feel like I should understand it, but I feel like the word \u2014 the language of cosmology and physics gets interchanged, at least in non-science circles. I mean, how do you distinguish between those things? So the other thing that gets confused is astronomy. So let me just try distinguish\u2026 Yeah, yeah. \u2026all of them. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So physics, I think of as the fundamental laws of nature. So, for me, physics is elementary particle physics, but there\u2019s all sorts of physics, which are sort of the rules by which things work. Cosmology is a specific science. It has to do with how the universe itself evolved. It has to do with the Big Bang theory, the theory of cosmological inflation, all of which I talk about in my latest book. Yeah. But it has to do with how things evolved to where they are today. Astronomy is more, in a sense, looking at stars, and looking at the actual objects, how they develop, putting together. So what I like to think is, physicists are looking for sort of fundamental ingredients, astronomers are putting them together in a particular way to describe what we see today. And cosmology tells you how we got to this point. And of course, they all intertwine. They\u2019re not completely disconnected. But someone will usually identify as an astronomer, or a cosmologist, or a physicist. Yeah, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Good that you asked. A lot of people \u2026 Well, I, you know, I just suddenly realized \u2026 I always get mislabeled, actually, so it\u2019s pretty funny. Yeah. So, let\u2019s just leap in. Let\u2019s just go to dark matter. And this book you\u2019ve written this year also has this wonderful title, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs. Thank you. And let\u2019s do some definition of terms up front. I mean, dark matter is, we now believe, perhaps 85 percent of the matter in the universe. Just start there. How would you talk about \u2026 So, you know, people get very disturbed about the idea of dark matter. They say, \u201CHow could there be all this matter that we don\u2019t see?\u201D But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that we don\u2019t see. If the history of physics has taught us anything, it\u2019s \u2014 or biology or any other field of science \u2014 it\u2019s how much we don\u2019t see. Right. And dark matter, I would have \u2014 if it was up to me, I probably would have called it transparent matter. It\u2019s matter that doesn\u2019t interact with light. Dark stuff, as you know, absorbs light. So you see it. But dark matter, it\u2019s matter. It interacts with gravity like the matter we know. It clumps. It\u2019s around here in our galaxy, but it doesn\u2019t interact with light. So we literally don\u2019t see it. We see its gravitational effects, but we haven\u2019t seen other effects. We know it\u2019s there, because of the many gravitational influences of large amounts of dark matter. But an individual dark matter particle has so far eluded detection. I mean, let\u2019s clarify what ordinary matter \u2014 when we usually say matter \u2014 non-dark matter is. So it\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s all around us. It\u2019s all matter. It\u2019s all part of\u2026 The stuff that\u2019s in\u2026 \u2026what we\u2019re made of\u2026 \u2026people. \u2026it\u2019s part of Earth. It\u2019s people. It\u2019s the galaxy. Mm-hmm. But there\u2019s also dark matter surrounding us. It\u2019s just a lot less dense in our vicinity. Nonetheless, there\u2019s billions of dark matter particles going through us all the time. Right now even. We just don\u2019t \u2026 OK. Yep, right now. Mm-hmm. But we don\u2019t see them. And they don\u2019t interact with us. We don\u2019t feel them. We don\u2019t smell them. They don\u2019t interact with our senses. People are trying to devise very clever ways to look for very subtle, small effects, but so far as we know, the dark matter is not interacting with us a whole lot. It\u2019s interacting via gravity, but gravity is actually a very weak force at a fundamental level. That\u2019s why you need large amounts of dark matter to observe its effects. And you say that while dark matter is mysterious to us, it\u2019s not necessarily such a mysterious thing. I think what you\u2019re saying \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily such a mysterious thing that it exists. Well, I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s rather egocentric to think all matter should be just like the matter that we\u2019re made up of, and that looks just like our matter. I find it, in some sense, remarkable that the matter we know about is as significant a fraction as it seems to be. You know, about five percent of the energy in the universe is ordinary matter, whereas 25 percent is dark matter. I find that remarkable. I mean why isn\u2019t it a tiny, tiny fraction? And the fact that we don\u2019t see it \u2014 I mean, why should everything interact with light? The fact that we interact with light \u2026 Right. It\u2019s a kind of mistake people make all the time. We think we overcame that with the Copernican Revolution. We have a more open perspective. But we still have to get it knocked into our heads every time that things are not just the way we see them in our daily lives. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with theoretical physicist Lisa Randall. Her latest book is Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe. You have spun this speculative scenario, which is based on real science, in which dark matter might ultimately have been responsible for the extinction of the dinosaur 66 million years ago. Describe that scenario and how you came to it. So, it\u2019s actually really fun for me, because it\u2019s one of the reasons I decided to write a book \u2014 because I do work on very fundamental, very abstract science: the Higgs boson, or an extra dimension of space, or fundamental particles. But there was this fun thing that dark matter actually does contribute to the structure of the galaxy \u2014 ultimately is responsibility for the fact that things get dense enough that we can form stars in our world. So I liked taking those connections. But in the science itself, we came at this somewhat indirectly. And I should mention my collaborators Matthew Reece, JiJi Fan, and Andrey Katz. Mm-hmm. We were actually trying to explain how you could get a signal that matched some data. We knew the data actually might be spurious. I will confess that right from the beginning. But they saw a lot of photons at the same energy. And there was no standard dark matter explanation that seemed to do this well, that explained why you\u2019d have photons and not other things, including the charged particles. So we were trying hard to say, how can we make a model, a conjecture for what dark matter could be, that could explain the signal? And then we turned it around and we said, you know, maybe it\u2019s just that dark matter is a lot denser than we thought it is. Now, we have a lot of evidence that dark matter is spread out in a diffuse spherical halo in the galaxy. But we said, maybe some of the dark matter is like ordinary matter. Ordinary matter is not spread out in a spherical halo. Mm-hmm. Ordinary matter sits in the Milky Way plane. So it\u2019s much denser than it would otherwise be. And the reason is that ordinary matter can radiate. It can cool down. And because it can cool down, it\u2019s in some sense making smaller excursions, so it gets concentrated in this sort of pancake-shaped region, that mid-plane of the galaxy. So we said, maybe dark matter \u2014 not all the dark matter, just a fraction of the dark matter \u2014 does the same thing. Maybe a fraction of the dark matter can radiate and also form a plane in the galaxy. And in fact, we realized this remarkable thing that if dark matter particles are heavier than the proton \u2014 I realize this is getting somewhat technical but\u2026 No, it\u2019s OK. Keep going. \u2026it would be a thin disk in the Milky Way plane. And that would be extremely exciting and interesting. First of all, it would have observational consequences. But second of all, what would happen is that as the solar system orbits around the galaxy, it bobs slightly up and down, it weaves slightly up and down, as it goes around in its mostly circular path. And so what we proposed is that every time it passes through this dense, dark matter, just the tidal force is strong enough that it could dislodge comets that are weakly bound. Now, comets are, in fact, very weakly bound in the distant Oort Cloud, which has been in the news lately, so maybe people have heard of it. But it\u2019s 50,000 times further away than the Earth is from the sun. It\u2019s very far away. And for that reason, the force of gravity is much smaller than it is for us here on Earth. And so that means that it\u2019s weakly bound. And if you have a strong enough tidal force, it could dislodge a comet. So our proposal is that every 30 or 35 million years, there\u2019s this extra tidal force that dislodges comets from the Oort Cloud, and explains the periodicity of large comet hits. Hm. This is not completely established. The statistical evidence isn\u2019t extremely strong, but there is some evidence that this happened \u2014 large hits happened on a periodic basis of around that time. And since the one that killed the dinosaurs happened 66 million years ago, maybe it was one of these comets. It was an enormous, 10- to 15- kilometer object coming, speeding down on a planet and caused the extinction. So we propose this is what triggered it. So now are you working with this hypothesis and investigating it, and trying to solidify it? Well, it\u2019s very hard. I mean, the evidence for the periodicity comes from craters on the Earth. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s a great thing, you can look at the Earth impact database and see all of the ones that have been found. There is now something called the Gaia satellite that\u2019s measuring the position and velocities of a billion stars. And that will essentially create a 3-D map of the galaxy. Mm. We\u2019ll learn more about the galactic plane. So if, in fact, there is this dense dark disk, there should be evidence for it in this data, which will be really exciting. Wow. In fact, it was an amazing thing, because when we proposed this, we weren\u2019t astronomers. We didn\u2019t even know about the Gaia satellite. We were so excited to realize that the measurement we would have asked them to do was actually going to be happening, right. And it launched the fall that we had actually proposed the idea, so it was\u2026 When do\u2026 \u2026very nice timing. \u2026you expect that data to be there? It should be coming in the next few years. It\u2019s probably a five-year mission, so\u2026 That\u2019s exciting. Yeah. And one thing that I\u2019m doing now with a student is actually analyzing similar, but not as accurate data from the old Hipparcos satellite, which is similar in spirit, and trying to see what kind of constraints you get from that. Mm. I would like to talk \u2014 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come back to dark matter. I would also like to talk about the way you\u2019ve worked with and thought about extra-dimensional worlds, which \u2014 one of the things you say is that \u2014 again, kind of clarifying for laymen \u2014 that imagining other dimensions is not probably like our favorite sci-fi dramas, which I love. You know, where my lifetime is happening somewhere else with other endings and other pathways. It\u2019s that they\u2026 Yeah. \u2026would just be very different realities. Is that your understanding? Well, I think that, certainly what I imagine is \u2014 you know, you could have the kind of things that I talked about in extra dimensions where particles and forces we know about are stuck on an object called a brane, B-R-A-N-E, which is like a membrane-like surface\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026in a higher-dimensional space. The particles and forces that are stuck here could be different than particles and forces that\u2019s other places. And you know, it\u2019s not entirely different from what I\u2019m saying about dark matter just to tie together. Yeah. Because what I\u2019m saying there is that there could be different forces. It could be a different kind of electromagnetism. It could be a different type of charged particles. I mean, the fact is that if there are other worlds, even if they\u2019re in the same place, there could be other universes in some sense right here with different particles, different matter, different interactions. Just like there can be different forces and particles in other places along an extra dimension. I loved in your \u2014 what was the book that had \u201Cwarped\u201D in the title? Warped Passages. Warped Passages, yeah. There\u2019s a quote at the very front of the introduction from the Beatles song. \u201CGot to be good looking, because he\u2019s so hard to see.\u201D You know, getting permission for all those quotes was a pain, and probably the Beatles one was probably the most painful. Was it? But I just love that quote. But I just love that quote. Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s good. I loved, actually, abusing all the song lyrics. It was really fun. Yeah, you had others. I, you know \u2014 one thing that you say that I experience again and again in my conversations, I think especially with physicists, is that physics is more creative and fun than people would possibly guess on so many levels. I mean, there\u2019s actually a joy in it. There\u2019s kind of a whimsy that you bring in with quotes like that, but that still make sense. And also this speculative leap that you\u2019re making in order to investigate in a kind of hard, scientific way. Right. What I like to think of \u2014 the most interesting kind of creativity is sort of constrained creativity, where you have some rules. I mean, it\u2019s not just true in science, it\u2019s true when you make a movie. I have friends who make movies. You know, there\u2019s certain formulas that you have to stick to at some level, but within that framework, can you make it interesting? Can you see how things fit together in more complex and surprising ways? And that\u2019s where the creativity comes in, trying to figure out \u2014 you have these elements, but how can they be connected? Is there some link that we\u2019re missing? And then once you have that, you have to be creative about figuring out, how will we know if this is true? What are the predictions that you would make that we wouldn\u2019t be making otherwise? And how can we test them? So I definitely think there\u2019s a lot of creativity. I mean, there\u2019s certain kinds of physics where you\u2019re just working things out, but there\u2019s certain types of physicists who are thinking about new ideas a lot. Yeah. And that\u2019s what I like to do. I was just thinking about a neuropsychologist I interviewed who\u2019s studying creativity in the brain \u2014 and creativity as distinct from intelligence. And one of the things they measure \u2014 one of the measures of creativity is actually humor, because it is, in fact, about making unexpected connections. You know? I think that\u2019s totally true. Yeah. In fact, I have a movie reviewer friend who had actually talked about Robin Williams in this context. Mm. And talked about the amazing connections he made and that was part of his humor, was this incredible wordplay. Yeah. And I do find that a lot of kind of math-y people I know are really \u2014 enjoy wordplay a lot, too\u2026 Yeah. \u2026because it\u2019s also these bizarre connections\u2026 Yeah, kind of\u2026 \u2026that you might not have anticipated. \u2026making those unexpected connections, and then, you know, I think about leaning into them with joy. Leaning into them \u2026 And I\u2019m certainly guilty of that, too. I know. Actually I think we\u2019re going to get\u2026 I get accused of making nerdy jokes\u2026 \u2026to that in a little while. \u2026a lot. Yeah. You know, you write that once or twice in your life \u2014 in the course of your life, when you\u2019ve told someone what you do, that you\u2019re a cosmologist, and they\u2019ve had no idea what that is, they\u2019ve thought you meant cosmetologist. . That\u2019s actually happened. But then you go on to make this wonderful \u2014 you investigated the fact that those words both actually come from, derive from the Greek word \u201Ccosmos,\u201D and then you say, \u201Clike a face, the universe has both beauty and an underlying order.\u201D Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I actually was thrilled by that, that that is why these words are related. And it does have to do with the kind of order and beauty, that they\u2019re associated with both of them. I wanted to just \u2014 I do sense that search to find that order \u2014 just that sense of adventure, also, about finding that underlying order is in all your work. But\u2026 I know. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I insist that the world should make sense. Yes. It\u2019s amazing. But you also say we shouldn\u2019t be obsessed with the theory of everything. Well, that goes back to what I said earlier about fundamental laws. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think we make advances. Making advances doesn\u2019t mean that we have the fundamental answer. It doesn\u2019t mean we have the ultimate answer. Even if we did have the fundamental theory, it doesn\u2019t mean we would have everything worked out. It doesn\u2019t\u2026 Yeah. \u2026mean we\u2019d understand life because we have the fundamental equations. You\u2019d still have a long way to go to understand a lot of the science that follows from those equations. So there\u2019s two places where I think it\u2019s a problem. One is, do we even have the fundamental equations, and second, once we have them, what are all the consequences? So, I prefer to think of it in terms of sort of working backwards, step by step, as we understand more, as we study more, trying to make connections we have a chance of really solidifying, seeing if they\u2019re right. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t play around with fundamental theory, see what the consequences are. But I don\u2019t think we want to do that to the exclusion of the kind of science that\u2019s more traditional science. You can listen again and share this conversation with Lisa Randall through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with theoretical physicist and author Lisa Randall. We\u2019re exploring her discoveries, and also the human questions and takeaways she reveals in her writing on subjects from dark matter, to dinosaurs, to extra dimensions. As I was reading through your various work, I wrote down some ideas, quotes, that seem to kind of epitomize some of the interesting ways you think about science, or that you make science somehow explicable. Thank you. What a lovely thing to do. Well, and that you clarify in ways for non-scientists that I think are unusual. So, here\u2019s one. You talked about the research that led to the Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs book \u2014 that there were some inspiring lessons from that research. And you said the first inspiring lesson was that the earth has a love/hate relationship with its environment. So talk about that \u2014 what that means for you. Well, I think one of the amazing things about the fact that we can have life on Earth are just the amazing \u2014 you can call them coincidences, but whatever \u2014 the amazing conspiracies that have to happen. I mean, we want to be close enough to the sun to be warm and have energy. We don\u2019t want to be so close that we\u2019re just going to be zapped out by all these cosmic rays or whatever. Not cosmic rays, but just radiation. We want to be protected from cosmic rays from the outer solar system, so the outer planets maybe help us. We need a carbon cycle here on Earth. You know, one of the amazing things is the fact that plate tectonics are contributing to the carbon cycle, and plate tectonics are driven by nuclear energy in some sense. There\u2019s nuclear decay inside the earth that\u2019s heating it up, and the plates can rotate. I mean, there\u2019s just an astounding number of amazing connections that led to the fact that all these things can happen. But like I said, we need to be protected from all the dangerous things. Yeah. And not only rays, but you know, there\u2019s comets, and asteroids\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that hit us. If we were being bombarded all the time, that would kill any life that was formed. So we also have to be protected from stuff that\u2019s falling in. Yeah. A lot of the environment would kill off life, but some of it is obviously essential. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to. Yeah. You point out \u2014 there\u2019s kind of a corollary to physics and cosmology being explicable to non-scientists, which is analogous to how we have trouble understanding biological evolution. I mean, and Darwin was aware of this, that it\u2019s very hard to talk to people about things that happen in the course of geologic time, that our brains simply can\u2019t go there. And you talk about how the scales of the cosmos, and of physics are, on the one hand, so enormous, or so unfathomably small, that they\u2019re so removed from our experience, that this is one reason it\u2019s hard for people to take in a lot of what\u2019s of science. I think that\u2019s true. The distinction I would make is that it\u2019s not unfathomably hard. It\u2019s hard. OK. So I think, it\u2019s OK to be aware of our limitations as human beings, that these are things that make it harder. It doesn\u2019t make it impossible. And that\u2019s the beauty of science is that we can go beyond these prejudices, if you like, these intuitions that we have built on our ordinary everyday experience, and understand what\u2019s going on in regimes that we don\u2019t usually deal with. And that\u2019s the beauty of mathematics. That\u2019s the beauty of science\u2026 Right. \u2026is it allows us to think about things that seem obviously wrong. They\u2019re not obviously wrong, they\u2019re just not obvious to us. It\u2019s a wonderful way of thinking about the tools \u2014 the capacity that science and technology create for humanity. Well, I really think so. And I think there\u2019s just important lessons to be learned. I mean, I think we very often think that what\u2019s obvious is correct, and forget that what\u2019s obvious has to do with our senses, has to do with how we perceive the world. And it\u2019s not just a lesson for science. I\u2019d say it\u2019s also a lesson for social interactions, too. We\u2019re familiar with our social groups and we forget that other people\u2019s experiences are different. Or if we remember, we just find them unfathomably difficult to understand, as you would say. But they\u2019re not unfathomably difficult, we just have to make a little bit more effort. Mm-hmm. You point out some things that \u2014 sometimes when you speak, there are things we know and there are things we don\u2019t know, which are really fundamental. I think this gets at your point that scientific progress is in part about working back. So you know, you\u2019ve said, \u201CWe talk about the Big Bang, but we don\u2019t completely know what banged,\u201D which is an interesting phrase. That\u2019s right. Yeah. Or that \u2026 We don\u2019t necessarily have to know. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t study the Big Bang theory. Yeah. That tells us what happened after the bang happened, whatever that was. How the universe expands, how the universe cools, how structure forms within that universe \u2014 all those are questions we can answer, and we can even look for evidence in the formation of galaxies and stars. And, I mean, you even point out that it\u2019s not just that we don\u2019t understand dark matter. There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t understand about ordinary matter. Yeah. That\u2019s actually almost a joke, but at some level we do understand it. We understand that it\u2019s made up of elementary particles. We understand the forces through which it interacts. But what we don\u2019t understand is why the matter has survived to today. We know that matter, what we say, annihilates with anti-matter. It turns into pure energy. If you have a quark, it gets together with what we call an anti-quark, and can turn into energy. For us to have the universe we see today, there has to be more matter than anti-matter. And we don\u2019t know fundamentally how that came about. Mm. And that\u2019s a really important question. And it\u2019s a really fundamental question, because it means symmetries that you might have thought are obvious are violated. The fact is, plus-charge is not the same as a minus-charge. So, the question is, why is this true? What happened in the early universe? And there\u2019s ideas for what happened. In fact, I\u2019m working on some of them today. Mm. But it\u2019s still a very important and interesting question. Is that question related to the question of what banged at the the Big Bang? Probably not, but it might have to do with what happened after things banged\u2026 OK. \u2026in the sense that we, in some sense, from a practical level, we can consider cosmological inflation as the effect of the Big Bang, something that we\u2019re pretty sure happened, where things expanded exponentially, quickly. Mm-hmm. And so the question is, what was the temperature at which that happened? What was the energy? And so it could be related to that question. So many people who work with mathematics across the years have talked to me about beauty, beauty as a kind of \u2014 that litmus test of whether something is true. And you say somewhere \u2014 you know, beauty and elegance. You say that for you simplicity is a better guide than beauty. And I wondered if you would elaborate on that. Yeah, well, I have a chapter in Knocking on Heaven\u2019s Door called \u201CTruth and Beauty and Other Fundamental Scientific Misconceptions.\u201D Yeah. I don\u2019t think that beauty is as much of a guide as we think it is, because, as you know, we all think different things are beautiful. And also, even what an individual thinks is beautiful changes over time. You know, there\u2019s some ways in which Einstein\u2019s theory looks really beautiful, but there\u2019s other ways, if I told you what the equations looked like, and what the solutions look like, you\u2019d think it was a bloody mess. So, I mean, you can frame things so that they seem more beautiful than they are, or less beautiful than they are. For science to be meaningful, you want to have as few ingredients as possible to make as many predictions as possible with which you can test your ideas. So I think that\u2019s more the sense \u2014 I think that\u2019s what people are thinking of. And simplicity, by the way, isn\u2019t always beauty. Sometimes complex things are a little more interesting. So is beauty a factor for you? I mean, I experience it to be kind of a motivating force for a lot of people in science. I would say that there\u2019s a sort of fundamental satisfaction that I find when I find connections, when things you thought were separate could be related. Mm. Is that a form a beauty? I mean, probably. I mean, I could define it that way. Yeah. And there certainly is the sense in which, I\u2019ll be sitting in a seminar, and someone will say something that\u2019s technically natural, and I\u2019m like, \u201CYeah, but it\u2019s ugly.\u201D So clearly, I do care \u2014 I mean, look, writing books takes away a lot from my time to do science, but there is a sense in which I kind of do recognize that if I\u2019m going to tell you about this, and you\u2019re going to make faces, it\u2019s probably not a beautiful theory and might not be the answer. When you have something beautiful, on the one hand, we all have different ideas, but on the other hand, there\u2019s some things that we probably would agree on. And so one of the tests of whether something is beautiful is, you know, can I tell it to you with a straight face? I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with theoretical physicist and author Lisa Randall. You write in the Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs book about dark matter debates that you were part of, a conference. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And this gets back to, I think, the fun for you in being a scientist. So there\u2019s Occam\u2019s Razor, which is the idea that the simplest\u2026 Mm, yeah. \u2026explanation is probably true, which scientists work with. Which, as you say, is not always right, but often is a good guide. And so, would you explain this? So, in the course of this conversation \u2014 I think it\u2019s a paragraph in your book, and you\u2019re talking about it \u2014 some discussions among you and some other scientists, there was Occam\u2019s Razor, and somebody proposed \u201CWilson\u2019s Scalpel,\u201D and you proposed \u201CMartha\u2019s Table\u201D as guidelines. And I just wonder if you would share that. Well, I think, you know, when people use Occam\u2019s Razor, they don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve so narrowed the playing field a lot of the time. They focus on a particular problem, and they say, can you solve this problem? And yes, you could probably have a simple theory that solves that one particular problem. But if you can\u2019t fit it into a larger context, that\u2019s probably not the right scientific theory. So, I joke about \u201CMartha\u2019s Table,\u201D that you want a complete table setting, that you don\u2019t just want\u2026 You\u2019re talking \u2014 you\u2019re referring to Martha Stewart, right? Yeah. Even if it\u2019s a very complex table, if it\u2019s \u2014 it could still look orderly and nice, and you know, you can have the tools to address all the different meals you\u2019re going to be served. Mm-hmm. And, you know, the universe is a complex place with a lot of phenomena you want to explain. So, you can\u2019t just narrow down only on one particular problem. Of course you can do that as a temporary thing. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re trying to explain the larger set of phenomena. And it goes back to what you were saying earlier. That it\u2019s \u2014 you don\u2019t want to get so overly focused on one problem that you lose track of the fact that it\u2019s part of this larger world. I think this also gets at something else you wrote, that\u2019s a simple sentence but strikes me as very important, that we often fail to notice things that we are not expecting. Yeah. I think that it\u2019s so hard to believe, but \u2014 and I think going out in nature helps you see that a lot \u2014 someone will notice some animal that just went by. And they\u2019re like how did you not see it? It was right in front of you. But you just weren\u2019t looking. And I think that\u2019s just true of so many things in our daily lives. I mean, I have an apartment in Manhattan, and when you look up, you see all sorts of interesting architectural details that you don\u2019t see when you\u2019re at eye level. You know, you sometimes just have to look around or you miss things. And I think the world is full of surprises. And we\u2019re surrounded by them. But we often miss them. And it\u2019s fascinating to think about applying that, then, to this sphere in which you\u2019re working in particle physics, and thinking about extra dimensions, and dark matter. You\u2019re saying that this\u2026 Well, I think\u2026 \u2026same holds true. \u2026it\u2019s not just important for me\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026but I think it\u2019s important for telling experimenters what to look for. You know, they have very complex experiments. Unless they know to look for something, it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019ll miss it. Yeah. It\u2019ll get caught up in the background of all the buzz of all the other stuff that we know is there, but doesn\u2019t tell us something new. So you want to really think about the specific things that you\u2019re looking for to make sure you don\u2019t miss them. And that\u2019s one of my roles as a scientist, and as a model builder. Mm. So, I want to read, and this is kind of a longish passage from the Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs book. Just because I think it\u2019s wonderful and I\u2019m going to ask you a question. Thank you. And this research is kind of bringing together insights from astronomy, and biology, and paleontology, in addition to the things you always think about. And you said, \u201CI was awestruck and enchanted not only by our current knowledge of our environment \u2014 local, solar, galactic, and universal \u2014 but also by how much we ultimately hope to understand from our random tiny perch here on Earth. I was also overwhelmed by the many connections among the pieces that ultimately allow us to exist. To be clear, mine is a deeply unreligious viewpoint. I don\u2019t feel the need to assign a purpose or meaning, yet I can\u2019t help but feel the emotions we tend to call religious as we come to understand the immensity of the universe, our past, and how it all fits together. It offers anyone some perspective when dealing with the foolishness of everyday life.\u201D And so I wanted to just kind of drill down into that a little bit, and ask, you know, that perspective that you have from the science you do \u2014 can you just talk a little bit about what form that takes? Like how being steeped in these ideas and discoveries and questions shapes the way you move through the world of ordinary matter that we\u2019ve also been talking about. Well, it\u2019s funny because I mean, I\u2019m a pretty observant person, but I can also have blinders sometimes and just focus on what I\u2019m interested in, and I think it\u2019s important to do that if you want to make progress in what you\u2019re doing. You know, it\u2019s funny, when I was at MIT, one of the staff people, who I hardly knew \u2014 I guess she maybe did entries \u2014 and she came over and said, \u201CI notice that you seem to be able to\u2026\u201D \u2014 because, you know, there are obviously issues at any university. She was like, \u201CI notice you manage to be able to ignore all those things and just focus on what you\u2019re doing.\u201D And I was just really surprised. I was like, \u201CHuh.\u201D Because, I certainly didn\u2019t feel like I was ignoring them. I was pretty aware of them. But there is some sense in which you have to have some perspective and say, you know, what\u2019s important? And, you know, for some people those details are important. But I like to think that there\u2019s fundamental truths that we might be learning that are, in some sense, more important. And those are worth drilling down and really focusing on. Mm. So, sometimes I\u2019ll laugh and I\u2019ll think about, like, suppose there were creatures in other planets and they read our newspaper or they watched our TV. I mean, what would they be thinking? I\u2019m not saying they would always have negative conclusions, but it\u2019s just fun to think of, you know, someone who\u2019s outside all the details, outside of all of this. I mean, will they really be as excited about the new iPhone as people seem to be? Right. You know\u2026 Yeah. \u2026like, will they really notice a difference? That looks pretty much the same to me. So, that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t all get caught up in it. But I think it is sometimes important to think, what are the really big places where we\u2019re making advances? You are really \u2014 you are a scientist\u2019s scientist, in addition to being a translator, you know, for the rest of us. But I also really feel like your work is so interwoven with your being, and there\u2019s a joyfulness, there\u2019s such a lightness to it. It\u2019s not all intellectual. I kept thinking of \u2014 do you know Karen Armstrong? She\u2019s a scholar of religions. Mm-hmm. Yes. And she\u2019s a former nun. She was a nun. And she\u2019s \u2026 I remind you of a nun. That\u2019s interesting. No. OK. Well, here\u2019s what \u2014 [laughs] No, here\u2019s what it reminds me of. Is it \u2014 I asked her once, because she had been a nun, but now she\u2019s not a nun anymore. She left the cloister. She\u2019s a scholar and she\u2019s a thinker. And she said that she thinks of her work now as her prayer, like her scholarship, her thinking, her study. And I don\u2019t know, this may be a real stretch, but I just wondered if there\u2019s anything in that that reminds you of you. Not that you would\u2026 You know, I\u2019m \u2026 \u2026use the word \u201Cprayer.\u201D It\u2019s really funny. And I\u2019m so the opposite of that in the sense that I try not to take myself overly seriously. OK. I mean, of course, you know, if you ask people around me, they probably would disagree. But I\u2019m not thinking in those terms. I\u2019m thinking about, like, what is the problem I\u2019m trying to solve? Like, is there an answer? Is this a credible answer? I mean, do I feel satisfaction in doing it? I\u2019m not trying to label it. I\u2019m not trying to say \u2014 I\u2019m not trying to say, am I building a cathedral? I\u2019m just saying, like, does it work? And you know, the fact that it can add up to something more is fun. And one of the joys of writing a book is being able to take that step back and say, look, this is why it\u2019s interesting. This is why it\u2019s important. This really is saying something about our world. But in my day-to-day existence, that\u2019s not how I\u2019m thinking about it. Mm-hmm. I guess I\u2019m not really thinking about how you think about it, but how it feels. Like how you carry it. I don\u2019t know, does that make sense? Like I said, I think there\u2019s some sort of satisfaction in making connections. Mm-hmm. You know, solving a problem. I mean, you know, you finish a crossword puzzle. OK, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve advanced the world, but there\u2019s a satisfaction in that. There\u2019s a satisfaction in winning a game of chess. It\u2019s \u2014 we all feel this satisfaction, winning games, or solving problems. And it\u2019s somewhat like that. Mm-hmm. But it\u2019s something that I think has more meaning, something that you obviously are going to be working on for a longer time. You have some deeper, more developed connections among all the different ideas. And there is a sense of play in it in addition to all the seriousness about it. Because some of the ideas will be true and some won\u2019t be true. But it\u2019s fun to figure out how we\u2019re going to know what they are, what are the possibilities, which are the ones that work, which are the ones that don\u2019t work. And maybe deep down I\u2019m taking it as seriously as everyone, but I think as soon as I start saying that to myself, I think I would be afraid. And I think it\u2019s just much better for me to think of it as sort of a little bit of a game. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty amazing to think about just this one thing that we\u2019ve talked about that you\u2019re working on now. The nature of dark matter, and if you do indeed \u2014 are indeed able to make a connection between a new understanding of dark matter and this extinction event that has shaped\u2026 And also to be clear\u2026 \u2026life on the planet. \u2026it\u2019s not just one thing I\u2019m working on. Yeah. I mean there\u2019s different possibilities for what dark matter can be. Mm-hmm. And I\u2019m working on different ones that aren\u2019t even necessarily all consistent. I want to know what the answers are. So it\u2019s fun to think about what the possibilities can be. And there\u2019s something I wrote down somewhere you wrote\u2026 Oh, here. I like this. \u201CWhen it comes to the world around us, is there any choice but to explore?\u201D Thank you. That\u2019s kind of a good mission statement. Exactly. I like that. Yeah, there we go. Thank you. I wish I could \u2014 can I get this list of quotes? It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m like, wow, I said that. That\u2019s great. I can send my notes if you want. Yeah, no, it\u2026 Awesome. \u2026was a lot of fun. That would be fantastic. Those would be great talking points. Thank you. Yeah. Well, and so, just my final question. I, you know, you do \u2014 so, I find \u2014 let me just say this. I think \u2014 weren\u2019t you in Brian Greene\u2019s same high school class? No, Brian Greene was in my class. Oh, sorry. He was in your class. Yeah, got it. No, it\u2019s the same thing. I\u2019m just joking. Yeah, I know, I know. So, you know, I had a conversation with \u2014 a public conversation with him once, and I think he was being provocative and playful, but, you know, really kind of resisting the reality of all these things that are our intuition \u2014 that, in fact, are proven to not be true by science. I feel like you \u2014 you\u2019re very clear in saying, you know, there\u2019s what science and its objectivity and its complexity can see. And then there\u2019s the reality of how we, as human beings, are and how we interact with the universe. And these things are just \u2014 they\u2019re just different. I would say it slightly differently. OK. I would come back to the notion of an effective theory. Here\u2019s a simple example. Or not simple, but just one example. Are Newton\u2019s laws correct? Well, we know Newton\u2019s laws are not fundamental. We know that quantum mechanics is more fundamental. We know that relativity is a more fundamental theory. But Newton\u2019s laws happen to work incredibly well over a large range of parameters. And that is to say we can send a man to the moon based on Newton\u2019s laws. So for that purpose, they are correct. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the ultimate reality, if you want to say it that way. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s kind of very helpful in thinking about a lot of philosophical questions, a lot of scientific questions. The notion of an effective theory, it really adds depth and meaning, and helps us understand these questions, because it\u2019s saying, within this realm that we\u2019ve explored so far, what are the rules that work? And when we go beyond that, what are the rules that work? So that\u2019s more how I\u2019m thinking about it. And would you say that at present there are lots of things about biological life, about our brains, for example, and about the ecosystem that is a human being, that we can\u2019t explain or can\u2019t address \u2014 and are you just \u2014 you\u2019re OK with that? Of course not. I\u2019m a scientist. I want to understand everything. OK. But what I would say\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is that \u2014 so I just want to make the distinction. Yeah. It\u2019s \u2014 so there are some things that we \u2014 like, we have optical illusions. Yeah. And they are illusions. We can see they\u2019re illusions. So yes, our senses sometimes deceive us. That\u2019s one thing that happens. Another time we just don\u2019t have access. So, for example, dark matter, we don\u2019t see in our daily lives. Does that mean that we\u2019re crazy to think that we only have real matter? Well, to all intents and purposes, in many ways, we\u2019re only interacting with ordinary matter. So we can forget the dark matter for a lot of the things we do. Not for the things I do, but for the things you\u2019re doing. But I do think the beauty of science is that it can tell us the distinction. It can tell us when\u2026 Mm. \u2026are we really making a mistake when we think our intuition is right? So when does it matter? And again, I would argue that this goes beyond the scientific realm. Things that are obvious are not always obvious. Sometimes they\u2019re just familiar. And sometimes it helps to have objective ways of codifying whether or not those things are true at a more fundamental level. So what would an example be? Just a really standard example. Well, I mean, a stupid example is all the scientists are men. You know, there was a time when all the scientists were men, but like that\u2019s no longer true. Right. Right. So it\u2019s just, you know, it has to do with a whole bunch of circumstances, societal circumstances that created that. But, you know, if you were observing what it was like 200 years ago, you might have come to that conclusion, and thought, well, it\u2019s obvious. Yeah. So it\u2019s not obvious. Yeah. Yeah. So, the question I actually wanted to ask you out of this is, this question of what it means to be human. You know, how you would start reflecting on that, and in the sense of how that\u2019s evolved as your scientific work and perspective has evolved. I know, it\u2019s huge. Yeah. That\u2019s kind of a huge question. Yeah. I was thinking, oh, just one little question to end the \u2026 No, you don\u2019t have to give a comprehensive \u2014 just how would you start thinking about that? You know, I guess I would think about how I interact with the world. What that is at a fundamental level. What my senses can perceive. And then how I interpret that information, how I try to form a bigger story. You know, I think the influence of time is really important. How that story changes over time. Yeah. I think that\u2019s one of the really interesting questions. How does the you today connect to the you that you were when you were younger? I think that\u2019s a really important question. When did you become you, you know, in the sense\u2026 Yeah. \u2026of when did your thoughts and memories develop to a point where they\u2019re distinct? So I guess I would try to break it down to smaller questions so that I could compare, say, one time to another time, maybe the way I say something to another human being. I mean, you know, there\u2019s so many fundamental things we don\u2019t know. I mean, when I see something blue, am I seeing the same thing that you\u2019re seeing? Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s just so many questions about what it means to be human that I sort of don\u2019t know where to begin, but on the other hand, I would begin at any one of these places and they probably all could give you some answers. Yeah. The idea of time \u2014 I feel like this is one of the most interesting, profound places where science just, physicists in particular, just see the world differently than the ordinary experience that most of us have. Oh, I would just say nobody understands time. That nobody understands time. Yeah. I remember talking to Paul Davies a long time ago about Einstein, and he talked about the notion of \u201Cblock time,\u201D that essentially somehow everything is actually happening at the same time, but we can\u2019t perceive that. Yeah. Do you believe that? Doesn\u2019t seem to be true. I don\u2019t know. I mean I think about it sometimes. I try to imagine\u2026 It\u2019s awfully deterministic. I don\u2019t know. Yeah. It seems to me that there\u2019s a little bit more randomness in the world. Yeah, so I mean, how do you think about \u2014 I mean, I love those questions you just framed about the me that was then and the me that is now, and what time makes possible. I mean, how do you think about time as an element of human becoming? Or does that\u2026 Well, I mean\u2026 \u2026even make sense? \u2026there\u2019s sort of a practical element of just how things change over time. Yeah. I think, it\u2019s interesting as people study aging. I mean, this is sort of a depressing idea, but when I think about the question of the soul it\u2019s just interesting, because when you see someone who\u2019s on the verge of death, or has Alzheimer\u2019s, or is really sick, I mean, is that the same person they were before? I mean, so where\u2019s the soul? Is that the person that\u2019s going to survive? I mean, it just seems like it shows you how difficult these concepts are to really define in any way, which is why I pretty much don\u2019t believe in it. But I do think it forces you to think about what it means to be a human being, and what it means to be about a particular human being. But there\u2019s time associated with people, and there\u2019s times associated with abstract physical processes. I can talk about extra dimensions of space, but we don\u2019t know how to talk about extra dimensions of time, really. Yeah. And certainly ones that we overlap with. So time seems to be this thing by which we measure progression, but how that got defined in the first place, I think, is a very difficult question. Mm-hmm. Is mystery in your vocabulary? The language of mystery? Oh sure. Yeah? Sure. So is solving. OK. Lisa Randall is the Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University.
