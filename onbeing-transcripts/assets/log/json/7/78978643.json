  "fullText": "My faith life, like that of everyone else, fluctuates. There are ups and downs and hot spots and cold spots and boredom and ennui and all the rest can be there. And so I\u2019m not asked on a Sunday morning, \u2018As of 9:20, what do you believe?\u2019 And then you sit down with a three-by-five index card saying, \u2018Now let\u2019s see. What do I believe today?\u2019 No, that\u2019s not what they\u2019re asking me. They\u2019re asking me, \u2018Are you a member of a community which now, for a millennium and a half, has said, we believe in one God?\u2019 The late great historian Jaroslav Pelikan knew that the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed was troublesome for modern people. He had a gift, which we remember this hour, of clarifying the past for the sake of the present and the future. He even insisted that strong statements of belief will be necessary if 21st Century pluralism is to thrive. Pelikan was one of those people relatively unknown in the wider culture, but a living legend in his world of accomplishment. And my conversation with him is cited by listeners from an astonishing range of belief and non-belief as one of their favorites. I met him in 2003 \u2014 the first year of this show. He had just compiled a historic collection of creeds from biblical times to the present and from across the globe. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Jaroslav Pelikan was a professor of history at Yale University for over four decades and a president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his many books, he wrote five epic volumes, the defining work of the 20th century, on Christian tradition. The formulas we know as the creeds of the Christian Church were hundreds of years in the making, driven into being more by argument than by agreement. In the intellectual and religious ferment of the Greco-Roman world, various theologies and interpretations of the Gospel competed for credibility. The creeds were deemed necessary to codify the basic truths of this rapidly developing new religion. The Apostles\u2019 Creed, which is used principally at baptisms, answered the challenge of Gnosticism, which denied that Jesus was fully human. The Nicene Creed responded to the heresy of Aryanism, which denied that Jesus was fully divine. Jaroslav Pelikan was passionate when we spoke in his 80th year, often pounding the table in excitement as he made his point. So let\u2019s just start with some really basic questions. I mean, I have an M. Div. from Yale and, uh, and I remember being very surprised about thinking about creeds differently through that. But it\u2019s been a few years and I think some of the questions that came back to me that I think might on, you know, listeners\u2019 minds are, you know, do all traditions have creeds? All Christian traditions. Um, and how do they tend to be used? I mean, let\u2019s say, uh, as an Episcopalian, which I am now, they are part of the liturgy. But is that \u2014 is that how they are always used by different traditions? I don\u2019t think it is. And how are they meant to be used by ordinary people? So that\u2019s a big place to start. First of all, it is one of the differences between Christianity and the other major world religions, that Christianity has spawned many creeds as this set shows, thousands of\u2026 Right. Of pages of creeds. How many creeds have you collected? Well we collected nearly a thousand of them and cut it down to, I forget what the final box score is on that. Uh, somewhere around 200. Mm-hmm. See, whereas to be Jewish is to affirm every day, if you\u2019re observant, and with your dying breath, if you can, hero Israel, the Lord is our God. The Lord is one. The Shamah. And that\u2019s really all the creed that Israel needs. So it\u2019s been possible to be Jewish now for these 3000 or whatever years without publishing four volumes of creedal text. There is no God, but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet\u2026 Right. Muslim also\u2026 Is enough of a creed to uh, animate the most rapid expansion of a religion in the history of humanity from the death of the prophet in 632 to 732 in Gaal at the battle of Toor. Islam managed to spread from the Arabian Peninsula south and all the way across the northern coast of Africa to Gibraltar and into Spain and on into France in 100 years. OK. With this one little creed, and Christianity sprouts them at will right and left. So what is it about Christianity that has needed creeds? Well, what it is about religious faith that needs creed is that religious faith in general, prayer addressed \u201CTo Whom It May Concern,\u201D sentiment about some transcendent dimension otherwise undefined, does not have any staying power. It\u2019s OK to have that at 10:00 on a Sunday morning when you\u2019re out with your friends somewhere, but in the darkest hours of life, you\u2019ve got to believe something specific. And that specification is the task of the creed, because, much as some people may not like it, to believe one thing is also to disbelieve another. To say yes is also to say no. And clarifying what the yes is and then finding a way to say what it is we believe and the experimentation involved in that, I\u2019ve made a very good living studying the experimentation, trying \u2014 how they tried on particular words for size. There are words in the Bible, important words, which didn\u2019t get into the creeds. You see\u2026 Like what? I mean\u2026 Like the designation of Christ as logos. Logos means both \u201Cword\u201D and \u201Creason,\u201D as in logic. And the gospel of John begins with the words that many people know: \u201CIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\u201D And it was, in many ways, one of the most important terms in the arguments about the identity of Christ during the third and fourth centuries, and yet, in the only creed that all Christians or almost all Christians have in common, the so-called Nicene Creed, the term doesn\u2019t appear. And why was that? They wanted rather to make use of terms that would clarify simultaneously the distinction between God and His Son, that when I say I believe in Jesus Christ, I am not saying I believe in two gods. The doctrine of the Trinity was the effort to preserve monotheism. The real Unitarians were the Trinitarians. And for some in those arguments, the logos image seemed to truly present Christ as another entity\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026separate from God. As a subordinate and, therefore, in the nature of His being, different. But I think, let\u2019s say, for modern Christians, when you say that logos is Christ as reason and logic, that might be something appealing that was left out of the creeds that would help if it were in them. Well, sure. Of course, subsequently, the term logos is used very often in various creedal statements, statements that are intended to clarify, amplify, specify this or that out of the Nicene Creed. So it\u2019s not that the term was discarded, but that, in that particular creedal statement, it doesn\u2019t appear. There was just a passage in your manuscript where you said there\u2019s this question that\u2019s raised in the New Testament, which gets raised again and again. It\u2019s a question that Jesus asked: Who do you say\u2026 What think ye\u2026 \u2026that I am? Who do you say I am? Who do you say I am? Yeah. And that that question is asked again and again in every new tradition in every different culture. That actually is so simple but that really made sense to me, that that\u2019s an important question. And that\u2019s the difference between Jesus and Socrates. Say some more. I mean, all of us are, in one sense or another, pupils of Socrates. John Stewart Mill said humanity cannot be reminded often enough that there was once a man named Socrates, and that\u2019s right. But there are no temples built to Socrates. Nobody ever wrote the \u201CB Minor Mass\u201D in honor of Socrates, because he calls upon people to learn and therefore to be honest with themselves, but he does not call upon them to take up their cross and follow. And both he and Jesus died for what they believed. But Jesus died in the conscious commitment to the salvation of the world. And so wherever the message is preached and brought in whatever language it comes from, the language it comes to and the culture into which it penetrates must, at some stage of its maturation, learn to answer yet again the question: \u201CWho do you say that I am?\u201D Because the \u201Cyou say\u201D in that question is the culture in which we live. He\u2019s not asking, \u201CWho does the fourth century say that I am?\u201D when it was writing in Greek. That\u2019s important, because without that we wouldn\u2019t be where we are. But, at some point, you have to be who and what you are in the only culture in which you\u2019re ever going to live, the only century in which you\u2019re going to live and die, and, in that century, you have to answer with whatever linguistic and philosophical equipment you have, you have to answer the question: \u201CWho do you say that I am?\u201D I\u2019m basically a historian rather than a contemporary theologian. I usually say that everybody\u2019s an expert on his own century, and I file minority report on behalf of the preceding 19. And the history of the movement of Christianity from one place to another, of the translations of the Bible into now more than 2,000 languages is the history of how one sought, in a new setting, not to speak the same thing but to say the same thing. You spoke quite differently. And to test the integrity and, therefore, the honesty and, therefore, ultimately, the authenticity of what you\u2019re saying, that\u2019s the task of a creed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, the late historian Jaroslav Pelikan. He authored the definitive history of Christian doctrine, and his 2003 compilation of Christian creeds and confessions from across the globe was the first such effort since 1870. This, the Nicene Creed, is one of three ecumenical creeds and the only one accepted within Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity. It was drawn up at the first global meeting of the Christian church in 325, the Council of Nicea, though, it was only solidified 56 years later at the Council of Constantinople. The Nicene Creed is often sung or chanted. It begins, \u201CWe believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen. We do, let\u2019s say in this country at least and I don\u2019t know about in Africa, but in this country at least Christians of many churches do still often on Sunday morning or at least in \u2014 in their baptism, recite or have recited over them creeds that were written in the first few centuries of Christianity. Um, and I think, because they are recited and it\u2019s rote and they\u2019re memorized and yet modern people don\u2019t have any sense of why these fourth century creeds were written and the, as you say, the experimentation that was going on and the lively, passionate argument that was going on, they don\u2019t have as much meaning as they might. And so I\u2019d like to sort of get into that with you, um, partly because as you said, you file a minority report on behalf of the last 1900 years. I \u2014 I want to say that for the show we \u2014 we speak in the first person. You know, I ask people the\u2014 there\u2019s no abstraction about God. This is all with the integrity of a human life and a human mind behind it. But I think\u2026 Uh, but when I speak\u2026 When you speak in the first person, you \u2014 your friends, are you, CBS and Gregory Nazianzus? Because I speak in first person plural. Yes, you do. You do. And \u2014 and the original text of the creed was not, I believe. OK. We believe. Right. OK. So\u2026 Pistevo men was the Greek. Right. So there we are. Um, and so I thought maybe what would be fun would be to \u2014 to spend a moment with the Nicene Creed, which as you said is perhaps used by most\u2026 It is. It\u2019s the only universal creed. It is. OK. And why is that? Why the Nicene Creed and not any of the others in those early years or that came later? Well, there \u2014 you can answer that question on a number of levels. My father used to say the difference between a dialect and a language is that a language has an army. Uh, and \u2014 and a dialect is just spoken by people. And, so what we called the Nicene Creed, which is in fact adopted at the council of Constantinople in 381 rather than the council of Nicaea in 325. Yes. Where is Nicaea, by the way? I couldn\u2019t remember. It\u2019s in Turkey. OK. Iznik is its present, name, and of course, Constantinople of 381 is the present day Istanbul. Uh, but it was adopted at a council called and directed by the Christian emperor. Newly converted Christian emperor. The not-yet-baptized Christian emperor who was not baptized until his death and so all those years that he called himself, he \u2014 he said to the bishops of the church, \u201CAll of you are bishops and I too am a bishop. I am a bishop for the things outside the church and you are bishops for things inside the church.\u201D Oh, great. But by the time he was done, he was, uh, he was running things. Is that an early version of separation of church and state? Uh, not of separation, uh, it was actually, the term that was invented for it much later by scholars, was Caesural papism. That is that Caesar the emperor is \u2014 is in fact the pope. Wow. Uh, but, uh, so at one level, the reason for the, uh, universal authority of, uh, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is the political and military authority it carried and each conquest by the Roman Empire also brought the creed. Uh, Constantine\u2019s mother, St. Helen, came to Jerusalem and it was she who found the sepulcher of Christ and found the true cross and in the true cross were nails which she sent to Constantine and he had them melted down into a bit for his war horse. Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war. And as he marched and conquered, the creed came right with it. And so centuries later in the great modern expansion of Christianity, during the 18th and above all the 19th century, my late colleague Kevin Scott Areck at Yale, wrote a seven-volume history of the expansion of Christianity and three of the seven volumes are on the 19th century. Well, it\u2019s not accidental, that\u2019s also the great century of colonialism. Hmm. So the religion of the white man, which brought sanitation and, uh, money, economy and all the advantages and disadvantages of being modern, also brought the creeds. Well, this is making me think that we should be banning this from modern worship. Uh, and substituting another creed for it or no creed. It\u2019s a plausible suggestion and indeed, you are in the tradition of a fairly substantial group, particularly in the United States as we celebrate the 200th anniversary of, uh, one of the greatest thinkers America produced, Ralph Waldo Emerson, for whom I have great personal affection. My mother who was born in, Serbia, learned English partly reading Emerson. I still have her copies of Emerson from her girlhood. And, uh, Emerson was a graduate of Harvard Divinity school and was a Unitarian minister. So he was quite prepared to believe that everyone should compose a creed different from the tradition. He said to the divinity school students at Harvard in 1838, \u201CYou must be yourself a newborn bard of the Holy Spirit and \u2014 and sing it out.\u201D The trouble with that is, you do it and then you do it a little bit more and pretty soon you have to teach your children something and so the best you can do is to teach them what you have and do that a generation or two and all of a sudden, there you have\u2026 A new creed. A new creed. All right. Well\u2026 And the only alternative to tradition is bad tradition. Tell me what you value when you say the Nicene Creed? I know you know the Nicene Creed, not just in English, but in many languages. Partly because of what we\u2019ve already talked about, namely that I, I\u2019m very wrapped up in the whole history of the Church and particularly in the history of its teaching, so that, I cannot come at any question as though it had never been approached before. OK. Partly because of that, the singing of the creed is a very important and cherished way of indicating a universality of the faith across not only space, but time. To know that in the Philippines this morning this was the creed that was recited at mass and to know that the Emperor Justinian in the 6th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 13th, and my late father and grandfather all affirmed this. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s \u2018we\u2019 all of us together. And in a more profound sense, that also forms an answer to your \u2014 to your question. My faith and my faith life, like that of everyone else, fluctuates. There are ups and downs and hot spots and cold spots and boredom and ennui and all the rest can be there. And so I\u2019m not asked of a Sunday morning as of 9:20, what do you believe? And then you sit down with a 3\u00D75 index card and say, \u201CNow, let\u2019s see. What do I believe today?\u201D No, that\u2019s not what they\u2019re asking me. They\u2019re asking me, \u201CAre you a member of a community which now for millennium and a half has said, \u201CWe believe in one God.\u201D And so that\u2019s what I affirm when I sing it, and I suddenly \u2014 I know that the Bach B Minor mass is the great setting of this. My late friend, Steven J. Gould, uh, who insisted with dogmatic fervor that he wasn\u2019t a believer, was a member, uh, in addition to being a distinguished paleontologist and a terrific communicator, uh, Steve Gould was a member of the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston. And so he sang all this ancient music. And in an interview several years ago that we were both involved in, he was asked about communication with other planets and other worlds, and how should we try to reach people who don\u2019t know our language or anything else. And he said, \u2018We should play the Bach \u201CB Minor Mass\u201D and say, in as many languages as we can, \u201CThis is the best we have ever done, and we would like you to hear it, and we\u2019d like to hear the best you have ever done.\u201D\u2018 And so he would want broadcast systems blaring across our solar system and beyond it with the \u201CB Minor Mass,\u201D including \u201CCredo in unum Deum.\u201D Right. And that for you is the setting of this great creed of the church. You can listen again and share this conversation with Jaroslav Pelikan through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, The Need for Creeds, with the late, great religious historian Jaroslav Pelikan. He illuminated religious tradition in order to enliven faith in the present and future. Jaroslav Pelikan produced the 20th century\u2019s most authoritative research on the history and meaning of Christian tradition. Then, before his death in 2006, in his 80th year, Pelikan also published Credo, a four-volume collection of Christian creeds from biblical times to the present and from around the world. You know, I spoke with a scientist, a geneticist who\u2019s also an Anglican priest at one point, and he said that with his mentality of a scientist, like Steven J. Gould, he, uh, he thinks of the creeds \u2014 the great creeds of the church as sort of the best working hypothesis we have. Which is sort of liberating for me because it \u2014 at \u2014 on the one hand, it doesn\u2019t mean that we throw them out the window, right? You keep working with them and you also realize that you\u2019re grappling with mystery. St. Augustine, who wrote probably the most important book about the Holy Trinity ever written, an enormous work in abstract Latin exploring if we are created in the image of God and God is Trinity, then how is the human soul a Trinity, and then looking at all kinds of biblical passages and all that. And at the end of this enormous work, on which he spent so many years, he said, \u201CWe have said this not in order to say something, but in order not to remain altogether silent,\u201D and that\u2019s right. And I\u2019m sure that a scientist feels that way, and, you know, in a sense, I\u2019m a scientist. I work in historical science. So, for me, as a scholar would say \u2014 that\u2019s the more appropriate term now \u2014 the historical conditionedness of all of this, that each of these words has centuries of development behind it, that there was a time when people believed in a universe that had three floors and, therefore, Christ can descend into hell and ascend into heaven as though it were a lift in a small building with three levels, and that we can\u2019t believe that anymore, etc. All of that is in there, and I can\u2019t wipe it out, perform a frontal lobotomy, as though it weren\u2019t true. But because you have to say something, we cannot but speak of those things which we have seen and heard, the apostles say in the book of Acts, because you have to say something. And because what you say is what you have received as it then passes through you, not around you, I say what I say in the creed, and it also performs the function of a flag. How\u2019s that? An identity by which we are known to those who may not be part of this community, but who want to know what you are. You wear a flag in your lapel or you fly a flag from your sailboat or whatever. There is a mark of identity. And that is one of the difficult sticking points for modern people living in an increasingly pluralistic world. Right? And you talk about this a great deal in your manuscript. You\u2019re very much aware of the modern discomfort. Sure. The discomfort of the modern consciousness with the whole notion of creed. Yeah, I\u2019m aware of it. I don\u2019t share it. Yeah. But I\u2019m \u2014 yes, I\u2019m a professor in a secular university, and as the saying goes, and some of my best friends have nothing to do with creeds. The interesting thing, though, is the world is much more pluralistic than it is relativistic, and those are often equated in the secular West. Because there are so many different beliefs, therefore, the best thing is not to have any beliefs. But all those other beliefs are very firm, as we\u2019re discovering, now that suddenly we\u2019re conscious that there are a billion Muslims in the world. And the need to have understanding and toleration and to guarantee religious liberty are often grounded by people on relativism. Because you can\u2019t really know anything for sure, therefore, you must not constrain others to believe, which is basically what Thomas Jefferson said. Right. Well, also, I think there\u2019s a sort of impulse \u2014 it\u2019s not always articulated \u2014 that if you proclaim a truth, that, in some way, you are negating the truth of another. People feel that way. Americans feel that way. As I say, because they came to their understanding of religious toleration by way of a conviction that religious beliefs are relative. If we\u2019re going to have to wait for one billion Muslims to become relativists\u2026 To live in our kind of pluralism? Yeah, if that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get religious understanding, then we better fasten our safety belts. The most important systematic formulation of Jewish theology, A Guide to the Perplexed by Rabbi Moses Maimonides, Rambam, was written under the protection of a Muslim ruler and written in Arabic. And the most important statement of Eastern Orthodox Christianity ever written was entitled \u201COn the Orthodox Faith\u201D by John of Damascus, protected by the sultan of Damascus. So that here, in a Muslim-ruled culture, both of these scholars for the other two great monotheisms of the Book\u2026 Made profound statements of their faith. That\u2019s right. And it\u2019s hard to believe that that would have happened in modern Baghdad. No, but that\u2019s where your communion with history and bringing those pieces of information into our modern consciousness is important. Yeah, that\u2019s the first \u2014 and we have to have the \u2014 and so it must be possible \u2014 let\u2019s say within the framework of Islam \u2014 it must be possible to affirm the faith of Islam \u2014\u201DThere\u2019s one God, and Mohammed is His prophet\u201D \u2014 as a faith by which you would be willing to live and die, to affirm that and at the same time \u2014 not nevertheless, but therefore \u2014 to say that those who do not share this faith have the right to affirm their faith, partly because there is only one God and anybody who believes in God believes in that God, and there are not several gods lined up as \u2014 as alternatives. And I can hear that as a very pertinent challenge to, say, Christians in America. Well, sure, many of whom don\u2019t believe much of anything. You see, but the Second Vatican Council \u2014 this remarkable event of the 20th century, certainly the most important religious event of the 20th century, maybe the most important event since the Reformation \u2014 at the Second Vatican Council, the declaration on religious liberty, largely written by my late friend Father John Courtney Murray of the Society of Jesus, declared the right of religious liberty not on the basis of saying, \u2018Well, doesn\u2019t matter much what you believe,\u2019 quite the opposite. Because you believe in the Christian tradition, which affirms creation of the human race in the image of God \u2014 the title of the declaration is \u201CDignitatis Humanae,\u201D \u201CHuman Dignity\u201D \u2014 because of that, because therefore, religious faith is so important rather than because it\u2019s so trivial, therefore, you must not constrain others, because faith can only be given freely. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, on the need for creeds with the late, great historian Jaroslav Pelikan. So we\u2019ve named this modern problem with creeds and some of the problems with the way we\u2019ve addressed that. But there is this tension between the creeds. And as you point out, I mean, even the oldest creeds we have did not come out of the mouth of Jesus Christ, right? The only creed that came out of His mouth was the creed of Judaism. Right. OK. The Shema. And that\u2019s good for us to remember too. Yes. And, uh, so there are good religious impulses that say it\u2019s not so important to \u2014 to recite words what \u2014 you know, there\u2019s this tension between having the creeds and on the one hand experiencing personal revelation and being in prayer and \u2014 and having your own religious life. On the other hand, saying what\u2019s important is acting, you know, What would Jesus do? is the \u2014 the bumper sticker. But, uh\u2026 Well, for one thing he would\u2026 some of that\u2026 For one thing, he wouldn\u2019t have a bumper sticker. He wouldn\u2019t have a bumper sticker. But but I think some of that kind of \u2014 I think the impulse to say yes, we have creeds, but that\u2019s not enough, that is also part of this modern\u2026 It\u2019s necessary, but not sufficient. Rejection. Yes. Yeah, I \u2014 every Sunday at worship, I\u2019m a member of the Orthodox Church in America, in the liturgy of St. John Chrysostam, which goes back to the 4th century, the chant is \u201CLet us love one another that with one mind we may confess the Holy Trinity one in essence and undivided. Let us love one another\u2026 Hmm. That we may confess. That we may confess.\u201D Right. Nobody says that it is the nature of God to be a creed and the New Testament says it is the nature of God to be love. And so to get the priorities straight\u2026 Right. Even just as you\u2019re about to recite the creed yet again, let us love one another. But, if we love one another, then, uh, for one thing, we shouldn\u2019t tell each other lies. We should tell each other the truth as God has given it to us to see the truth. And if you don\u2019t want to tell a lie, tell the truth as the Church has perceived and learned the truth, then you end up with something that has a distinct family resemblance to the Creed. OK. Because we love one another, and love our children and love the generations yet unborn, we want to pass onto them what we have been blessed with, which is, among other things, the Creed. And the creed is, of course, primarily in the setting of prayer and worship. It\u2019s a liturgical, uh, affirmation, more often chanted than spoken. Mm-hmm. Uh, it\u2019s \u2014 a creed is spoken at baptism, but most of the rest of the time, in most of the traditions, it is sung and, uh, that says something too because there are things we can sing that we have a hard time saying. And the language of love, which is, in our human experience, a curious combination of spontaneity and, uh, convention. There \u2014 there just aren\u2019t terribly many ways to say I love you besides saying I love you. Uh, we\u2019re recording this in the state of Minnesota in which the old story is of the Norwegian who loved his wife so much he almost told her. And so in one sense it\u2019s a very rote thing to do to say I love you. You are the one I love. There is no one else I love. But there aren\u2019t very many permutations. Right. And on the other hands, it\u2019s the language of love is spontaneous. You can\u2019t repress it. When it comes time to say it, darn it, you say it and take the consequences \u2014 and that\u2019s how it is, how God\u2019s love is expressed both spontaneously by God and conventionally by God. God also says I love you and in a very conventional way and in turn, our love to God, which is always a response to a love that started with Him and ends in Him. Our response to that love is the service of one another and of humanity, but also an act of adoration. This setting of the St. John Chrysostom text that Jaroslav Pelikan mentioned is by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninov. This is giving me a lovely and exalted way to think about a remark you make in your book, that one thing that someone who studies all these creeds, as you\u2019ve done, is struck by is the sheer repetitiveness of them. Right? You should try to proofread them all in the course of a few weeks, as we did, and then you discover just how \u2014 you wonder, didn\u2019t I read this one yesterday? No, and it \u2014 but it\u2019s so interesting, because I think that where someone goes when they hear that there are these thousands of creeds is that everybody\u2019s doing it differently all the time, and that\u2019s not really what you find. But I did want to dwell briefly on one that I sense is near and dear to your heart, which is this Maasai Creed\u2026 Oh, yes. \u2026the Maasai people of Africa, which was written around 1960, the Congregation of the Holy Ghost in east Nigeria. I don\u2019t know. Would you like to read some of your favorite\u2026 Like most creeds, it is designed on a threefold pattern of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and comes out of the experience of Christians in Africa who were animists, fetishists who worshiped things in nature and the mystery of life and who then, upon receiving the Christian faith, began reciting the creeds as they had been taught, in this case by Roman Catholic missionaries, in other cases by Evangelical or Orthodox missionaries. But after a couple of generations of that, a Christian community gradually comes of age, achieves a level of maturation where you want to do it for yourself, do it your way, speaking in your context, using the images of your culture. And the question is can you do that without sacrificing the integrity of what you have received? It\u2019s easy just to repeat, but then it\u2019s not your own. It\u2019s easy to say what is your own as though nobody had ever said it before, but then the question is whether it\u2019s authentically Christian. And I think this one manages to do both of those in a remarkable way. \u201CWe believe in one high God, who out of love created the beautiful world. We believe that God made good His promise by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, a man in the flesh, a Jew by tribe, born poor in a little village, who left His home and was always on safari doing good, curing people by the power of God, teaching about God and man, and showing that the meaning of religion is love. He was rejected by His people, tortured and nailed, hands and feet to a cross, and died. He lay buried in the grave, but the hyenas did not touch Him, and on the third day He rose from the grave.\u201D Now for one thing, the Nicene Creed as well as the Apostles\u2019 Creed go directly from born of the Virgin Mary to suffered under Pontius Pilate. And the whole story in the Gospels\u2026 The life of Christ. \u2026yeah, is just leapt over. And that\u2019s what a lot of modern people have criticized in the creeds. You go from Alpha to Omega. And here, see, He was born, as the creed said, He left His home \u2014 the creeds don\u2019t say that \u2014 and He was always on safari in Africa. When I read that the first time, a student of mine who\u2019d been a member of a religious order, she was a sister, and she had been in a hospital in east Nigeria, and that\u2019s the creed they recited at their liturgy. And so she brought it to me, and I just got shivers, just the thought, you know, the hyenas did not touch Him and the act of defiance \u2014 God lives even in spite of the hyenas. But it\u2019s a good example of this model that I quoted earlier, that it is not enough to Christianize Africa. We have to Africanize Christianity. No, the dangers in there are enormous. Mm-hmm. In the 1930s, under the Nazis, a movement that wanted to purify Germany of foreign \u2014 that is to say Jewish \u2014 influences and to affirm Aryanism \u2014 that is to say, we do not want to Christianize Germany, we want to Germanize Christianity \u2014 taking the same model, and they ended up\u2026 \u2026completely destroying\u2026 \u2026denying that Jesus was Jewish, refusing to ordain as priest or minister anyone who had one-fourth Jewish blood. And so intuitively, one knows that this Maasai creed has the ring of authenticity and that that Nazi creed does not. Yes. But specifying that, explaining what is the real difference between this kind of \u2014 as they use the technical word \u2014 acculturation and that kind, is not easy. And by the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ve got to be talking about the nature of creeds. OK. Oh, it\u2019s very exciting though. It\u2019s very exciting. So you are one of the great, religious historians, uh, I believe theological minds of our time and I can\u2019t not ask you about your conversion. In 1998 you converted from Lutheran tradition in which you had grown up to Eastern Orthodoxy. And I just wondered, I\u2019m sure we could talk about that for hours. I could but I won\u2019t. You could but you won\u2019t. But I wonder, just given what we\u2019ve been talking about, about the Creeds, how does your reverence for and your knowledge of this kind of Christian expression, you know, how is that part of your reasons for this conversion? The centrality of tradition as a force, as the bearer of the message, as what the Church believes even if I don\u2019t believe anything at a particular moment and it \u2014 the capacity of tradition to sustain itself and to sustain the church is something with which I have been impressed, partly through my own studies and partly by my faith. And then realization that the, of course, there was tradition before there was a bible. Right. That the bible came out of tradition and\u2026 Mm-hmm. Took a couple of hundred years to pull together. Then tradition went on interpreting the bible\u2026 Yes. After the last book of the bible had been written, and a deep awareness and I suppose a deepening awareness historically of not only change, but of continuity. I have never seen it in print that every day since the middle of the first century, Christians have gathered together around bread and wine, thanked God and received it as the body and blood of Christ. That there has been no day when that didn\u2019t happen. The doctrines about it have changed. The liturgical forms have changed. All of that but that, this has happened, every day, what, you multiply 2000 by 365 with an extra day for leap years, that\u2019s a massive continuity. And creeds represent that, and, uh, Moliere\u2019s The Bourgeois Gentilhomme, he discovered one day that he had been speaking prose all his life. And so I sort of discovered that I\u2019ve been speaking Orthodox all my life. OK. And so I didn\u2019t really convert. Convert is to change and I didn\u2019t change. I simply discovered the continuity that had been there all along. Well, isn\u2019t that what change is often about? I don\u2019t know. I \u2014 well, I suppose. Jaroslav Pelikan died on May 13, 2006.
