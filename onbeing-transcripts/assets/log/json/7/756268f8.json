  "fullText": "Being human is about being in the right kind of relationships. I think being human is a process. It\u2019s not something that we just are born with. We actually learn to celebrate our connection, learn to celebrate our love. If you suffer, it does not imply love. But if you love, it does imply suffering. To suffer with, though, compassion, not to suffer against. And if we can hold that space big enough, we also have joy and fun even as we suffer. And suffering will no longer divide us. And to me, that\u2019s sort of the human journey. We\u2019re not defined by the worst that happens but we struggle to know how to rise to our best; so what if we opened the question of race to the question of belonging? john powell counsels all kinds of people and projects on the front lines of our current racial longings. He reminds us that race is relational. It\u2019s as much about whiteness as about color. And it largely plays out, as we\u2019re learning through new science, in our unconscious minds. john powell is steeped in this new learning and he offers it to us as a form of everyday power \u2014 to animate our connection to others that is already real. But we must claim it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. john a. powell is a legal scholar and director of the Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society at the University of California at Berkeley. He\u2019s previously taught in Africa and across the United States. I spoke with him in front of a live audience at the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. Where I\u2019d like to start I think is \u2014 here are some things you\u2019ve said about race: \u201CRace is a little bit like gravity. Race is not just an external trait, it is also an internal process that can create and destroy internal and external worlds.\u201D I would like to start, though, with just posing that question to you, the question of what race is and how you would begin to answer that question through the story of your earliest life. And your answer might include the spiritual aspect of that as well as the practical. Well, first of all, good morning, and thank you for having me. Like most of our lives, we have many stories. And sometimes we wonder if they\u2019re true. Even though we live them because we keep making stories, we keep adding to our stories. I come from a large family. And my father and mother were sharecroppers in the South. My father\u2019s a Christian minister. He\u2019s celebrating 95 this year. He really is an amazing person, as is my mom. And if I were to chronicle their lives, it would sound like, wow, what a hard life, having lost his mother at a very early age. He was forced to leave school in the third grade to start working full-time and worked ever since then. He\u2019d lost limbs. He\u2019s legally blind. I remember being 12 years old in Detroit. He, like most people from the South, he did everything himself. So, he\u2019s fixing the furnace, and it blew up. It cindered all the hair on his body, so he had burns all over his body. We\u2019re driving around the city trying to find a hospital who would accept a black man and getting turned away, and then going on to the next hospital, getting turned away. And as I tell these stories, again, they are sad stories. But when you meet my dad, he just radiates love. I mean, he literally attracts people. And he has this quality of appreciating life, and I feel like a little of that has fallen to me. My interest in social justice \u2014 I don\u2019t know where it comes from, really, except I would say part of it\u2019s the family. Part of it\u2019s \u2014 to me, it\u2019s an expression of caring, just caring about people and saying that you are connected to people in other life forms and then giving it voice. And I think if we do that, we not only lean into what\u2019s called social justice, but deeply into spirituality and religion as well. This moment we\u2019re in now, writ large \u2014 one of the things you said is that race is in the DNA of this country. But it\u2019s also ever changing and evolving, and that right now, in our neighborhoods and our world, there are contradictory things happening. So kind of on a \u2014 with a wide lens, talk about the contradictory things you see happening. Well, race is actually \u2014 it is like gravity. And I like to use that metaphor because what scientists say is like all of us have weight, right? And so we think we may all be experts in gravity. But scientists say there are probably twelve people in the world that really understand gravity. And I would say there\u2019s only a few more in the world that understand race. But it\u2019s actually incredibly complex once we start peeling it back. I\u2019m old enough to have been born colored. And then I became a negro. And then I became black. And then I became African-American. And then I became afro. And people are just now confused, like, so what are we? You know?And part of the confusion \u2014 and each of those terms are significant. But also, race is deeply relational. And it\u2019s interesting if you go back and think about how whiteness was early defined in America. It was defined largely as not black. And so, James Baldwin reminds us that blackness is in whiteness, that whiteness is in blackness, that these are these complicated dances, these \u2014 that we \u2014 most of us don\u2019t understand. Yeah. And I fantasize about having entire discussions where we didn\u2019t use the word \u201Crace,\u201D where we were talking about all the things that are actually involved. And I think one reason I feel it doesn\u2019t work as shorthand \u2014 like a lot of words we need. Like \u201Clove\u201D is another one we\u2019ve probably \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019ve ruined it. But we tend to take the word \u201Crace\u201D in our imaginations to be something that is about people of color. And a point that\u2019s so important in your writing is the question of whiteness. Right? That we all have race. Right. And you actually gave me \u2014 you know, the language of white privilege \u2014 an analogy that you gave that was so helpful to me \u2014 you said, \u201CWhiteness is like the invisible presence of the narrator in a story told from the third person point of view.\u201D That\u2019s very helpful\u2026 Yeah. \u2026for me to imagine that. Yeah. So one of the things about language is language \u2014 it\u2019s never quite right, but neither is not language. And what we\u2019re finding now in the last 30 years is that much of the work, in terms of our cognitive and emotional response to the world, happens at the unconscious level. We move from race, the discussion of race \u2014 it was partially because we were trying to move from the Jim Crow era and the white supremacy era. And we said, \u201COK, that\u2019s bad.\u201D So to notice race is bad, so let\u2019s not notice it anymore. Yeah. But it was still deeply embedded in our biology, in our structures, in our arrangements. And the unconscious was saying to the conscious, \u201CYou can do whatever you want to. We\u2019re going to keep noticing race.\u201D And so it\u2019s keep \u2014 still responds to race in some pretty powerful ways. The other thing is that because we are so powerfully rooted to the notion of individuality, and some way, race affronts that. But the real affront is the whole notion of individuality. Individuality, as we think of it, is actually extremely problematic. Well, see \u2014 yeah. And you make this really fascinating point that \u2014 you say that there are two parents to the way we are now, the way we grapple with race among other things. And one is slavery \u2014 get that. And the other is the Enlightenment. And that, in fact, it\u2019s from the Enlightenment that we inherited this idea that the conscious mind could know everything, that we could be reasonable. Yeah, that\u2019s the American exceptionalism. And so the United States became extremely, extremely attached to the notion of individuality and independence. Now think about the groups who were not independent. They were the Africans, they were the Indians, they were women, they were anyone who was not a white male. Right. So the notion, the Enlightenment Project which had this hubris that we could control everything, including the world, when we can\u2019t even really control ourselves. Right. And if we were having this discussion in 1980, we\u2019d say, \u201COK. Let\u2019s not do race. Let\u2019s look at everyone as an individual. Why do we have all these categories?\u201D Well, now if you ask the question, why do we have all those categories, the science will tell us\u2014that\u2019s the way the mind works. The mind actually works with categories. We simply cannot process the world, we simply would not exist as a species without categories. And yet this condition of each of us in isolation, which you associate with whiteness, which is this cultural of domination, is not sustainable. And it\u2019s not desirable. It is not. And we\u2019re running into the \u2014 and I feel like we\u2019ve run \u2014 we\u2019re running into the limits of our ability to convince ourselves that it is desirable. No, there are so many expressions that help us see it. And sometimes people talk about \u2014 we need to do things to connect. And on one hand that\u2019s right, but the other hand, it understates what it is. We are connected. What we need to do is become aware of it, to live it, to express it. Right. So think about segregation. Segregation is a formal way of saying, \u201CHow do I deny my connection with you in the physical space?\u201D Think about the notion of whiteness. So, whiteness, in the United States, as it came, as it took form, believed that one drop of black blood, whatever that is, would destroy whiteness. Turns out, whatever that means, most white Americans actually do have black blood. The reason that most African-Americans look like me or like Gary is because white blood and black blood\u2019s been mixing up for a long time. And so I think that as we deny the other, we deny ourselves. Because there is no other. We are connected. How do we actually acknowledge that? How do we actually celebrate that? I think one of things we have to do is have a different sense of whiteness. Because whiteness is the hard nut\u2026 Right. \u2026that wants to exclude, that wants to dominate, that wants \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean people who are phenotypically light skinned. I mean the practice\u2026 This culture. \u2026of whiteness. Right. Yeah. Two years ago, I was \u2014 I had this great privilege \u2014 actually, a few of us on our team \u2014 to go to the civil rights pilgrimage\u2014and so we\u2019re right at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, King\u2019s church. There was a white journalist there. And he had been one of the main journalists who covered the Civil Rights Movement, I think for the New York Times, but anyway \u2014 one of the major papers. He told this story about sitting with Dr. King. And this man, though, as \u2014 this journalist had gone back and looked at his own family as part of his investigation of that and found all of this slavery and slaveholding. And he had this realization that he shared with us. He had this moment, this aha moment, after covering this movement as a journalist, that that movement was as much for the sake of his soul as it was for the sake of people of color. And it\u2019s worth saying that. I mean, and to me, that\u2019s one way of talking about your point that we have to talk about whiteness. Well you\u2019re exactly right. I was teaching a class at the University of Minnesota, and I was talking about the taking of Native American land. And most of my students were white students, and one student objected. It was like, \u201CThis is a such-and-such class. Why are we studying the history of Native Americans?\u201D And I said, \u201CWe\u2019re not. We\u2019re studying the history of America.\u201D So when we talk about the appropriation of Native American land or when we talk about slavery, we\u2019re not talking about the history of black people, we\u2019re talking about the history of this country. And Toni Morrison made the observation. She said we\u2019ve had all of these studies on what the institution of slavery has done to mark the black identity. She says it\u2019s about time we look at what it\u2019s done to mark the white identity. It\u2019s America. That\u2019s what slavery is about. It\u2019s about America. And I don\u2019t care if you came here last week or ten days ago, you can\u2019t understand this country without understanding the institution of slavery. It was pivotal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, opening up the race narrative with esteemed thinker and legal scholar john a powell. We\u2019re with a live audience at the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. There\u2019s language that you\u2019ve been using, that I really appreciate, of belonging. As we try to move beyond the language that\u2019s divided us and the behavior that\u2019s divided us, tell me how you came to that and what that means for you and how you think that might be powerful. The human condition is one about belonging. We simply cannot thrive unless we are in relationship. I just gave a lecture on health. And if you\u2019re isolated, the negative health condition is worse than smoking, obesity, high blood pressure \u2014 just being isolated. Right. So we need to be in relationship with each other. And so, when you look at what groups are doing, whether they are disability groups or whether they\u2019re groups organized around race, they are really trying to make us \u2014 a claim of, \u201CI belong. I\u2019m a member.\u201D So if you think about Black Lives Matter, it\u2019s really just saying, \u201CWe belong.\u201D How we define the other affects how we define ourselves. Right. And so when we define the other at extreme, it means we have to cut off large parts of our self. One other example, which I just love this \u2014 I mean, \u201Clove it\u201D is the wrong word \u2014 but there was a headline in a newspaper several years ago saying, \u201CWe\u2019re entering a state where, for the first time in over 350 years, the world will be led by a non-Christian, non-white country.\u201D And what it was saying is we should be afraid. So the early debates around integrating schools \u2014 the white segregationists were: \u201CWe can\u2019t have integrated schools because black and white children might get to know each other and might marry each other and have babies.\u201D The Civil Rights Movement\u2019s was: \u201CThis is not about marriage.\u201D The white segregationists were right. You bring people together, they will actually learn to love each other. Some of them will marry and have children. And so it will actually change the fabric of society. When people worry that having gays in our community will change what marriage really means, actually, they\u2019re right. When people worry that having a lot of Latinos in the United States would change United States, they are right. We\u2019re constantly making each other. And so we can\u2019t hold onto a notion that this is what America is, so Latinos don\u2019t affect us. So part of it is that our fear that we are holding onto something, and the other is going to change it. And the other is going to change it, but we\u2019re going to change the other. And we\u2019re going to \u2014 if we do it right, we\u2019re going to create a bigger \u201Cwe,\u201D a different \u201Cwe.\u201D And there\u2019s no way we can approach that challenge, as you just described it, which is a human challenge, with laws or policies or school reform alone. But let\u2019s just say it this way \u2014 it\u2019s a way of us taking up the language of the beloved community, which was the language, which was the goal of Dr. King and John Lewis and all those people. And you use that language too. That\u2019s right. I mean, we\u2019ve learned some things since then. I mean, one time, we talked about integration, and we equated integration with assimilation. Arthur Schlesinger talked about that in some of his work. That was clearly wrong. We\u2019re not going to all melt into each other. And yet, we do have to have a beloved community, not in a small sense, but in the large sense. And I would even extend it beyond people, to have a beloved relationship with the planet. And to live that, and to have structures that reflect that\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is a very different way of ordering society. And then I think we can also learn to relax. Then we don\u2019t have to be afraid of the force. Yes, it will take us beyond what we\u2019re comfortable with, who we are right now. But I think we need help in getting there. And right now, we don\u2019t have the language for that because we still have the language of the Enlightenment Project. We still have the language of, \u201CYou can be anything you want to be, you can control, you\u2019re in charge of your own destiny.\u201D Even the notion of sovereignty is very problematic. That whether it\u2019s a community or a nation, there\u2019s no such thing as sovereignty. We are in relationship with each other. It can be a bad relationship or a good relationship, but we are in relationship with each other. OK. So, I think what\u2019s also relaxing about what you just said about belonging and reframing our relationship with the other is \u2014 one thing that becomes overpowering when we talk about race or \u2014 yeah \u2014 is we tend to talk about clusters of issues. And whether it\u2019s income inequality or schools or crime and incarceration or segregated neighborhoods and, even on a global scale, it even gets into these issues of scarcity, scarcity of natural resources. So all of those things are problems. They are big issues. But when you start lumping them all together as what we have to tackle, it\u2019s completely overwhelming and paralyzing. It\u2019s not that the project of belonging is simple\u2026 No, it\u2019s not. \u2026but somehow, I feel that it might open our imaginations in a new way, which also might open possibilities for action. Well, I think that\u2019s right. One reason the problems seem overwhelming is because we\u2019re using the wrong tools to understand them and fix them. We\u2019re actually talking about a profound change in paradigm. And so right now we\u2019re still thinking about \u2014 it\u2019s like trying to think about computers as fancy typewriters. So if you\u2019re using the framework of typewriters to try to make sense of computers, it\u2019s very clumsy. It doesn\u2019t work. You have to really shift it all together. Or you think about automobiles. Automobiles was initially thought of as a\u2026 Horseless carriage. \u2026horseless carriage, right? Right. So the whole way of understanding cars was like a carriage. A horse \u2014 so the metaphors break down, and they don\u2019t work. And so, right now, we\u2019re trying to use \u2014 I would say that the language of individuality, the language of the Enlightenment to understand something that goes into a different area. And it makes it incredibly complicated. Actually, I think that because everything is connected \u2014 I say this to my students sometimes. If you want to affect all of the people in San Francisco with the measles, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to go around to each person one at a time. Just go to BART, which is our subway, on a crowded day, expose it, it\u2019s done. Because people are in relationships, they will do the rest of the work for you. So because we\u2019re in systems, if we can figure out where are the \u2014 what\u2019s called the inflection point in systems, it populates the whole system. So how can we make belonging infectious? Is that\u2026 \u2026how do we make it infectious? How do we \u2014 people are longing for this. People are looking for community. Right now, though, we don\u2019t have confidence in love. You mentioned love earlier. We have much more confidence in anger and hate. We believe anger is powerful. We believe hate is powerful. And we believe love is wimpy. And so if we\u2019re engaged in the world, we believe it\u2019s much better to sort of organize around anger and hate. And yet, we see two of the most powerful expressions, certainly Gandhi, certainly the Reverend Dr. King \u2014 and I always remind people he was a reverend. It wasn\u2019t just Dr. King. Even though he came out of a violent revolution \u2014 Nelson Mandela \u2014 he just \u2014 again, I met him personally \u2014 he just exuded love. And as you know, he had a chance to leave prison early. He refused to unless it included structuring the country. He actually tried to actually lean into a notion of beloved community. He actually didn\u2019t want the blacks to control or dominate the whites. He wanted to create \u2014 so his aspiration \u2014 and he\u2019s loved. Even today, he\u2019s loved in South Africa, and he\u2019s loved around the world. So I think part of it is that we don\u2019t have to imagine doing things one at a time. And the other thing is that it\u2019s not that we necessarily get there, but we claim life, our own and others. We actually celebrate and engage in life. And so, to me, it\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s not like, \u201CHow do we get there?\u201D It\u2019s like, \u201CHow do we live?\u201D Yeah. And there was a period of time when I was feeling really overwhelmed with a lot of this stuff. And I was talking to my dad, and I said, \u201CDad, this is just too much. I can\u2019t do it all. I\u2019m trying to do all of this stuff by myself.\u201D And he looked at me and said, \u201CJohn, you know you\u2019re not alone.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat do you mean, Dad?\u201D He said, \u201CWell, you got God with you.\u201D And I realized, although I don\u2019t organize around God the way he does, my mistake was I thought I had to do it, that I was defining it instead of \u201Cwe.\u201D So\u2026 \u2026you were in that white mode. Exactly, exactly. So I think we should both get out of the white mode and do it together. Yeah. So I\u2019m looking in your work, and you\u2019re giving these pointers, but \u2014 so here\u2019s something you wrote: \u201CIf you look at 1950s attitudes towards integration versus today, the majority of whites today say they\u2019d prefer to live in an integrated neighborhood and send their kids to integrated schools. What they mean by that is a different question, but also the world and demographics of the country are changing. And to live in a white enclave is not to live in the world. And I think it has\u201D \u2014 I think you were \u2014 this is an interview \u2014 \u201Cit has a certain deadness to it. It has a certain spiritual corruption to it.\u201D And you said, \u201CI think most people, white, black, Latino, and otherwise, would like to see something different. We just don\u2019t know how to do it. And we\u2019ve been so entrenched in the way things are. It\u2019s hard to imagine the world being different.\u201D You speak for me, you speak for so many people. This is what we\u2019re up against. I feel like this is what we have to attack first, this inability to see differently. You told one story about Oak Park near Chicago. It was just really helpful to me. You said when we tell stories about \u2014 you integrate neighborhoods, and housing values go down. And the way we always tell the story is blacks moved in, African-American, people of color moved in. And the way we could tell the story is whites moved out. But you talked about how just this very practical measure that was taken so that the housing values didn\u2019t change \u2014 would you just tell that story? I feel like these little stories are really crucial as well. And there are really a lot of them. They\u2019re little, and they\u2019re big. So Oak Park is in Chicago. Chicago\u2019s one of the most segregated areas in the country. Cook County has the largest black population of any county in the United States, and a lot of studying of segregation takes place in Chicago. So here you have Oak Park, this precious little community. And they were liberal whites there, and blacks started moving in. And they were saying, \u201CLook, we actually don\u2019t mind blacks moving in, but we\u2019re concerned that we\u2019re going to lose the value of our home. That\u2019s the only wealth we have. And if we don\u2019t sell now, we\u2019re going to lose.\u201D And it basically said, \u201CIf that\u2019s the real concern, not that blacks are moving in, that you\u2019re going to lose the value of your home, what if we were to ensure that you would not lose the value of your home? We\u2019ll literally create an insurance policy that the value of your home \u2014 we will compensate you if the value of your home goes down.\u201D And they put that in place. And \u201Cwe\u201D was what? The local government? Yeah. Yeah. And they haven\u2019t had to pay one policy. Whites didn\u2019t run to the suburbs, further out to the suburbs. And that\u2019s a stable community. It\u2019s been that way for 50 years. So part of it is \u2014 and this is sort of interesting on a number of levels because you could say those white people were just being racist. They were just using the insurance policy as an excuse. Maybe, maybe not. So are you willing to actually take them at their word? Are you willing to embrace them and engage them where they are? Because people do have anxieties, and they\u2019re multiple. But I want to give two other examples very quickly. Think about Katrina. So these examples are all around us, and yet, we don\u2019t tell stories about them. Katrina \u2014 the face of Katrina, when you remember it, it was blacks stuck on roofs as the water was rising. What\u2019s not told is that Americans, all Americans, gave to those people. It was the largest civilian giving of one population to another in the history of the United States. So here you had white Americans, Latino-Americans, Asian-Americans trying to reach out to what they saw as black Americans. They were actually saying \u2014 they were claiming we have a shared humanity. And they actually did a poll asking people if they were willing to raise taxes to rebuild. 70 percent of Americans said, \u201CYes, we would tax ourselves to help those people.\u201D The pundits and the politicians ignored it. And so that story simply didn\u2019t get told. The fastest growing demographic in the United States, the fastest growing demographic in United States is not Latinos. It\u2019s actually interracial couples and interethnic couples. That\u2019s people themselves right now, not tomorrow, trying to imagine a different America, trying to say, \u201CI can love anyone. I can be with anyone.\u201D So I think we start looking for it, we see expressions all around it. Oftentimes, they\u2019re not celebrated. They\u2019re not talked about. There are no structures for them. So we have to embrace them and lift them up. Yeah. But there\u2019s reason to be hopeful. And talk about a movement that is going to change the DNA of race, right? Richard Rodriguez talks about the \u201Cbrowning\u201D of America. Yes. You can listen again and share this conversation with john powell through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, opening to the question of belonging, with john a. powell. He is a wise, redemptive thinker on the front lines of racial longings. I spoke with him before a live audience at the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. Let\u2019s invite you into the conversation. Audience Member 1: Thank you so much. My name is Leo Lopez. I\u2019m here with my two daughters, 13 and 15. I think it\u2019s a very worthwhile educational experience, so I pulled them out of school. With the framework, according to Richard Rodriguez, is that the browning of America is inevitable, do you think, as a banker, that if collectively, people of color \u2014 if we own a proportionate amount of the wealth of this country, will race relations be better? So, if the demographers are right, and in 2050 we\u2019ll be 49.9 percent of the population \u2014 is my dream, of course, because most likely will not come to pass that we own 49.9 percent of the wealth. Would that make things better? And am I wrong in championing that idea amongst us that we have a responsibility to build equity in that sense? Well, I think we definitely have a responsibility to actually build equity. I \u2014 there\u2019s something I call \u201Ctargeted universalism\u201D And where we want to get to is not simply what whites have. We actually need to state what is our goal. And then our way of getting there will vary based on how we are situated. And different groups are situated differently. So we just say, \u201CLet\u2019s have our proportionate share of what whites have.\u201D That\u2019s an improvement over where we are now, but it\u2019s not far enough. But the other thing is that, when we talk about this beloved community, from our perspective, we\u2019re talking about what I call a circle of human concern, a circle of concern for all life, human life, and I would say non-human life as well. And in that effort, it\u2019s important to make sure that people of color are really valued and situated and have resources and political and other power that other groups have. But it\u2019s also important to actually continue to be in relationship to whites. I think, ultimately \u2014 a healthy world really requires, not just a restructuring of what people of color have, but a restructuring of white identity. And that\u2019s not a project that we\u2019ve taken on because the serious problem \u2014 in the 1960s, Bundy wrote about the Negro Problem at the Ford Foundation. But today, I would write about the white problem. We really need to come to terms with the white problem, not in a negative way, not in terms of white guilt, not in terms of beating up on whites, but really trying to help whites \u2014 because we are deeply related \u2014 give birth to a different identity. Audience Member 2: Hi, Dr. Powell. I work right across the street at Minneapolis Community and Technical College, and I know that we have a St. Paul Public Schools principal in the audience. And you talk a lot about interdependence. And I\u2019m wondering, if you were the czar of U.S. public education, what questions would you ask us to ask ourselves? The first question I would ask you to ask yourself is, why do we have a czar? I think no one person, maybe with the exception of Einstein \u2014 no one person is smarter than all of us. And so part of it\u2019s, how do we come together and learn together? And it\u2019s actually interesting because I\u2019m doing that around the country right now. I\u2019m working probably six different school districts including Oakland and Seattle and several others. And usually they invite me in for some particular issue. They don\u2019t usually invite me in to be the czar, but they\u2019re having a problem. And the problem is usually organized, frankly, around \u2014 the schools have growing diversity, and they have a \u2014 what I call \u2014 opportunity gap between the white students and the students of color. The best school system or one of the best school systems in the United States was the Wake County school system. That\u2019s the research triangle, which has more PhDs than any other area of the country. It was actually quite interesting because they took it to the voters. And they said, \u201CDo you want to have this school system which is educationally and economically integrated?\u201D And the voters said, \u201CNo.\u201D So then they took it to the politicians, and they said, \u201CThis makes sense, which the voter said no, but would you vote for it as a politician?\u201D The politician said, \u201CNo.\u201D And then the business community said, \u201CUnless you do something about the school system in Wake County, we\u2019re leaving.\u201D It was actually the business community that pushed it through. And that\u2019s just one example. It\u2019s just not that hard. But what we do is we say we want change but not in my neighborhood. Go fix North Minneapolis, or go fix this place, but my school is fine. And your school might be fine, academically. But in a country as diverse as ours, and that\u2019s becoming more diverse, if you\u2019re not learning in a diverse setting, you\u2019re being miseducated. So these things are not simple. I mean, there are some things we can do, but as we lean into it, we\u2019ll find that they\u2019re more and more complicated. But they\u2019re also fascinating. I mean, this is sort of an interesting world we live in. It\u2019s so important that you name the problems. And then you talk about how fascinating this is, right? There\u2019s something about us defining \u2014 going into these conversations and going into deliberations about what\u2019s to be done, treating it as a problem and an issue and a burden \u2014 and it may be all of those things \u2014 but also life-giving work and fascinating work\u2026 I think that\u2019s right. \u2026that will make us \u2014 each one of us more whole. Well, part of the thing \u2014 as a country, we really don\u2019t like talking about race. Part of this is because it\u2019s a hard conversation, and oftentimes, we do it badly. And it\u2019s like if you have a party, and you invite people to your party, and it\u2019s a bad party. Then you say, \u201CI\u2019m going to have another party next weekend.\u201D And it\u2019s like, \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D \u201CI\u2019m out of town.\u201D But it\u2019s like, \u201CCome. Let\u2019s talk about white privilege and about\u2026\u201D Right. \u201CI think I\u2019m busy.\u201D Yeah. Audience Member 3: Thank you, Dr. powell. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the dualism in our language and move toward a more unitive consciousness. What you were talking about in your entire interview. Thank you. Well, thank you for the question. I say to my students that when something is binary and dualistic, just interrogate it. Because life is interesting, complicated, messy, and then sometimes there are throughlines through it. And in terms of the self \u2014 I actually talk about the multiple selves, that we actually have multiple identities. And in a really healthy society, I believe we will claim our multiple identities and on every level. I mean, some places, my most salient identity will be that I\u2019m a tall black man. Sometimes it\u2019s going to be that I\u2019m over 60. Sometimes it\u2019s going to be that, somewhere along the way, I lost some hair. And one might be that I\u2019m a cancer survivor. I mean, things, our identities, keep changing. And if we allow the space, they will change. It\u2019s that adage \u2014 you may have heard it \u2014 \u201CTo be or not to be?\u201D That\u2019s the answer. Audience Member 4: Hello. I\u2019m Lawrence Waddell. And I have a question about the psychological part \u2014 wondered if you could speak to things like stigma. For instance, Krista had on Desmond Tutu, and I remember this story he spoke about \u2014 he said he was on an airplane. And he said it was his proudest moment; there were two black pilots. And then the plane had trouble in the air, and he\u2019s thinking, \u201CHey, there are no white pilots up there.\u201D Who\u2019s going to fly this\u2026 Audience Member 4: I thought it was completely courageous and honest to speak to how, let\u2019s say, ubiquitous this issue is of stigma and the psychological part of what we\u2019re trying to get over. I don\u2019t know of psychologists who deal with the trauma that has happened. I\u2019m just wondering if you had any thoughts on it. Sure, there\u2019s actually a lot on this. There\u2019s the whole mind science. There is a website called the Project Implicit, where you can actually go and take a test to see \u2014 what you\u2019re describing are these unconscious processes. The unconscious, actually, is very fast and very big. And it actually makes associations based on frequency. So if you show Pavlov\u2019s dog, the ringing the bell and the salivating, the bell has nothing to do with food. Right? But if you ring the bell and feed the dog, ring the bell, feed the dog, pretty soon, the dog will actually associate the bell and food. So if you show a picture of a black man and crime, we\u2019re like Pavlov\u2019s dog. At an unconscious level, we\u2019ll create a neural linkage between crime and black. The same in terms of \u2014 you don\u2019t see \u2014 you never see a black pilot. You actually will have an association that \u2014 \u201CWell, blacks can\u2019t fly.\u201D And this is social, right? This gets lodged into our unconscious. And most of the time, we\u2019re not aware of it. We can measure this, though. We can measure it in terms of skin resistance, pupil dilation, and it actually slows us up. Sometimes our conscious beliefs and our unconscious practices are in conflict. And it actually slows us down, creates anxiety, creates what they call \u201Ccognitive depletion.\u201D So part of the thing is just being aware of this. And it doesn\u2019t make us bad. It makes us human. That\u2019s what intelligence is. It\u2019s making these associations. Once we find them, though, we can then start to make interventions to interrupt them. So one female math teacher does not disrupt the stereotype that women can\u2019t do math. We need a critical mass. We need a number. And we need to talk about it. And again, on issues of race, we\u2019ve learned, through the ideology of colorblindness, we\u2019re not supposed to notice. We\u2019re not supposed to say what Desmond Tutu said. So part of it is having the courage to just say, you know, if Krista feels uncomfortable sitting here with me, she can say, \u201CI notice something.\u201D Right? Now, she\u2019s not likely to say that. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not uncomfortable. I think we\u2019re really comfortable with each other. But if she were to say that, she\u2019d likely get blasted. \u201CShe\u2019s a racist. She\u2019s this, she\u2019s that.\u201D But we all have these discomforts. So part of it is to create space where we can actually unearth these discomforts and help each other get beyond them, but also to have these practices. The first pilot won\u2019t disrupt the stereotype that pilots are white. You need a critical mass. I love this \u2014 the science of implicit bias, where it\u2019s worth all of us learning about because it is liberating from blame or self-blame. So it takes it out of that realm, but it is knowledge that is a form of power. If we can acknowledge this and know it about ourselves, then we start to have some kind of control over it. That\u2019s exactly right. The thing about implicit bias \u2014 and it\u2019s a whole field. It\u2019s all really blowing up since\u2026 With the police \u2014 yeah. \u2026the last 30 years. And also, there\u2019s a lot going on now with police forces. It was already happening. We\u2019re starting to train police forces. The city of Seattle has agreed to be \u2014 have 10,000 employees trained on implicit bias. And it\u2019s huge. I mean, it\u2019s just very big. And it\u2019s sort of unfortunate we call it \u201Cbias\u201D because it\u2019s really \u2014 implicit means unconscious or not fully conscious. And the reality is everyone has that. That\u2019s the human nature. And what\u2019s in our implicit biases are social. They\u2019re not individual. So in a society where we treat blacks a certain way \u2014 and we\u2019ve done this. We looked at 11 million words that most people use over their lifetime. How frequently do you use \u201Cblack\u201D with negative? And it\u2019s very high. It\u2019s like 40-50 percent of the time. So all the time. That\u2019s what you hearing, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing. It\u2019s the air that we breathe. You breathe that until you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re going to have those associations. Whites will have them. Blacks will have them. Latinos will have them. If you have negative associations in a society about women, men will have them and women will have them. But they\u2019re social. So we have negative associations in this society about Muslims. They don\u2019t have those negative associations in Turkey. So those associations are social. So part of it means that we have to look at what those associations are and where they come from. And we can create some prophylactic thing. But ultimately, we need to change the environment itself. Right. We change the \u201Cwe,\u201D we change the \u201CI.\u201D That\u2019s right. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, opening up the race narrative with esteemed thinker and legal scholar john a powell. We\u2019re with a live audience at the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis. One more question? Yeah. Audience Member 6: Hi. My name is , and I work for Ramsey County. And Cornel West says, \u201CJustice is what love looks like in public.\u201D And I\u2019m wondering, can public policy help in making confidence in love infectious? Well, I think public policy can help a lot. There\u2019s some research to say that if you want to change people\u2019s mind, you change behavior. And if you want to change behavior, you change institutions. That is a debate: which is first? But clearly, they infect and affect each other. So how do we actually think about policies and structures that reflect our deepest values, our way of connecting? Think of something like restorative justice in schools. Think about actually giving expression to our ability to love each other. Think about holding up people who are \u2014 there\u2019s a group at Berkeley called \u201CThe Greater Good.\u201D So I think there are ways in which governments and private \u2014 industry as well can actually lean into this. There\u2019s a whole thing about a caring economy. How do we actually learn to care for each other? We did this with Americorps, we did a little bit with the Peace Corps. I think, in a healthy society, we would actually care for each other, not by just giving money, but by being in relationship with each other, by actually sharing each other\u2019s suffering. I\u2019ll tell you a story. My dad is, like I said, he\u2019ll be 95 this year. When my mom died, they had this wonderful relationship. I mean, it was really out of a storybook. So people would say, well, \u201CGrowing up, you know how when your mom and dad fight?\u201D And I said, \u201C Actually, I don\u2019t.\u201D This just wasn\u2019t our experience. So when my mom died, and my dad was, like \u2014 he was ready to be done. And so he got a serious disease. They thought it was cancer, and they said they needed to operate. And he said, \u201CNo.\u201D He said, \u201CYou know, I\u2019ve lived long enough. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201D And all the kids got around, and we said, \u201CIf you need to go, Dad, you can go. But we still need you.\u201D He said, \u201CYou\u2019re all grown.\u201D So I did some research on this tumor, and I went back to him and shared the research to him. And I said, \u201CDad, I just want you to know, if you want to go, that\u2019s fine. But there\u2019s a chance that tumor will explode in your body, cause excruciating pain, and not kill you.\u201D And he said, \u201COK, OK. I\u2019ll have the operation.\u201D And then I said, \u201CSo Dad, why do you think\u201D \u2014 \u2018cause he\u2019s very Christian \u2014 I said, \u201CWhat do you think God is keeping you here for?\u201D And he said, \u201CI guess my last lesson to teach the kids is how to care for me.\u201D And so instead of seeing it as a burden because he needs care, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s my last gift to you is to teach you how to care. And it really is wonderful. So I think that when you \u2014 in a healthy society \u2014 we not just have the words that we\u2019re related, that we actually learn to care for each other, and we celebrate that. And I think policy can help that, like Good Samaritan laws. I think a lot of things we can do. But I think it needs to be animated by a sense that we are connected, that we share each other, and yes, that we, in fact, love each other. Oh. I have to say \u2014 I\u2019m just going to say, honestly, in this room, I feel what is evident in John Powell\u2019s work and in this room is that the worst things that happen also don\u2019t define us. There\u2019s more to our struggle with this that\u2019s alive and potentially redemptive. John, I think you\u2019ve been answering this question the whole time, but I do want to ask you, just in closing, in the course of your life, your evolution as a human being, the multiplicity of yourself, how would you talk about how you think, at this point, about what it means to be human, how you would begin to describe that? And whether \u2014 that may or may not include the word \u201Crace.\u201D That\u2019s a big question. So I\u2019ll tell you a story. I went to Stanford, and I was one of the co-founders of the Black Student Union at Stanford. And we had a meeting, and in that meeting, we decided that there were some definitely some good white people, but not that many. And it took a lot of energy to find them. The transaction cost of finding good white people was way too high. So we decided, \u201COK. Let\u2019s stop trying to find these \u2014 let\u2019s not relate to white people.\u201D Actually, I did not support that position, but that\u2019s where the group went. And I left the meeting. It was about noon. And I was walking across Stanford. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve actually been to Stanford, but the center part of Stanford is very busy, especially at noon. And there\u2019s always people teeming about. And I\u2019m walking back across campus in this area, and there\u2019s nobody there. It\u2019s empty. And all the time I was at Stanford, I\u2019d never seen that part of the campus like that. And then there\u2019s this one woman walking toward me. Again, the physical space where students hang out is actually quite small, so you see students all the time. I\u2019d never seen this woman before, and I never saw her again. And as she\u2019s walking toward me, I notice she\u2019s blind. And she has a cane. And she walks into a maze of bicycles. And I said, \u201COh, that\u2019s too bad.\u201D And as she turns, knocks down bicycles, she starts panicking. And I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s really sad, but we just made this agreement. It\u2019s not my problem. I keep walking. She turns again, and she knocks down more bicycles. And finally, I can\u2019t walk past her. And I go over to her, and I take her out of the maze of bicycles. And then she goes on her way. And I go back to the meeting, and I say, \u201CI can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t adhere to that agreement.\u201D And to me, that was one of the defining moments. And I sort of, like \u2014 I\u2019m not a theist, but I wonder, how did the universe send that woman to me? That she helped me to engage and claim my humanity that took me on a different path. And I think being human is about being in the right kind of relationships. I think being human is a process. It\u2019s not something that we just are born with. We actually learn to celebrate our connection, learn to celebrate our love. And the thing about it \u2014 if you suffer, it does not imply love. But if you love, it does imply suffering. So part of the thing that I think what being human means to love and to suffer, to suffer with, though, compassion, not to suffer against. So to have a space big enough to suffer with. And if we can hold that space big enough, we also have joy and fun even as we suffer. And suffering will no longer divide us. And to me, that\u2019s sort of the human journey. Thank you so much.
