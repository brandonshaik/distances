  "fullText": "The technologist and social media influencer Anil Dash has written this of the industry he helped create: \u201CWe fancy ourselves outlaws while we shape laws, and consider ourselves disruptive without sufficient consideration for the people and institutions we disrupt. We have to do better, and we will.\u201D Anil Dash has been an early, vocal activist for moral imagination in the digital sphere, including advocating for metrics that encourage generative behaviors online. This has become a galvanizing discussion since the 2016 presidential election. What is arguably the most powerful industry in human history has entered the lives of most people on Earth with openly world-changing ambitions \u2014 but without a deliberate process of ethics, inclusivity, and accountability. With Anil Dash, we explore this unprecedented power, the learning curves we\u2019re on, and how we can all contribute to the humane potential of technology in this moment we inhabit. We\u2019re still sounding our way through this incorporation of technology into our lives. And it always does come down to \u2014 what are our values? And what do we care about? And what are the things we think are meaningful? And then using that as a filter to understand and control and make decisions around these new technologies. And that\u2019s part of the reckoning I\u2019d ask everybody who\u2019s not in technology to have, is to raise that flag. At the time when somebody says, \u201CYou\u2019ve got to try this new app,\u201D \u201CYou\u2019ve got to use this new tool,\u201D think through what are the implications of, one, me using this, but two, if everybody does. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with Anil Dash in a public event at the Avalon Theater in Easton, Maryland. We were there at the invitation of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Wye Fellows and the Dock Street Foundation. A long, long time ago, when we set the title for tonight, it was \u201CEmerging Technologies and Old Fashioned Civics.\u201D And I was thinking today that we should rename it \u201CEmerging Technologies and Their Interaction with Emerging Politics and the Civics We Have.\u201D I\u2019ll take it. Or maybe \u201CThe Civics We Need.\u201D I\u2019ll take it. OK. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re gonna go. So, something you\u2019re known for inside your industry in Silicon Valley is knowing how systems work. And you\u2019ve said you\u2019re almost kind of obsessed about this. Whether it\u2019s the way people adopt new technologies, or the ways governments regulate markets, or the ways new ideas spring up in popular culture. So I\u2019m curious if you \u2014 how do you trace that? Where does that come from in you? Or when did it surface? I got my first computer in the household \u2014 we had a Commodore computer when I was 5 years old my father brought home for us to tinker on. And so I started coding when I was 5. And my \u2014 as my son has done too. It\u2019s like, oh, these things must be contagious. And what became \u2014 my impression of what a computer was was a tool you use to create and not to consume. And I think that influenced my view of what everything else was. And through that lens, I came to understand that newspapers were that, that the low-fidelity, homemade broadcasts that sort of presaged YouTube that people were doing on Public Access was that same thing, that all these things \u2014 that hip hop music, which I loved, was people taking the tools they had and using the technology in new ways to express themselves. And that was the lens that sort of revealed the whole rest of the world, or at least where the media and entertainment and communications world was headed. Also, you are a critic on the inside. You were pointing out contradictions and flaws in the tech industry at this stage. And I think that it\u2019s good for us all to step back and realize this all has happened so quickly. And unfortunately, we\u2019re not doing the work of discernment in advance; we\u2019re doing it after the fact, which is how humans tend to function. Right? So you say nobody in your industry is saying, \u201CI\u2019m setting out to make the patriarchy worse. I\u2019m setting out to \u2014 I\u2019m saying I\u2019m a rebel, but really\u2026\u201D I take it back. Some are now. Some are? OK. So that\u2019s the innovation that \u2014 we\u2019ve broken the seal on that now. That\u2019s great. They\u2019re not saying, \u201CI\u2019m being a rebel, but I\u2019m acting like a robber baron.\u201D That\u2019s another way you\u2019ve talked about it. They\u2019re saying, \u201CI\u2019m making a tool.\u201D And you\u2019re saying, \u201CThat\u2019s not good enough anymore.\u201D Yeah. We bake our values into the choices we make when we design these tools. And the sort of turning point in my career about a dozen years ago was I was building some of the early blogging and social media tools. And the tools that my friends and I built were used to publish and launch Gawker and Huffington Post and many of these early blogs that became sort of seminal to the medium. And it was interesting because there were hints all along that the choices we made, like on a whiteboard in our meeting room, had implications. So for example, there\u2019s a box you type in, just like when you write an email, the box you type in when you write a message. And we would made the box bigger in the publishing tool, and the posts on Gawker and on Huffington Post would get longer, right? And we see this today where \u2014 anybody who\u2019s used Instagram, you see yourself \u2014 you see people framing their photo to be square because it\u2019s going to be shared in a square format, even though the phone itself can take a rectangular photo, and every other photo over the last century has been a certain other shape, and here we are making this adjustment. And so \u2014 I never connected the dots that while we have complete control over exactly how many words a journalist uses in writing a story by changing things that are arbitrary variables for us, and yet we would not connect the dots all the way through into all the choices we make about how communities work online, how people respond to each other, how accountable they are to each other. Those would have social impacts too. At that point, suddenly we would divest ourselves of responsibility. It\u2019s interesting, this moment we inhabit. We now say \u2014 and I think this is true \u2014 that we have a fifth estate as well as a fourth estate, this new sphere, which is public life, whether it\u2019s set out to be or not, which is highly influential and has been incredibly influential in a presidential election now. As a journalist, I see a lot of, actually, consonance between this kind of moral challenge that tech has and the moral challenge that journalism has. And they got all so mixed up and intertwined in this election. But I think the notion that \u2014 \u201CThis is what we do. We tell the news. We report what happened today. This is the form we use.\u201D But when it colludes with technology, and when you see the tools themselves formed the craft \u2014 I mean, the 24-7 news cycle itself created the way journalism was functioning rather than the other way around. Very much so. Yeah, I mean, not to be glib, but it\u2019s even worse than you describe. The thing that I\u2019ve seen in particular in online media was \u2014 the world into which we started creating the social media tools around the turn of the century \u2014 it makes me sound like I\u2019m ancient \u2014 I am ancient. The thing that jumped out to me was it was not centralized. There were \u2014 everybody had an individual site. And what happened in short order, in about half a decade, was Google became the front door to all the content. You would go through one search engine and one news site, and that would be your entry point more or less. And one or two advertising platforms sort of took over, Facebook, Google. And the people designing the products are well-intentioned. They are sincere in saying, \u201CI\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 we\u2019ll just make it easy. We\u2019ll bring the content from all these different publishers, New York Times, Buzzfeed, and we\u2019ll put it all onto the Facebook platform or onto the Google platform and bring it inside our walls and make it fast and easy for everybody to browse on their phones. Now incidentally, what happens with that is \u2014 \u201CWe\u2019re just going to remove all of those other advertising and clutter things that are happening from all other companies that aren\u2019t Facebook or Google.\u201D So you can say, \u201CWe have our own staff of journalists and our own writers, and they\u2019re out there reporting, and they\u2019re doing everything. We are the masters of our own destiny.\u201D But I don\u2019t think that the publishers understand the tradeoff they\u2019re making. And it\u2019s because of the social positioning of, technology as neutral. So like, \u201CWe\u2019re a neutral platform anybody can publish on.\u201D And then when you get to the current state of affairs, which is when you sell advertising, you are brokering attention. And so something that draws more attention and has more emotional appeal will be more successful and more lucrative. Then you say, well, some of the things that are most attention-getting aren\u2019t true. The Facebook fake news that we\u2019re hearing about now. Right. I mean, the Facebook fake news \u2014 I have to say I just thought it was just astonishing that Twitter played a role in a presidential election the way it did. I just \u2014 I don\u2019t know who saw that coming. And then, of course, the catastrophe of polling, and the fact that you had algorithms, but people weren\u2019t making\u2026 That\u2019s a perfect example. I got to watch Twitter from before its public launch. I know the founders and a lot of the leadership very well, less so as there\u2019s been a lot of regime change there. Regime change. That\u2019s to your point that these are now titans. Yeah, exactly. But they were very vocal about their role in Arab Spring. Yes. They were very vocal about how everybody in Tahrir Square is using Twitter. And when they at least nominally liked the results, then Twitter was taking the credit. And when they don\u2019t like the results, Twitter is a neutral tool. Right? And I\u2019ve been that guy. I\u2019m not pointing fingers. But we did learn that lesson. And then if you look at every other professional discipline, you look at somebody who goes to law school, somebody who goes to business school, journalism school, medical school, every single one of those disciplines has a professional society that sets standards. And if you don\u2019t meet them, you can be disbarred. You can lose your medical license. There\u2019s an expectation about what you\u2019re supposed to do. And in the educational process, there\u2019s an extensive ethical curriculum. The bridge has to stay up; it can\u2019t fall down. You have a historical tradition where, in medicine, they\u2019re going back to Hippocrates. In law, you\u2019re like talking about English common law that happened centuries ago. And then in computer science, they\u2019re sort of radically anti-historical. Not even ahistorical, just like, there is nothing before now. We refuse to see \u2014 there is no before time. And there is zero ethical curriculum. You can get a top-of-the-line, the highest credential computer science degree from the most august institutions with essentially having had zero ethics training. And that is, in fact, the most likely path to getting funded as a successful startup in Silicon Valley. Do you think that\u2019s partly because, as we say, it\u2019s such a young field? Some of it is we haven\u2019t had centuries to mature. But then it\u2019s so rapidly \u2014 achieve this disproportionate authority and power. That\u2019s right. I mean the difference is in these centuries\u2026 And we also haven\u2019t thought of it as a discipline yet. Right, right. And the centuries over which engineering was maturing or that medicine was maturing, they worked it out, right? There were a lot of, like, \u201CWell, that\u2019s not actually medicine; that\u2019s just butchery. Let\u2019s clean that up.\u201D Right? But at that time, they weren\u2019t the wealthiest industry in the history of the world, so they had some time to work it out. And we didn\u2019t do that. And we meanwhile amassed all of that power and all of that wealth, and I think that\u2019s the reckoning we haven\u2019t come to. And the stakes are incredibly, incredibly high. I think we\u2019re really going to face a reckoning as the economic impacts of that get stronger, as the cultural impacts of that get stronger. The idea that the halo around tech as \u201Cthe good guys\u201D is gonna sustain seems increasingly unlikely. I want to read something that danah boyd wrote that you recommended. She\u2019s been on the show. She\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s incredible. She\u2019s another person many people outside of tech may not have heard of, but she\u2019s a real leader and a great thinker. So she wrote \u2014 and I want to say before this, again, I hold journalists accountable, and I think this exact same conversation has to happen among journalists because there was a way \u2014 but you almost watched journalism not know how to \u2014 it was all so fast-breaking in the 2016 election\u2026 And so extreme. \u2026because something that you might morally want not to cover became news anyway. But still, I think there\u2019s a huge reckoning. But anyway, she wrote, \u201CI believe in data, but data itself has become spectacle. I cannot believe that it has become acceptable for media entities to throw around polling data without any critique of the limits of that data, to produce fancy visualizations which suggest that numbers are magical information.\u201D As you said, \u201CIn the tech sector, we imagined that decentralized networks would bring people together for a healthier democracy.\u201D And there\u2019s that idealism that I think really was there and is there in journalism too. And then she says, \u201CWe hung onto this belief even as we saw that this wasn\u2019t playing out. We built the structures for hate to flow along the same pathways as knowledge, but we kept hoping that this wasn\u2019t really happening. We aided and abetted the media\u2019s suicide.\u201D That\u2019s fair. I bet a lot of you saw on election night, on The New York Times homepage, their animated, live, real-time data. They had these needles waving back and forth on the meter, which I think is probably the single most stressful implementation of technology I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. And what it was \u2014 and I always think of this \u2014 actually, with systems thinking in general, in any institution, I always try to imagine the meeting \u2014 back track a few months, a few weeks to the whiteboard meeting, and a bunch of people with empty coffee cups sitting around sketching out what this thing is going to be. And somebody says \u2014 and it\u2019s probably a young guy, and he\u2019s probably a computer science grad \u2014 and he says, \u201CYou know, we can get the data in real time. We can get polling data, and we can put it on the homepage. And it\u2019ll be incredibly compelling.\u201D And if you look at the page that made up that New York Times homepage while they were doing that chart on election night \u2014 and there were these wild swings of the needle for a long while. For hours, it was literally swinging back and forth between Clinton and Trump in \u201Creal time,\u201D what they called \u201Creal time.\u201D Right. And if you look at the code of the page, that was all fake. The data only updated, at most, a few times a minute. The needle never stopped moving. But I could see that. And what percentage of people that went to that page that night could see that? Maybe one percent, maximum. And it was so \u2014 one, it was causing undue stress to a lot of people. Two, it was, as danah said, making spectacle of data explicitly. And the animation was not true. It was not real. And so what does it mean that there was a choice to put something false on their homepage when they are trying to decry all the falsity? And would they have allowed falsity from any other public-facing part of their organization except the technologists? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Anil Dash, the entrepreneur and activist for humane technology. Should we talk about Facebook, or is that like going down a rabbit hole? I\u2019ve heard of it. Is it a billion people around the world? More than that. More than that. That is \u2014 you\u2019re right. That is just so many. And so again, it\u2019s like \u2014 when I was preparing for this, I was thinking I don\u2019t usually have interviews where we talk about a company, but this is more than just a company. This is a human potential that is right now embodied in Facebook. But who knows if Facebook will be around 10 years from now? But the capacity to have the attention of a billion people. Yeah. It\u2019s profound. I think when we \u2014 I started blogging in 1999. I was talking to people that were building the early social networking, social media tools. And I remember talking to a friend of mine, saying, \u201CSomeday \u2014\u201D well, at that time I started, there was like 50 or 100 blogs. And I\u2019m like, \u201CI\u2019m late.\u201D Right? Like, \u201CSomebody\u2019s taken all the good ideas.\u201D And then the other 100 million showed up, and I was like, \u201CMaybe I was early.\u201D And that was true with social networks was \u2014 the first time I met Mark Zuckerberg, he came to visit the company I was working at in San Francisco. And Facebook was \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 six people, and they were at a couple colleges. And because they\u2019re in uncharted territory, unprecedented territory, it\u2019s hard to know when they\u2019re making good choices and just choices. And no one can anticipate the way that network effects play out at that scale because no one\u2019s ever done that before. And I keep stumbling over one sort of anecdote. It\u2019s got two sides to it. One is the ongoing and very important industry discussion we\u2019re having in tech around inclusion and diversity, and who gets to participate and who gets to profit. And Facebook\u2019s numbers look essentially like most of the companies in Silicon Valley, which is to say in California, which you presumably know the demographics of. They regularly have the technical staff of these companies be less than two percent black or less than two percent Latino workers. And 40 percent of Californians are Latino. So it\u2019s a huge, huge disconnect. And for many years, the conversation has been, \u201CWell, the pipeline\u2019s not there, and you don\u2019t have enough people graduating from CS programs.\u201D And the moment I started to realize that there was something really truly amiss even beyond that was when you looked at the marketing staff or the legal staff or the administration staff, the non-technical roles of these companies, and the same thing was true. OK. So they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t in need of the same new pipeline. Right. You can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s no black lawyers in California. You can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s no Latino marketers in California. So that\u2019s the first part of the Facebook story, to me, about their reckoning with who they are and who profits from what they do. And the second part was Whatsapp, which is an incredibly popular \u2014 may be the most popular messaging app in the world. I use it to talk to my family in India. Most of the rest of the world uses it a lot more than the States. And Facebook understood its value because it was the thing that\u2019s used by the rest of the world. And they bought it at the time when the team was maybe 20 people building Whatsapp. It was a very, very small team. They bought Whatsapp for what ended up being over 20 billion dollars, 22 billion dollars when the deal closed. And a board seat for the founder. He\u2019s on the board of Facebook now. And he\u2019s a very smart guy, very incredible team. And the decision to make that purchase, even though Facebook\u2019s a publicly traded company and all these things, happened in about four or five days. So when Mark Zuckerberg cares about something, and Facebook cares about something, they can deploy 20+ billion dollars in less than a week. That\u2019s the scale of what it looks like when they really want to move on something, and they really want to deploy their resources and commit to it. You\u2019ve written a lot also about how echo chambers emerge from the algorithms. Do you read Seth Godin? Do you follow him? Yeah. So Seth Godin is a kind of mentor to me and to a lot of good people. And he\u2019s been in tech, like you, a long time before it was what it is. And he wants to insist that one thing that sets our generation \u2014 and by which I mean all of us \u2014 apart from previous generations of humans is that we can create our own tribes beyond bloodline and geography, that that is one thing that technology makes possible for us. I just want to know how you \u2014 do you also see that as something that this technology makes possible? Do you see this happening? How do you think through how we navigate the danger of bubbles, and then this amazing capacity this gives us to walk out of them? That was the thing that drew me to sort of the internet era. Like, I liked computers, but for half my life, the computer wasn\u2019t plugged into anything. It was sort of this island. And then it sort of woke up once it got connected to other people. Got conscious. Yes. I mean, it\u2019s hard to explain to the young people I mentor in the tech industry now that we had computers that didn\u2019t have the internet. And they\u2019re like, \u201CWhat would you do with it?\u201D Like, what do you \u2014 you just stare at it. It\u2019s like a TV that doesn\u2019t have an antenna or a cable. What do you do with that? You just bask in the rays. And that\u2019s what we did. And so that was \u2014 I would say far less than 10 percent of the people creating these tools today think that they should distinguish between the uses of these social tools as to whether they\u2019re being used for constructive purposes or destructive purposes. And what they\u2019re afraid of is a lot of things. I think one is that, \u201CWell, who are we to judge? We don\u2019t want to presume.\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CYou\u2019re not humble.\u201D Like, the tech industry\u2026 Right. The false modesty of the tech industry is the most ridiculous argument that they start with because at the same time they\u2019re like, \u201CWe\u2019re here to change the world. We\u2019re going to put rockets on Mars and make self-driving cars, but we don\u2019t want to presume too much.\u201D And so that\u2019s sort of the starting point. And then they get into, \u201CIt\u2019s really hard, and it takes people.\u201D As it turns out, yes. Yeah, it does. It takes human judgement. And you have to say where you sit, and you have to make a call, and you have to make some people angry because they didn\u2019t get to be jerks on your platform. I mean, and that\u2019s even stopping short of saying, \u201CWe are going to encourage generative relationships,\u201D right? Yes, yes. Robust civics. Not just everybody being nice and banning bad voices, but something that\u2019s robust where difference is being engaged. Or explicitly designing for good behavior. Yeah. I mean, you\u2019ve talked about sort of how we measure and what we measure, and how \u2014 you\u2019ve written a lot about \u2014 you have a huge social media following, and you\u2019ve written a lot about what that means and what it doesn\u2019t mean, really in a very searching way. You\u2019ve said, could we have metrics about how we\u2019re presenting, about whether we\u2019re listening, about whether we\u2019re showing gratitude? Like, could we decide some \u2014 and we could do this with social psychology, right? We could use science that\u2019s out there about what makes for healthier, happier lives that affect the world around them positively. And you\u2019re suggesting that these platforms could actually give us feedback on those things. Yeah. For years, I was building a tool with a friend of mine, Gina Trapani. We actually built a company around it. It didn\u2019t really succeed, but we had built this tool that let you see really how you were interacting with people online, and how often you congratulated somebody or thanked somebody, how often you amplified the voice of somebody that had a smaller platform than you did, how often you \u2014 we sort of conceptualized a lot of generative behaviors, a lot of positive behaviors, a lot of good civic behaviors. \u201CHow many times have you apologized?\u201D And would just recognize it, give it back to people, show them this is what you did, and this is how you\u2019re progressing. And gentle correctives about \u2014 like, \u201CWell, you\u2019ve talked about yourself a lot.\u201D What percentage of all the things you\u2019ve shared on Facebook or Twitter were about yourself, and you saying \u201CI\u201D versus somebody else? And not prescriptive. We didn\u2019t say, \u201CDon\u2019t do this.\u201D If we hold up a mirror, what do you see? And what\u2019s your judgment about it? And we ended up with, not a very large base of users, but a very, very dedicated base of users. I mean, the people that were using the tool \u2014 the emails I got were incredible. One of the things we\u2019d spent a lot of time on was a look back \u2014 what were you doing a year ago, two years ago, three years ago? And then the tricky things that come out \u2014 and we spent a ton of time thinking about, which I think this is part of why Facebook and others who made similar features screwed it up even worse than we did, was \u2014 we would do things like mention somebody you had spoken to last a year ago and say \u2014 at first, it was like, \u201CDo you want to get back in touch with Jim? You haven\u2019t talked to him in a year.\u201D And really quickly, before we even put it out in front of the users, we were like, \u201DWe can\u2019t do that.\u201D It has to be \u2014 \u201CIsn\u2019t it amazing how time flies?\u201D was how we described it because sometimes somebody who did want to be reminded to get back in touch with that person. Sometimes they hadn\u2019t spoken them for a reason, and there was a lot of weight behind that. Sometimes the person had passed away. Facebook built a year in review, a look back. And the first time \u2014 you\u2019ve seen this. And the first time it launched, an old friend of mine who had lost his daughter said \u2014 \u201CThis was the photo that got the most comments this year.\u201D And it was after she had passed at the end of that year. When he\u2019s sort of just starting to process it, it put her image back in front of him. And it stayed with me for a long time because it was eminently preventable. And again, they mean well. And Facebook did respond and sent him a thoughtful apology, which I think was sincere. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not saying these are bad people doing bad things. I\u2019m saying these are good people doing bad things. And\u2026 With a really powerful, very unformed \u2014 in fact, very unformed tool. And I have to think they could\u2019ve anticipated it. And I think there\u2019s gonna be that over and over and over. There are a lot of those mistakes to make. Are you part of a larger conversation? Do you feel that this reckoning is happening or perhaps that his recent election will spur it on? There is a larger industry conversation about inclusion and diversity. And I can tell it\u2019s working because it\u2019s starting to be co-opted. So, every tech CEO is giving lip service to it whether they\u2019re sincere or not. So it\u2019s like, OK, that\u2019s a mark of success to some degree. The idea about more thoughtful, ethical, humane technology a lot of us care about. I think there is a groundswell. And I see this in the response to what I write, to what danah boyd writes, to what Eric Meyer, who is the father I was talking about earlier \u2014 he writes \u2014 a lot of people writing thoughtful work. But what\u2019s telling, to me, and what has been very instructive is I\u2019ve looked at some of these larger social movements and moral movements. Like, I look at the success of Black Lives Matter. And it\u2019s self-organizing. People can identify and be part of something larger than themselves without it being conducted by someone. And so they can say, \u201CI\u2019m declaring a value.\u201D And in the shortness of a hashtag\u2026 Right. Extraordinary. \u2026you know what my values are. And we don\u2019t have a hashtag. We don\u2019t have a name for a movement. We don\u2019t have a shorthand way of articulating, \u201CWell, when I say this, or that I support this, that it represents this larger idea in culture.\u201D And I don\u2019t know how to get there. I wouldn\u2019t presume that I can be part of creating that. But I think when it arises, all the people who have this latent intention about being thoughtful about what technology can be will rally behind it. But I keep looking. I\u2019m always like, \u201CWhere is the brash 23-year-old creator who scares the hell out of me, who makes me feel like I\u2019m old and out of touch and I don\u2019t get it?\u201D I know they\u2019re coming. I know that person\u2019s coming, and I know they\u2019re going to have the galvanizing name and idea for this to be able to coalesce it, but\u2026 For this shaping technology to human purposes, shaping the technology enterprise? Yeah. I think for remaking the tech industry, for reforming it around being more ethical and humane. I think this is one of the most important missions around. I just think \u2014 because we have subsumed decision-making from media, from policy, from culture, from art, into the tech world, and we are influencing it. When we make the box bigger, the text gets bigger. Because we have that responsibility, then the urgency with which we have to address our moral failings is that much higher. You can listen again and share this conversation with Anil Dash through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the technologist Anil Dash, exploring the unprecedented power, the dangerous learning curves, and the humane potential of technology in this moment we inhabit. I spoke with him in a public event at the Avalon Theater in Easton, Maryland, at the invitation of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Wye Fellows and the Dock Street Foundation. You\u2019ve asked publicly, \u201CWhat is meaningful about all this time we spend online? What will we have to show for it?\u201D I think a lot of us are asking that question. You don\u2019t have to be a computer scientist to ask that question. No. Helps if you\u2019re not. I wonder how becoming a parent \u2014 you said your son is 5 now, right? Mm-hmm. Has intensified, shaped the way you\u2019re working with these questions this kind of soul searching. It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve been blogging for \u2014 what \u2014 17 years. It takes eight or nine years to get really good at it. And at 10 years in, I realized that I was going to be doing it the rest of my life. This was years before my son was born. And I started to think about, if I have a kid someday, what would they see? And almost immediately, it changed things. It made me grow up a lot real quick. And part of it was wanting to be worthy of my words living on. I mean, I think there\u2019s a real \u2014 there\u2019s a shocking ephemerality to what\u2019s happened on the internet. Most of the things that have ever been published on the internet are now gone. And that\u2019s a weird realization \u2018cause it\u2019s a young medium. And I thought I want to fight for, one, preserving my words and those of others. And two, I want to be worthy of preserving them. And we don\u2019t build the tools that way. And I think, actually, there\u2019s a very strong argument for tools that are ephemeral by design. I think having things that are designed to be short-term and just disappear is great, and we should not just rush to capture everything. There\u2019s a weirdness to ordinary conversation being sort of preserved in stone too. But some of this \u2014 some of what\u2019s there is meaningful, and it\u2019s useful for reflection. I think that\u2019s been the most powerful tool for me is to go back to something I wrote 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago and see what was right and what was wrong. And it\u2019s different, at least from my perspective, than journaling or a diary would be. Right. Previously, you would have a diary, but it would still be in a closet. And no one else would have ever seen it or would ever see it. Well, yes. And there was also \u2014 you think \u2014 you look at \u2014 any of you who have read the sort of letters between the Founding Fathers, they had an awareness that these would live on beyond them. So it\u2019s correspondence, it\u2019s nominally private, but it\u2019s got sort of a winking eye to the fact that this will be having an audience in their absence, which is a really interesting form of writing. And I think that, for me, not in the Founding Fathers sense, but in how you write sense, is very parallel to me because I write generally from a very personal place. I\u2019m on my own, and I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m in a room on my own, and there\u2019s no one around it, but with the idea that the sort of shadow that it casts, a million people could see. So my children are, right now, 18 and 22. And even in those four years, there was such an acceleration. And it was interesting also in terms of the platforms they and their friends use completely shifted. Totally different tools. Yeah. And I\u2019m actually \u2014 I find myself being really grateful that I\u2019m not a parenting \u2014 we were still in that window where I could say, \u201CNo, you will not have an iPhone until you\u2019re 14,\u201D or something, which I just don\u2019t think you can do anymore, right? And so they were already kind of formed before all of the technology entered their lives. And I know it\u2019s changed so much now in the meantime, and you have a 5-year-old. I mean, I wonder how are you thinking about that question. We don\u2019t have a very intelligent cultural conversation about how kids engage with technology at all. No. No. I think\u2026 It\u2019s like a guinea pig generation. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s also \u2014 I also think of the concept of \u201Cscreen time.\u201D When you\u2019re with young kids, you\u2019ve heard this, right? \u201CDo you limit your child\u2019s screen time?\u201D And it\u2019s like, no. I engage with what he\u2019s specifically doing. I don\u2019t limit his page time. I just choose whether he\u2019s reading a book or a magazine or whether it\u2019s something that\u2019s like a bunch of \u2014 he\u2019s 5 years old, so he likes poop jokes. But \u2014 how much of that and how much of, like, smart stuff? And so the idea that they\u2019re both on pages and are therefore equivalent is absurd, and yet we talk about screen time that way. I\u2019m like, is he playing chess on the iPad? Or is he watching funny YouTube videos of animals falling over? Which is also awesome, but different. And so that really \u2014 that always sticks with me because I think it\u2019s a very unsophisticated way to look at things, and then we carry that forward. And that\u2019s when they\u2019re very, very young, right? 2, 3, 4, 5. They first start seeing screens. And my son maybe spends 15 minutes a day on the iPad, and he loves it, and that\u2019s all he gets. But that\u2019s always been the rule for him, so it doesn\u2019t matter. And I limit it mostly just because we limit everything. I mean, you just don\u2019t let a 5-year-old do whatever they want, or you end up in hell. Are you saying \u2014 so, this is a radical idea. You apply the same wisdom you apply to other things to technology? Yeah. Yeah, well that\u2026 Well, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s part of your life. I think that was the thing. I saw so many parents \u2014 and this is not judgment. I don\u2019t judge other parents. Other parents are fine. No, we\u2019re all on this frontier, and we\u2019re learning a language. But as we\u2019re figuring it out, they treat it as if there is life \u2014 they say this \u2014 like, \u201CThis is real life, and then there\u2019s computer world.\u201D And I\u2019m like, \u201CThat\u2019s not the thing. That\u2019s not how their lives are gonna be.\u201D And I think I had an unusual perspective, in that I did start using computers before I was in kindergarten, just as my son has. And he has way better programing tools. I was like, \u201CGosh, if I had these things.\u201D He\u2019s got \u2014 because we had to do these primitive blocky green graphics on the screen when I was a kid, and he\u2019s got this Star Wars robot that he can go on the iPad and give it programming instructions, and it follows his directions to roll around the living room. And I\u2019m like, \u201CThat is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201D Like, you wait until they go to bed so you can play with it. And that\u2019s \u2014 no, he\u2019s going to listen to this I bet. So \u2014 I don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t do that. But the thing that I think about is that that\u2019s part of his life. It\u2019s not over there. It\u2019s not an artifice. It\u2019s not the virtual world. It\u2019s just life. And I think about that with so many experiences where, when we were fighting for validating social media and social networking, saying these would be important, these would be part of our lives and there\u2019s a reason to include it, it was about this idea that sharing makes something better. I fully reject the argument \u2014 people say this all the time. You know, \u201CI saw this young person in a restaurant on their own, on their phone, not interacting with anyone.\u201D What do you think they were doing? They were talking to people. Right. They were interacting with lots of humans all at once. And it makes me furious because I\u2019m saying they\u2019re being deeply social. It\u2019s not in the mode that you know, but it\u2019s actually better than when they were sitting alone at the diner with a book. And I think there\u2019s been this misunderstanding and this misapprehension about what the tech is doing. It is connecting us to people. And there\u2019s so much attention paid \u2014 and with good reason \u2014 to the bullying and the other things, the cyber bullying and all those. A general rule of thumb is anything that begins with \u201Ccyber\u201D is a lie. Like, if you say \u201Ccyber bullying\u201D or \u201Ccyber crime,\u201D it was probably \u2014 that\u2019s one of those rare areas where they \u2014 it\u2019s a behavior that existed before, and the \u201Ccyber\u201D is not the issue. So children being unkind to each other\u2026 Right. So nothing happens online that doesn\u2019t happen offline. Right. And so being able to integrate it \u2014 now it can be worse because of the network effects. It can be amplified by the immediacy and the fact that it happens in your home. But the principles can carry across. And it has to be an integrated conversation, and that\u2019s the key. It\u2019s like, how much time do you limit your child talking to their friends? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s on the phone, on the computer on messaging, in real life, in person, out in public, whatever it is. If you have a set of rules, they apply across these things. But that demands a literacy and a fluency that I think takes a serious investment in time and understanding your child\u2019s context. And that\u2019s the hard part. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Anil Dash, the entrepreneur and activist for humane technology. This matter of technology and social healing, technology and weaving common life \u2014 when I see you writing about this, I see one thing you do \u2014 which is, again, related to what you just said \u2014 is you point people to analog places close to home. Yeah. I try. We\u2019re still sounding our way through this incorporation of technology into our lives. And there are historical analogs for a lot of these things. There are things we can look back at. And the trick is to identify, where does the analog apply? And where is it irrelevant? And that line keeps shifting, especially as we learn more about the behaviors. I think \u2014 it always does come down to, what are our values? And what do we care about? And what are the things that we think are meaningful? And then using that as a filter to understand and control and make decisions around these new technologies. But those of us in the tech world have not done ordinary folks any favors around making those decisions because we\u2019ve adopted this stance that values don\u2019t apply. And that\u2019s part of the reckoning I\u2019d ask everybody who\u2019s not in technology to have, is to raise that flag. At the time when somebody says, \u201CYou\u2019ve got to try this new app,\u201D \u201CYou\u2019ve got to use this new tool,\u201D think through, what are the implications of, one, me using this, but two, what if everybody does? I look at \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 just to pick one out of a hat, like, Uber. A lot of people are like, \u201COh, you should try Uber, and it\u2019ll get you a car service.\u201D And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought really deeply about. Living in New York, being of Indian descent in particular, what happens to the taxi drivers is very personal to me. And we have a community in Queens, Jackson Heights, where it\u2019s enormous number of South Asian immigrants. And somewhere \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the number \u2014 it was like 20 percent or something of households make some of their income from driving, delivery drivers, taxi drivers, limo drivers. And there were a lot of \u2014 obviously, the taxi industry is also corrupt in its own way, so not diminishing the challenges there \u2014 but that Uber has said, \u201CWe\u2019re going to bring you in, make you a driver, and have essentially have full control over what your income is and how many fares you get, using an algorithm that\u2019s opaque to you,\u201D is terrifying. And then once they got the drivers on board \u2014 there are now more Uber drivers in New York City than there are yellow cabs \u2014 they said, \u201CBy the way, we\u2019re going to replace you all with self-driving cars as fast as we can.\u201D And that\u2019s gonna happen. And this is a crash we can see coming. That\u2019s the one we know, we anticipate. Fortunately, what you\u2019re asking people to do is think. Yeah. But these are like the \u2014 yeah. I mean\u2026 And that\u2019s it. And these are off the top of my head. These are the ones on the tip of my tongue. So over the years, I\u2019ve had conversations with people like Sherry Turkle and danah boyd, and Tiffany Shlain. This idea that is very hard for us to internalize, because we feel like this technology hasn\u2019t landed on us and taken over our lives, permeated \u2014 and it has. But we have a choice, and our choices matter. Right. And to internalize that this technology is in its infancy, and we are the grown ups in the room. Yes, yes. 100 percent. It is 100 percent up to us. It doesn\u2019t feel like that, but it\u2019s true. It doesn\u2019t. And we can ask those questions, right? When somebody says, \u201CTry out this new app,\u201D it doesn\u2019t take very long to say well, \u201CWell, what happens if this works?\u201D Everybody in the Valley \u2014 they get their company funded, they make a startup, and they say, \u201CWe desperately don\u2019t want to fail.\u201D And I\u2019m like \u2014 I\u2019m not worried about the failures; I\u2019m worried about the companies that succeed. And that\u2019s got to be the obligation of the rest of us that care about these issues, to really deeply interrogate that whenever we can. Your wildly successful Twitter feed, @anildash \u2014 is it \u2014 your name is \u201Crap game Bodhi Rook?\u201D Right now it is. Yeah. It changes a lot. OK. But I love your \u2014 you just say in your profile \u2014 I love reading Twitter profiles. I think that is such a beautiful slice of humanity, at least the ones I read. \u201CTrying to make tech a little bit more humane and ethical.\u201D I once interviewed a French geophysicist, one of the people who discovered tectonic plates, and he pointed out that the word \u201Chuman\u201D in French is the same as the word \u201Chumane.\u201D I don\u2019t know why I thought of that when I was reading this. I want to ask you how your \u2014 this life you\u2019ve lived, these obsessions you have \u2014 which I think everybody in this room is grateful you are out there having these obsessions \u2014 how would you start to talk about how this has evolved the way you think about what it means to be human, humane? What does that mean? I describe myself as being in the technology industry, but technology always means \u201Cthings invented after you were born,\u201D basically. And so there was a time when the technology industry was the wheel. And there was the time when the technology industry was fire. And its every iteration along the way has been \u2014 the first people to do agriculture were the technologists of their time. So I\u2019m just saying that context of \u201Cthis is only temporarily new\u201D has been really, really helpful for me. And I think \u2014 and I guess it\u2019s especially true, again, since becoming a parent, but just in general \u2014 like, marveling at the briefness of the time we have. And I think, how lucky to be at this genesis moment for something actually new. How rare to be at a time when things changed, even with all of the negatives that come, and all of the hard problems that come. And all of the risk that always is there when change comes. Yeah. And of course, I know how fortunate I am to be on the right side of those changes. I think \u2014 my parents are from one of the poorest and most remote parts of India. My dad\u2019s village today \u2014 a family of four around that area lives on between 600 and 800 dollars a year. And I think the quality of life improvement from my father growing up as a British subject with no vaccines and no clean running water to my son living in Manhattan is perhaps the greatest single generation leap in quality of life in the history of humanity. And so that weighs on me a lot. To be bookended by these two incredible people, like, my parents on one end and my son on the other, it feels like a grave responsibility. To get to be the conduit between the greatness of what my parents have done and the greatness of what my son will do, I think is the thing I think about every day. So it\u2019s \u2014 well, I have these tools, and they\u2019re novel now, and they will be boring very soon. And so, en route to them being boring, how can I be sure that they are just?
