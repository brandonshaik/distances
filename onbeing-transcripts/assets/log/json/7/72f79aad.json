  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, \u201CA Return to the Mystery: \u00A0Religion, Fantasy and Entertainment.\u201D Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201CPassion of the Christ\u201D was only the tip of the iceberg. \u00A0There are religious images and ideas at the heart of many popular television programs and movies, from \u201CThe Lord of the Rings\u201D to \u201CHarry Potter.\u201D And as new generations of Americans work out their spiritual and religious questions, they are increasingly turning to fantasy. I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. \u00A0I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. \u00A0Mr. \u00A0Potter, our new celebrity. Later, we\u2019ll hear more from Hogwarts, Harry Potter\u2019s school of wizardry and witchcraft. We\u2019ll also hear from Lynn Schofield Clark, who studied the ways that media images of angels and aliens are reflecting and shaping the spiritual lives of American teen-agers. First, Phyllis Tickle, a grand dame of the interpretation of religion in popular culture. \u00A0A longtime religion editor at Publisher\u2019s Weekly, she\u2019s published 12 books of her own on prayer and spiritual journey. \u00A0In 1996 Phyllis Tickle wrote an acclaimed analysis, God-Talk in America. Today we\u2019ll invite her observations about God-talk in America now. \u00A0\u201CIn the American search for meaning,\u2019 she says, `nonfiction has steadily been giving way to fiction and fantasy, and books have ceded ground to television and movies.\u201D Phyllis Tickle dates this trend from the 1995 premiere on American television of \u201CTouched by an Angel.\u201D Della Reese starred as the wise leader of a troop of angels who intervene in human affairs. \u00A0Here\u2019s a scene from that program in which a new angel wraps up her first assignment. I\u2019ve wasted so much time. Oh, but God can redeem time, God created time just as he created you. He loves you, and he\u2019s given you all the time that you need right now to do the right thing. Here\u2019s Phyllis Tickle. What happened was at that point religion, God-talk, pivoted to entertainment. \u00A0Now, that\u2019s not to say that it hadn\u2019t, you know, been there a little bit before. \u00A0It\u2019s like saying the reformation began in 1517 on Halloween day. \u00A0You know, it did and it didn\u2019t. \u00A0And in 1995 when Della Reese and Martha Williamson went on TV prime time with \u201CTouched by an Angel,\u201D something happened. \u00A0And the something that happened was that God-talk moved out of didactic and primarily out of book form and began to shift over to entertainment. \u00A0You can do so much more theology so much more safely in story. \u00A0When you\u2019re dealing with religion through story, it\u2019s much more difficult to grab the places as a listener that you disagree with the speaker, and the speaker also has \u2014 they are the teller of the tale \u2014 has the advantage of being able to drop back into poetry and into metaphor and all of those defenses that allow us sometimes to think more clearly, sometimes to think more \u2014 I suppose diffusely is the word, or less accurately. Well, I want to ask you how \u2014 and you are a person who has spent her life steeped in books and in literature and in written word \u2014 this cross-over of medium \u2014 the medium in which these ideas are being communicated, how does that change the ideas themselves or the effect they have on people? When you\u2019re reading a book you\u2019re reading consciously aware of wanting information. \u00A0When you\u2019re sitting there watching Della Reese do her thing, you\u2019re relaxed, none of your defenses is up, or very few of your defenses are up, certainly. \u00A0Everything invites a kind of melding, if you will, of the attention and of the subconscious with what\u2019s going on in front of it. \u00A0Otherwise they would not be an entertainment experience. \u00A0That\u2019s what it means, it takes us out of ourselves. \u00A0But it leaves its fingerprint or its footprint or its angel print, as the case may be, so that when it comes in as entertainment the effect is exponentially larger than it is when it comes in as deliberately pursued information. And so it\u2019s more people, and it maybe takes hold of them without them necessarily seeking it, or even knowing what\u2019s happened to them. That\u2019s right. \u00A0Where are you going to begin to argue with angels, you know? \u00A0Because you\u2019ve domesticated them into your family room week after week after week. \u00A0And we did that for nine years. \u00A0I seem to be hung on \u201CTouched by an Angel,\u201D but it\u2019s just the one that usually commentators like me will say, `Here\u2019s where you can see it.\u2019 Did you like that \u201CTouched by an Angel\u201D personally? I did not. \u00A0I found it boring. \u00A0But I also admired greatly what was happening. \u00A0I admired the fact that Della Reese is an ordained minister. More power to her. \u00A0She\u2019s preaching in her style and as God gives her to see it. \u00A0And she has chosen this really vast pulpit. This year we had this religious movie phenomenon of Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201CPassion.\u201D I\u2019m curious; I think I\u2019ve heard you say that whereas the public or observers or great newspapers like The New York Times sometimes have woken up to the phenomenon of religious books, you know, years after it happened, and they continue to be shocked every time they notice it, I wonder if \u201CThe Passion\u201D was really the beginning of something, or did it represent a trend that you\u2019ve been watching? \u00A0I mean, has religion been seeping into movies in a new way? Absolutely. \u00A0I say \u2014 and then I think, `Ooh, is this hyperbole?\u2019 But then I go right back and say it again to another audience \u2014 that probably the best theological investigation, the best theological track tape, let\u2019s put it that way, the last half of the last century was \u201CThe Matrix.\u201D We need to also be aware, as with \u201CTouched with an Angel,\u201D that there were precursors \u2014 \u201CDogma\u201D and \u201CAmerican Beauty\u201D and \u201CMagnolia\u201D and \u201CThe Truman Story.\u201D There\u2019s been a gradual buildup. \u00A0It wasn\u2019t as if \u201CMatrix\u201D came up out of nowhere. \u00A0There is a history over the last 10 years anyway of significant attempt to deal with God issues in cinema. \u00A0Some of them obviously are not as flagrantly so as \u201CMatrix.\u201D For actual delving into theology creatively, the Wachowski brothers definitely, I think, since Niebuhr anyway, I think you\u2019ve got to say that \u201CThe Matrix\u201D was pure God-talk. Cultural observer Phyllis Tickle. \u00A0She\u2019s not the first person to call \u201CThe Matrix\u201D a theological movie. \u00A0\u201CThe Matrix\u201D has spawned seminars, academic conferences, and an entire Internet culture. \u00A0The three \u201CMatrix\u201D movies are full of Buddhist and Gnostic images as well as a generous measure of language and plotline suggestive of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For example, the last city in which the fate of humankind will be determined is called Zion. \u00A0The savior who becomes both human and divine in \u201CMatrix\u201D terms is called Neo, or the new man. \u00A0The woman he loves is Trinity. \u00A0Here\u2019s the scene from the original \u201CMatrix\u201D movie in which Neo first meets Morpheus, part prophet, part mystical leader who evokes Biblical figures from Moses to John the Baptist. Do you believe in fate, Neo? No. Why not? Because I don\u2019t like the idea that I\u2019m not in control of my life. Let me tell you why you\u2019re here. \u00A0You\u2019re here because you know something. \u00A0What you know you can\u2019t explain, but you feel it. \u00A0You\u2019ve felt it your entire life, that there\u2019s something wrong with the world. \u00A0You don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. \u00A0It is this feeling that has brought you to me. \u00A0Do you know what I am talking about? The matrix? Do you want to know what it is? \u00A0The matrix is everywhere. \u00A0It is all around us, even now in this very room. \u00A0You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. \u00A0You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. \u00A0It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. \u00A0Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. Again, religion observer Phyllis Tickle: Critic after critic has said there is nothing in \u201CThe Matrix\u201D that\u2019s for free. \u00A0Everything there cross-references to something else. And I guess I just want to probe at that some more. \u00A0I mean, what is it that makes this theological that you can, you know, mention Niebuhr in the same sentence that you call it a film about God. Probably where angels would fear to tread. Yeah, exactly, as opposed to fantasy. \u00A0What is it that\u2019s theological in there? It is not a fantasy, because it rests on a philosophic principle. \u00A0And then the philosophic, or socio-religious, or whatever principle is that we have no understanding of human consciousness. \u00A0And the great question that is going to inflict or inform, as the case may be, religion over the next 25 to 50 years is going to be the question of consciousness. \u00A0And that\u2019s really basically what \u201CMatrix\u201D is dealing with. \u00A0If you want to stop a gathering of the faithful dead, give everybody an index card and say, `Don\u2019t sign this, but you have five minutes to write the end of this sentence: \u00A0A soul is\u2026\u2019 And there\u2019s absolute quiet and a whole lot of blank index cards. \u00A0That is the great question facing the 21st century: \u00A0What is reality? \u00A0Now, it\u2019s not a new question, and men have answered it many times over the centuries and lived with their answers for three or 400 years, and then the answer kind of disappears and we redefine the answer. \u00A0Certainly Descartes. \u00A0Descartes said, `I think, and therefore I am.\u2019 That\u2019s no longer good enough in a computer age. So what \u201CMatrix\u201D is really\u2026 OK, because computers can think, too. Because computers can think, or they do something very close to it. \u00A0And what happens if they go one step farther into quantum and do, indeed, become thinking entities? \u00A0So this is not fantasy in the usual definition of that genre as a division of art. \u00A0What this really is, is an exploration of possibility. OK. \u00A0So, you\u2019ve convinced me that \u201CThe Matrix\u201D \u2014 and I have been a skeptic, I will confess \u2014 that \u201CThe Matrix\u201D communicates some very lofty, mystical, religious ideas. \u00A0I have wondered, though, why so many people, as you say, have pointed at \u201CThe Matrix\u201D and called it religious and there\u2019s not the same kind of attention to something like \u201CShrek,\u201D right? \u00A0The \u201CShrek\u201D movies. Isn\u2019t that interesting? Yeah, which are very much about lived virtue, right? Yes. \u00A0Now, the other one that comes immediately to mind as you speak \u2014 you know, Walden Media was founded, oh, what two years ago? \u00A0Three years ago now, I suppose. \u00A0Bill Bennett \u2014 William Bennett, \u201CBook of Virtues,\u201D Bennett is chairman of their board of advisers. \u00A0It was founded to do \u2014 well, they were careful in their wording \u2014 essentially what you and I would call faith-based movies. \u00A0And \u201CHoles\u201D was their first production. \u00A0Now, there\u2019s God-talk big-time. Yeah. And it didn\u2019t get the play that I thought I\u2026 Kids get that, I think. Well, kids do get that. \u00A0And \u201CHoles\u201D is so Old Testament it\u2019s incredible. \u00A0You know, you\u2019ve got this spot in Texas somewhere, out West anyway, where there has been great evil done, and God has cursed that until the evil can be undone. \u00A0And these poor children are put out there in a work camp as punishment for having done various and sundry petty crimes. \u00A0And in their kind of goodness, in almost their innocence \u2014 though they are little criminals \u2014 in their innocence they begin to believe, and they do, indeed, solve the crime that had happened. \u00A0\u201CHoles\u201D comes from the fact that they\u2019re in the business of just simply digging mindless holes all over this perfectly dry area and there\u2019s no point. \u00A0They\u2019re just doing it because that\u2019s their punishment. \u00A0And when they come to salvation, when they solve it, when the old lady blesses the children, then God moves and there is rain upon the face of the earth for the first time in 130 years. \u00A0And children do get that. Walden Media\u2019s official statement, as I read it, was that they wanted to write for children and for their parents with the understanding stated in there that this would be a teaching opportunity for parents. \u00A0That is, they\u2019re not trying to entertain the parents so much as they\u2019re trying to offer them something that will entertain the children and then give them basis for discussion about God and about values after the movies are over. \u00A0Well, that\u2019s a remarkable thing. \u00A0And I thought \u201CHoles\u201D was a superb piece of work, just as I thought \u201CSeven\u201D was a superb piece of work, or \u201CBruce Almighty.\u201D I mean, now there\u2019s one that\u2019s pure God-talk. Well, and it doesn\u2019t claim to be anything else. It doesn\u2019t claim to be anything else. \u00A0Morgan Freeman, who\u2026 And he\u2019s God in that movie. Well, God in that movie. \u00A0But he also is taking \u2014 and he was also, of course, the policeman in \u201CSeven\u201D with Brad Pitt. \u00A0He\u2019s taking his rather sizable, I\u2019d say, income or savings, and has founded a movie company called \u201CRevelations\u201D and is in the business of doing exactly what we\u2019re talking about, producing films \u2014 \u201CLevity,\u201D I think, is the first one. \u00A0I\u2019ve not seen it yet \u2014 producing films that will do this very thing, though they are not for children. \u00A0They are for adults with the understanding and the hope, anyway, that there will be conversation afterwards, that it will not only be an interior experience in which you ask yourself questions looking for answers, or at least for what you think the answer is, but also will be having conversation in a social setting with other people. \u00A0And, you know, Jerry Jenkins of \u201CLeft Behind\u201D fame has funded his son, Dallas Jenkins\u2026 I was just reading about that. Yes. He\u2019s making movies, isn\u2019t he? Yes. \u00A0And Dallas himself says, `You know, looking at \u201CLeft Behind\u201D on the screen is just not going to hack it. \u00A0It\u2019s too obvious. \u00A0And it\u2019s going to have to be more subtle and greater intellectual bread than \u2014 it\u2019s got to be more than that obvious.\u2019 I\u2019m tempted to ask a question like, you know, doesn\u2019t your theology allow for a God who also just likes a good, entertaining movie? You bet he does. \u00A0I\u2019m Episcopalian. \u00A0You know that. I mean, it\u2019s occurring to me that we can get too serious as even religious people who want to see morality and good messages in movies. Well, and let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s the other, too, that I have said many times when we get in these kind of heady conversations, if it is art, if it is honest to god, card-carrying, well done, well-crafted, well-honed art, it comes up so sweetly against the side of religion that they are essentially kissing each other. \u00A0You cannot separate art, even the Faustists, for heaven\u2019s sake, from religion if it\u2019s true art. \u00A0We can\u2019t escape the fact that somehow the religion is concerned with the subjective world, as is art. \u00A0And they share a territory that somehow circumvents or circumscribes the mind, and they have a conversation together. \u00A0So it\u2019s very hard to imagine that religion isn\u2019t a part of all really sound aesthetic experience. \u00A0But \u2014 and I\u2019m all for entertainment \u2014 I do think it would be impossible to see, for instance, \u201CThe Lord of the Rings\u201D without having some sense that there is, `Hmm, something going on here.\u2019 I wish the ring had never come to me. \u00A0I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. \u00A0All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. \u00A0There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides those of evil. \u00A0Bilbo was meant to find the ring, in which case you also were meant to have it, and that is an encouraging thought. A scene from the first movie in \u201CThe Lord of the Rings\u201D trilogy. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. My guest, Phyllis Tickle, has been an observer of religious themes in books and culture for many years as a religion editor of Publisher\u2019s Weekly. \u00A0She writes widely about what she calls \u201CGod-Talk in America.\u201D This hour we\u2019re exploring the expanding landscape of films with religious themes and images. The \u201CHarry Potter\u201D story both in book and movie form is explosively popular. But when \u201CHarry Potter\u201D first came out as a film, some conservative religious groups worried that its celebration of dark arts might be harmful to children. An interesting debate took place within Evangelical Christian media. \u00A0The ensuing years have produced a genre of Christian literature to describe and defend the theological messages in Hogwarts appealing world of magic. \u00A0Here\u2019s a scene from \u201CHarry Potter\u201D in which he\u2019s addressed by Hogwarts\u2019 venerable headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. \u00A0I trust by now you realize what it does. \u00A0Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself exactly as he is. So then it shows us what we want, whatever we want? Yes and no. \u00A0It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. \u00A0This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. \u00A0Men have wasted away in front of it. Let\u2019s say, all right, there\u2019s something in the \u201CHarry Potter\u201D movies that just delights me\u2026that I think of the big movies of my childhood. \u00A0I mean, the \u201CMary Poppins,\u201D \u201CThe Sound of Music.\u201D I don\u2019t know what \u2014\u00A0you know, \u201CChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201D \u2014 these great big movies that somehow now this new generation is getting great big wonderful Hollywood movies. And isn\u2019t it marvelous? And it\u2019s marvelous. \u00A0But then, you know, I\u2019m curious about your thoughts on how just stories work on us, which is also in sacred traditions. And let\u2019s say what is it in stories about witches and wizards that also taps into some symbols that are meaningful for us as human beings and don\u2019t need to be manipulated? Because we all live with them. \u00A0And, you know, Freud or Jung, they both had field days with this. \u00A0But there is the dark side and that dark side does have agencies. \u00A0And children are much more open to admitting that, indeed, magic happens. \u00A0They see things out of the corner of their eyes. \u00A0They recognize a thin spot when they\u2019re in it. \u00A0As we become adult, somehow our minds teach us to scorn those realities, and so we run around scared all the time. \u00A0We run around scared of our own sins, of what we can do. \u00A0We deny a devil while at the same time paying him the greatest homage of constantly trying to fend him off. \u00A0There\u2019s another thing that comes into play here, I think, and that\u2019s the Medievalism thing. \u00A0You mentioned \u201CMary Poppins,\u201D and I enjoyed \u201CMary Poppins\u201D with my children more than my children enjoyed \u201CMary Poppins.\u201D But it was a different era in which she came out. \u00A0\u201CHarry Potter\u201D comes out in a time when we are now aware once more that there is a huge dark side. \u00A0We are engaged in a real culture battle as well as an economic one. Everything is impinging upon us. \u00A0Computers themselves teach us that there\u2019s a world out there that we don\u2019t immediately see that\u2019s called nonlocative geography. \u00A0That is, there\u2019s a place that doesn\u2019t have the usual dimensions where we can shop and we can meet our friends. That\u2019s virtual reality, right? Well, if it \u2014 yes. \u00A0We would call it virtuality if it were not a form of reality. \u00A0\u201CMary Poppins\u201D and \u201CHarry Potter\u201D are the same story. \u00A0They deal with the same human need in children and the same kind of wisdom. They\u2019re told to two different eras in Western experience. \u00A0\u201CMary Poppins\u201D came in the days of Pax Americana, if you will, in a time when we were deep into rationalism, deep into enlightenment, deep into scientism. \u00A0\u201CHarry Potter\u201D comes at a time when we are definitely post-modern, we are post-enlightenment, we are post-rational. \u00A0And so we\u2019re going back to scratch around where last we left those wonderful vehicles. \u00A0We\u2019re talking about what we had all along, which was a subjective life that\u2019s as full of darkness as it is full of light. God-Talk in America author Phyllis Tickle. \u00A0This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, more of Phyllis Tickle on how new generations of Americans distinctly experience religious questions and their expression in popular culture. \u00A0We\u2019ll also hear from Lynn Schofield Clark on how this is showing up on television. On our Web site at speakingoffaith.org, you\u2019ll find in-depth background, reading recommendations, and information about purchasing a copy of this program. \u00A0You can also sign up for our weekly e-mail newsletter, which includes program transcripts and my reflections on each week\u2019s program. That\u2019s speakingoffaith.org. \u00A0I\u2019m Krista Tippett. \u00A0Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. \u00A0I\u2019m Krista Tippett. \u00A0Each week we take on a different theme, asking how religious ideas find expression in American life. Today, A Return to the Mystery: \u00A0Religion, Fantasy and Entertainment. My guest, Phyllis Tickle, is a veteran observer of religion in books and popular culture. \u00A0For many years she was a religion editor at large for Publisher\u2019s Weekly. We\u2019re talking about the explosion of religious themes in American movies that was growing long before Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201CPassion of the Christ.\u201D Phyllis Tickle says that subtle and inviting spiritual messages underpin the magic of popular films from \u201CThe Matrix\u201D to \u201CLord of the Rings.\u201D \u201CHarry Potter,\u201D she says, is the \u201CMary Poppins\u201D for a new generation. I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you. All right, I\u2019ll do it myself. Do what? Bit of magic. A bit of magic? It\u2019s easy. \u00A0Let\u2019s see. \u00A0You think, you wink, you do a double blink, you close your eyes and jump! Mary Poppins and Bert, the chimney sweep, take the children through a chalk drawing on a city sidewalk. \u00A0Today\u2019s cinematic heroes move through the mainframe. \u00A0Both challenge the bounds of space and time. \u00A0Phyllis Tickle says that today\u2019s children and teen-agers pose religious questions differently in part because they\u2019re growing up with computers. \u00A0Virtual reality lends a new credence to magic and mystery. \u00A0She also says that their questions and fears are very different from generations that came before. \u00A0On the one hand, in a world of great insecurity, younger Americans are returning to grand Medieval themes of good and evil. \u00A0At the same time they are comfortable with post-modern mysticism, irrationality, and a questioning approach to the nature of consciousness itself. One of the great differences, of course, is that they think relationally. \u00A0And, in fact, there are always generation gaps, and it\u2019s, again, a little simplistic to talk about generational gaps. \u00A0But there was not a gap between the boomers and their kids, the X-ers, there was an abyss. \u00A0There is a crevasse between the people who were born before \u201980 and those who have been born since, and especially \u201985, where the computer itself has allowed relational thinking to happen. \u00A0That is, they connect instead of thinking linearly. \u00A0And people who were born prior to 1980 still think linearly. \u00A0You can\u2019t avoid it. \u00A0You go Roman numeral I, and Roman numeral IA, Roman numeral 1A, Arabic I, and you go down that way. \u00A0Whereas people, young people who have grown up on a computer and never known any other way think as the computer does, which is in hyperlinks. \u00A0I have a Native American friend who says, you know, what they think in is in terms of spider webs, and if you pluck the spider web here it resonates everywhere and all things are connected. \u00A0So that\u2026 Which is also what physics is telling us these days. Of course it is. \u00A0It\u2019s exactly what physics is telling us, you know? \u00A0It\u2019s good quantum physics. \u00A0When the butterfly bats its wings in Brazil, all of the world feels its current. \u00A0But that kind of associational thinking, if you will. It also doesn\u2019t ask a point, if you will. \u00A0It doesn\u2019t have to arrive at a conclusion because after you finish Roman I and Roman II you don\u2019t have to get to, `Therefore, I have proved this thing.\u2019 It is sufficient that it resonated with other pieces of truth. \u00A0So there\u2019s not the drive to resolution. \u00A0And there is a huge drive to bring in or to be sure that the whole corpus of associations is touched. \u00A0That is, every hyperlink \u2014 it\u2019s as if Google has infected all of our heads, that every idea is no good unless it sort of resonates will all of the related ideas around it, and they need to all flash on that screen. \u00A0And \u201CMatrix\u201D is a beautiful example of that kind of relational thinking in which every hyperlink that could be made is made and set to flashing, more or less symbolically, on the screen. Cultural critic Phyllis Tickle. \u00A0Here\u2019s a scene from the second \u201CMatrix\u201D movie, \u201CMatrix Reloaded,\u201D where the story\u2019s savior, Neo, is advised by the Oracle, an omniscient cookie-baking, chain-smoking prophet. We\u2019re all here to do what we\u2019re all here to do. \u00A0Look, see those birds? \u00A0At some point a program was written to govern them. \u00A0A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind, sunrise and sunset. \u00A0There are programs running all over the place. \u00A0The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. \u00A0You\u2019d never even know they were here. But the other ones, well, you hear about them all the time. I\u2019ve never heard of them. Of course you have. \u00A0Every time you\u2019ve heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel. \u00A0Every story you\u2019ve ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens is the system assimilating some program that\u2019s doing something they\u2019re not supposed to be doing. \u00A0Usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion, and when it does, a program can either choose to hide here or return to the source. There is such in young people now \u2014 and since I\u2019m 70 I call young anything under 50, but theoretically anything under 45 anyway \u2014 there is the push back to the ancient. Right. \u00A0Where does that come from? Yes. \u00A0Yes. What\u2019s that? It\u2019s a rebellion against so much intellectuality, so much head, so much rationalism, and so much consumerism, so much corruption of the body\u2019s ability to feel and perceive and experience through overmentation and over-consumer goods and over-packaging, so that there is no reality in our reality. \u00A0It\u2019s disgusting. \u00A0And there is the drift back to the time when the ancients knew and understood, when there could be conjuring, when they could have concourse with the spirits, when there was time to invite whatever it is that\u2019s beyond my consciousness to come in, or to slip out of my consciousness and commune with it. \u00A0That pullback \u2014 I have a friend who says we\u2019re rapidly hasting toward the third century, and she\u2019s absolutely right. \u00A0You see the rise in liturgical worship, in smells and bells. \u00A0I\u2019m fascinated by the return to fasting. \u00A0Who\u2019d have thunk it? \u00A0I bet you I have 12 or 15 books coming out on fasting. \u00A0I\u2019m not talking about dieting. That you see coming through Publisher\u2019s Weekly, or that you\u2026 Yes. \u00A0It\u2019s all part and parcel of something new. \u00A0And whatever the new is, it sure is post-reformation. \u00A0The questions the reformation asked and the enlightenment tried to answer, and rationalism tried to answer, they\u2019ve all been answered. \u00A0They don\u2019t matter anymore. \u00A0But wherever it is that we are, we\u2019re entering a new era of human history, certainly of Western history. \u00A0It\u2019s a return to the mystery. Phyllis Tickle is a lecturer and author on religion and spirituality in America. \u00A0Her books include \u201CThe Shaping of a Life: \u00A0A Religious Landscape.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. \u00A0Today, \u201CA Return to the Mystery: \u00A0Religion, Fantasy and Entertainment.\u201D This is the theme music from \u201CJoan of Arcadia,\u201D the newest and maybe the hottest in a long line of recent programs on American television aimed at young people and filled with religious images. \u00A0One of Joan\u2019s television predecessors, \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201D was a teen-age girl locked in a battle of good vs. evil while comfortably embedded in middle-class America. That may sound more like a horror story than a religious one, but as the series ended in 2003 after seven years, theologians wrote a spade of books on Buffy\u2019s religious meaning. \u00A0Half seriously, some proposed a new moral motto for America\u2019s youth: \u00A0the question, `What would Buffy do?\u2019 My next guest, Lynn Schofield Clark, is a professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Journalism and Mass Communication. \u00A0A former television producer and marketer, she\u2019s conducted extensive research on teen-agers and new media. \u00A0She\u2019s interviewed teens from conservative and liberal, religious and nonreligious backgrounds, and written a book called From Angels to Aliens: \u00A0Teen-agers, the Media and the Supernatural. She says that spiritual themes have a strong appeal as teen-agers struggle to form their identities. And before she studies the effect of media on teen-agers\u2019 spiritual lives, she lays out the core question she hears them asking. `What is my life going to be about? \u00A0You know, who am I going to be, and what kind of decisions will I make that will move me toward being part of something bigger than myself? \u00A0Who can I trust, and who will be my allies in my life as I go along? \u00A0And how will I relate to the adults in my life, and how can I find adults in my life who can actually provide the support that I feel I need in order to become who I want to be?\u2019 Lynn Schofield Clark is well aware that adults, especially parents, worry about entertainment providing their children with answers to those kinds of critical questions. \u00A0Echoing Phyllis Tickle, she says young people may be getting their deepest religious inspiration in places their parents aren\u2019t always looking, the realm of fantasy. What I\u2019m interested in in particular is looking at fantasy that also appeals to teens because I think that the fantasies reveal what\u2019s still lacking from that primary message of the media. \u00A0And when I look at things like \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D or \u201CJoan of Arcadia\u201D or Neo from \u201CThe Matrix\u201D or Frodo from \u201CLord of the Rings,\u201D at the center of each story is a young person who has a sense of purpose or a sense of chosenness. \u00A0And they also have a set of trusted allies, or friends, in the battle of good vs. evil. And you\u2019ll also see that there\u2019s some intervention from caring adults. \u00A0So it\u2019s not that adults are completely absent from the picture, but they have a very particular kind of a role, an authority and a respect that have to be earned from the eyes of the young person. \u00A0And so when I look at those stories, I think that I have a lot more hope, I guess, for young people because, you know, I think that they really do want to do something with their lives that\u2019s meaningful. \u00A0It\u2019s just a matter of trying to figure out how to sort out their own options to get there. You know, I\u2019m wondering how different kinds of programming are appealing to different kinds of teen-agers, or is there that kind of divide? Definitely I found that people who like \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D generally didn\u2019t like \u201CTouched by an Angel\u201D or \u201CJoan of Arcadia.\u201D You know, so there\u2019s a real split there. \u00A0Either you\u2019re interested in the supernatural and kind of like the idea and you\u2019re kind of intrigued with it, or you see it as kind of with a broad brush and think, `Well, that\u2019s all evil.\u2019 And so some people would talk about things like \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D as Satanic, some of the more conservative teens. \u00A0Some were even concerned that \u201CThe Simpsons\u201D might be Satanic because it was \u2014 I actually heard one teen say that \u2014 because they were uncomfortable with the irreverence in the program whereas other teens like the irreverence and felt that that was something that enabled them to deal with their own faith commitments in a way that took seriously their faith without taking the institutions very seriously. I wonder if it\u2019s possible at all to generalize about what kinds of themes of morality young people are getting out of these. \u00A0And maybe you have to separate them into different categories. \u00A0I don\u2019t know. \u00A0I mean, maybe the angels and the aliens really can\u2019t be considered together, but are coming at young people and what are they taking in? \u00A0What have you learned about that in your studies? Well, I think one of the things that stands out to me right away is that evil is something that\u2019s writ large, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of interesting. \u00A0Because I think when we talk about morality and television or film, a lot of times religious leaders and other teachers and people who work with young people tend to focus on personal morality, you know, personal decisions about whether or not, you know, drinking and premarital sex, and those kinds of things, which are also, of course, important and part of young people\u2019s everyday lives and they need guidance in those things. \u00A0But I think when we look at the stories of fantasy that we\u2019ve been talking about, it\u2019s really clear that evil comes across as a problem and something that\u2019s quite large, something that is not easily overcome in one\u2019s everyday life or in one person\u2019s life. \u00A0But you do need the support \u2014 a friendship circle who can help you with your own struggles of good vs. evil, and you need the interventions of caring adults who will help you to provide some guidance and mentorship along the way. It seems to me that there may be a new movement at the moment of entertainment and cultural products that are aimed at young people and that have a more explicitly religious message. \u00A0So I\u2019m thinking of this television series \u201CJoan of Arcadia,\u201D for example. I think of \u201CJoan of Arcadia\u201D as kind of \u201CTouched by an Angel\u201D meets \u201CMy So-Called Life.\u201D The story of it is that Joan is an average teen-ager to whom God appears in various guises. \u00A0So sometimes God will look like a teen-age boy, sometimes it\u2019s the lunch lady, sometimes it\u2019s an older art teacher \u2014 you know, various races, various kind of looks and ages. \u00A0And through these various people that appear to Joan, God then speaks to Joan and tells her what to do. Here\u2019s a scene from \u201CJoan of Arcadia\u201D in which God has appeared as a fellow student in a cosmetics class dressed in high Goth clothing. Look into the mirror, Joan, and what do you see? Some ridiculous, vain girl who can\u2019t stop thinking about shading and concealing. \u00A0This is just not who I am. Exactly. So I\u2019m just supposed to reject all this stuff, that\u2019s the point? The interesting thing is that in this storyline God is never really very predictable, and it\u2019s never clear exactly what it is that\u2019s going to be the outcome of what he\u2019s asking her to do. \u00A0And we don\u2019t always see, even at the end of the particular episode, why it is that she had to take that particular path, do something. \u00A0But we know that there\u2019s kind of a larger purpose involved. \u00A0She has an older brother who was injured in an accident, and so he\u2019s paralyzed from the waist down. \u00A0And she often will ask God \u2014 these God characters \u2014 why it is that he just can\u2019t heal her brother. \u00A0And God has responded to her that God doesn\u2019t answer the \u201Cwhy\u201D questions. You know, it\u2019s important to remember that this program is part of kind of the first series of television programs that came out after 9/11. \u00A0And so in some ways I think that the fact that it is a hopeful program and one in which it acknowledges the fact that we can\u2019t always know God\u2019s plan in the world is part of that response to 9/11. \u00A0And then the sense in which we want \u2014 I think that audiences want to see teen-agers who even though they don\u2019t know the answers they feel comforted that God is there in their lives. Does this reflect a more explicitly religious interest? \u00A0Or does it represent popular culture imagining that, trying to appeal to something like that? I think clearly \u201CJoan of Arcadia\u201D hits the right tone, but there have been a lot of shows that haven\u2019t, you know? \u00A0I mean, you think about \u201CNothing\u2019s Sacred\u201D a couple of years ago, which was the ABC program. I don\u2019t remember that one. You don\u2019t even remember it? No. Yeah, and there was a program that I can\u2019t remember the name of now, where Dan Aykroyd was like an Episcopal priest, I think. \u00A0So there have been a lot of programs over the past couple of years even that just haven\u2019t found an audience. \u00A0But I do think that in some ways \u201CTouched by an Angel\u201D opened up the sense that, `Oh, people can take religion seriously and are interested in religion.\u2019 And at the same time, coincidentally, \u201CBuffy\u201D and \u201CThe X-Files,\u201D I think, were opening up the possibility that the supernatural can be taken less seriously and also mixed with some more traditional questioning in religion. \u00A0And so I think that\u2019s it\u2019s been a really viable way that has entered lots of different genres in popular culture, from music to films and television programs to video games. And if I think of those three you just mentioned, \u201CThe X-Files,\u201D \u201CJoan of Arcadia\u201D and \u201CBuffy,\u201D even when there are explicitly religious kinds of messages, spiritual kinds of messages, there\u2019s absolutely nothing sectarian about them, right? \u00A0Is that why they can have a wide appeal, why they\u2019re hitting the right tone? Yeah. \u00A0I think that\u2019s an important part of hitting the right tone, and that\u2019s something that is always interesting to look at, is how religion is encoded in such a way that it can seem general enough for everybody, and yet, you know, and not specific enough that it\u2019s going to offend anybody. \u00A0Because that means they\u2019ll tune out. But they do get at big, burning questions at their best, all of those. Right. \u00A0Yeah, and I think that\u2019s what media can do. \u00A0I mean, they can really raise the interesting questions and leave people in a place where they feel like they can make the decisions and figure out how they want to respond. Teens and media researcher Lynn Schofield Clark. \u00A0This is Speaking of Faith, and I\u2019m Krista Tippett from American Public Media. Today, we\u2019re exploring how religious themes surface in movies and television and what they say about the spiritual sensibility of younger generations. In a pivotal scene of the series finale of the television series \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201D this music, a rendition of the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, sung by popular artist Sarah McLachlan, played in the background. \u00A0This was a surprising choice even for \u201CBuffy\u201D aficionados. \u00A0But Lynn Schofield Clark says it is an expression of the ancient religious messages of current media fantasies. \u00A0As she put it, \u201CEvil writ large runs throughout the most popular series on television and in film, as it does in the world teenagers experience. \u00A0But there\u2019s always another side to that story, that of good writ large.\u201D You know, certainly Joss Whedon, who wrote \u201CBuffy,\u201D you know, certainly wouldn\u2019t be interested in anything like trying to proselytize, but I think that there is sort of an unconscious association between good and the way that it\u2019s been coded in ancient religious traditions. It\u2019s very interesting, isn\u2019t it? It was. \u00A0I was really shocked when that song played. Yeah. And it fit very well, I mean, because it\u2019s a story about the apocalypse, and, you know, it always has been. \u00A0So it sort of made sense that the last episode of that series would be apocalyptic and also would kind of be reassuring at the same time that good will triumph. So, if I ask you the large question then, how is this mix of fantasy and spirituality and popular shaping our children spiritually, what are your thoughts on that? Well, I think that the main thing that occurs to me when we talk about kind of the summative stories is to think about how they see religion in relation to possibility. \u00A0You know, on the one hand that there are possibilities about what can exist, and they are aware that there are questions that cannot be answered either by religion or by science, and that they\u2019re intrigued by those questions. \u00A0And the media play with those questions, I think, too, by presenting possibilities. \u00A0You know, what if there are angels? \u00A0What if there is an ability to talk with people beyond this life? And this is taking place in the context in which religious stories, for a lot of people, are becoming less definitive or less authoritative. You mean religious stories passed down by traditions? Right. \u00A0Yeah, the religious stories passed down by traditions, for some young people anyway. \u00A0So I think what I would say is that it\u2019s not that the fantasy stories have become more important, it\u2019s that the religious stories have become less so. \u00A0And I think that that\u2019s probably an interesting opening, I guess, for traditional religion as well because in some ways those stories have maybe not been of great interest to traditional religious organizations that have wanted to place a great emphasis on personal morality. Right. But I think it\u2019s something that could be kind of, you know, an interesting thing to look at. Lynn Schofield Clark is associate professor at the University of Colorado. \u00A0Her books include From Angels to Aliens: \u00A0Teen-agers, the Media and the Supernatural. Earlier in this hour you heard cultural observer Phyllis Tickle, author of \u201CGod-Talk in America.\u201D It\u2019s easy for religious and nonreligious people alike to scoff at spirituality as popular entertainment. \u00A0\u201CThe Matrix\u201D or \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D might well seem distortions of religious ideas rather than carriers of meaning for a new generation. \u00A0Phyllis Tickle offers a fascinating observation that by way of virtual reality young people are rediscovering the notion of mystery. Perhaps most challenging in this program is Lynn Schofield Clark\u2019s suggestion that today\u2019s fantasy stories are more important because religious stories have not been passed on. \u00A0But both she and Phyllis Tickle find a generous measure of good in them that can be an opening for parents and religious institutions alike. \u00A0In that spirit, we\u2019ll close by listening on advice the elf, Galadriel, gives to young Frodo in \u201CLord of the Rings.\u201D This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way no one will. Then I know what I must do, it\u2019s just I\u2019m afraid to do it. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
