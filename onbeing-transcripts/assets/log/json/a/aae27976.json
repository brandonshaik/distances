  "fullText": "I just want to actually read some very beautiful words that you wrote about time and memory. \u201CTime is, of course, doing it\u2019s steady work on every object ever made. This complex relationship between the maker, and emotionally-invested objects, and the growing distance between them is not new, only rediscovered each generation,\u201D \u2014 I love this \u2014 \u201Cwhether by an artist, a mourner, a mother, or a soldier.\u201D Later you say, you know, that you have to let go, right? Loss is about letting go. \u201CBut that we let go with the hope that others will grab hold. These objects ask very human moral questions. What right do we have to forget? What do we owe to each other\u2019s memories?\u201D So memory now takes on a moral dimension, because when I go, I\u2019ll hope someone grabs hold of me. But I have to promise I\u2019m grabbing hold of who\u2019s gone before. Like, my grandmother who I was deeply close to. I remember her, deeply, every day. And when I go probably no one\u2019s going to remember in that way again. So I\u2019m going to hold on. I\u2019m going to grasp, pull hard into the last moment. I like that art can do that. And I think it should. It should do that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with the artist Dario Robleto \u2014 on how objects \u2014 in life and in culture \u2014 can become meditations on war, love, time, and healing. This Texas-based \u201Cmaterialist poet\u201D is famous for spinning and shaping unconventional materials \u2014 from meteorite remnants to pulverized vintage records, from swamp root to cramp bark. He joins words, ideas, and objects in a way that distills meaning at once social, poetic, and scientific. His projects\u2019 evocative titles capture some of this: \u201CHeaven is Being a Memory to Others,\u201D or the \u201CSadness Silence Can\u2019t Touch.\u201DIn person, Dario Robleto is a gently charismatic presence. Curator Elizabeth Armstrong introduced him at our live conversation at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts as a \u201Ca passionate alchemist who memorializes the past while finding new meaning in the tangled roots of its history.\u201D Dario Robleto was born in 1972 in San Antonio, Texas. It\u2019s great to be back at Minneapolis Institute of Arts. I feel like I\u2019m an old-timer now, so I welcome you. Well, thank you. So, Dario, you grew up in San Antonio? Yes. I grew up in Oklahoma. It did not snow in March where we came from. No. I\u2019ve really been looking forward to this for several months, as we first planned it. Thank you. Me, too. Very much. Yeah. So, if I ask you about the spiritual and religious background of your childhood, where would you start to think about what that means? My grandfather was a Baptist minister. I didn\u2019t grow up around him so much, but his influence definitely was there, in the back of my head. And he was definitely a passionate man. My mother \u2014 religion in the home was not ever really an issue, but as, with anyone, I searched it out on my own. I\u2019d ask my friends if I could come to church: Catholic, Methodist, I probably sampled every church of a friend I had. So in my childhood, I would say it was very self-directed. Maybe always within the background knowing that thing about my grandfather that was still this kind of mysterious thing that I didn\u2019t really understand. So maybe it was partly fueled by that, too. This searching. It sounds like, you know, you were interested in science, you were a football player. You weren\u2019t that kid who everybody thought would grow up to be an artist. No. Right? Or that you didn\u2019t think that about yourself. No, I didn\u2019t, no. No. It was quite a shock. Yeah. You know there are two stories that you\u2019ve told, um, across the years that I wondered if you would, like, tell us. And one of them has to do with your mother, one of them has to do with your father. About how you became an artist. You talk about your mother working in a honky-tonk in Texas for a while when you were pretty young, and going with her. And it really is the whole experience, being there with her, taking in the people, taking in the life in that place, taking in the music of Patsy Cline and others, and listening to the jukebox. And it almost feels like the jukebox was your first art object, although you wouldn\u2019t have called it that originally. Yes. Incredibly influential on my life, definitely leaves a mark. So how old were you then? You were pretty young, right? Yeah. Six \u2014 six, seven. And, there are a full range of emotional experiences, you would imagine, in a honky-tonk. As a six-year-old camped next to the jukebox watching it play out, it really did leave a mark. And what I mean is, you know, having Patsy Cline soundtrack what I\u2019m actually witnessing in the room as she\u2019s singing about it, made this one-to-one connection between the pop song, or the country song, or the art object, and life. And I think that has left a lasting impression on me, which ties into science in maybe an unexpected way in that I want what I do to be metaphor and have a practical \u2014 I want it to do something, too, in life. Mm-hmm. And then the other stories, later on, your father was a biologist, correct? And\u2026 Mm-hmm. And was from Nicaragua. And you didn\u2019t really spend that much time with him growing up? No. But then, um, you\u2019ve told the story about, sounds like when you were maybe in your early 20s, you were depressed, and you went to stay with him in Miami. And we have the Beatles to thank Your father and the Beatles to thank for you truly having this epiphany. Yes. No, I really, I didn\u2019t know what an epiphany was until I had one. It really was that. I mean, within 24 hours. I still don\u2019t know how to explain it. It was related to this experience of what was clearly deep depression. Now, when I look back, visiting him, sort of \u2014 you know, every young man has to sort of come to terms with that at some point. And I just \u2014 I guess I needed to spend time with him. And really the only thing we could communicate on was music. And he was a huge Beatles fan. He pretty much learned English many \u2014 and his brothers, from Beatles records, I love that story that he told me \u2014 from the lyrics. But I don\u2019t know. One day he left and accidentally left \u201CSgt. Pepper\u201D playing on repeat on the CD. And I was, you know, locked in my room in some terrible state, and so for 24 hours I heard \u201CSgt. Pepper\u201D through the muffled wall in the other room. And something just changed. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. But when I came out of the room, I was an artist. And, I haven\u2019t looked back since. And you\u2019ve said that \u2014 I mean, you did bring out some pastels and a pad of paper? Right? And you started\u2026 Yeah, the first thing I told him was, please take me to an art store. Oh, you did. You didn\u2019t happen to have \u2014 I wondered about that. You didn\u2019t have pastels on hand. No, no. And that shows you, too, that I didn\u2019t know what it meant to be an artist, so I thought, well, pastels, or paper? I didn\u2019t even know what I needed. So, that was where I started. And I\u2019ll never forget that. Every artist has it, that blank page, and the fear, this guttural fear in my stomach, like oh, my God, anything\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know what to do. I was scared and drawn to it in the same way. And I still have that feeling. It never goes away, I realize that now. So it\u2019s interesting that both of these stories have music in them. Music is absolutely central to them. And, there\u2019s a kinship in you, a kinship with the DJ, and the idea of the DJ runs all the way through a lot of the art projects you\u2019ve done over the years. Yes. It\u2019s \u2014 for me to begin to talk about \u201Cthe sacred,\u201D I have to start with music. And, you know, oddly, I never learned how to play an instrument, and I always \u2014 I mean, one of my great \u2014 one of the things I\u2019m so envious of to this day is being in a band. And I\u2019ve never been in a band. And I wish so much I had been, and could have been, and even to this day, I \u2014 since I was a little boy, to this day, I\u2019ve kept a journal of potential band names and song titles. Really? Just in case I ever got in a band. That \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t play an instrument, I could contribute a great band name right away. And that\u2019s turned into its own art object over the years. I found ways to finally get those things out without the music. But, yeah, it\u2019s just part of, I don\u2019t know, the science part of my brain wonders what \u2014 how am I wired to lean this way? Yeah, and actually though, some of your earliest sculptures were made from grinding vinyl records. Mm-hmm. You know, like how do you take the actual skills of the DJ \u2014 song selections, sampling, scratching, beat matching, just all these things a DJ would do. So very simply, for example, the idea of mixing two records together. I thought, well what if I really melted them in a pot and mixed them together? And what would happen? Why did I choose those two songs? And then, DJs already handle the vinyl as an object as much as an audio experience. So I just kind of took that to an extreme. Like, what if you kept scratching your record until it turned to dust? Like I kept giving myself these kinds of challenges. Mm-hmm. So, you know, there\u2019s a phrase \u2014 there\u2019s some phrasing that I really appreciate now of the citizen scientist, and this is also language you use, because you work with science. The citizen artist. And so, as I was, you know, preparing to talk to you, I felt like, you know, you\u2019re kind of a DJ/artist, but I really also think you are an artist philosopher. And I think that\u2019s how I want to draw you out tonight. You know, you deal in all your work either directly or indirectly with the big subjects, you know, life, love, death. Mm-hmm. Yes. Somebody wrote about you, \u201CDario Robleto is a resurrector of dead things.\u201D Mm-hmm. Yeah, that\u2019s a compliment, yeah. Yeah. And you \u2014 but what you don\u2019t do, and I can imagine that people might think this when they hear about your work \u2014 it\u2019s not about found objects. It\u2019s about, as you say, alchemy. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s a great distinction. It\u2019s about the transformation. It\u2019s about what was hidden inside of it that only the artist\u2019s touch could have teased out through alteration. And that\u2019s alchemy 101 probably. And I like thinking of myself in that lineage, that through transformation of materials that there are other things at stake in the transformation, some of it being spiritual, even. Mm-hmm. And some of it being just chemical, right? Yeah, I\u2019m interested in\u2026 That gets at the scientist in you, as well. Yeah, no, I\u2019m interested in the molecule, up to the spiritual and everything in between in the material. But also the language of what the material was. Which is why I use this term, materialist poet. That I \u2014 I always try to\u2026 To describe your work. Yeah. I always try to emphasize the role of language in this process, because for an object maker, it\u2019s a little backwards in that the language often comes first, rather than the object comes first and then the language. So, often, I write my title, my material list is completely worked out before I ever start the object. Somewhere, I think this was part of \u2014 I looked at so much and I didn\u2019t keep good notes about where it came from \u2014 but this was on a website that was about one of your exhibitions. And it said that you ask yourself questions, jot down instructions or toy with a poetic phrase, which is what you just described for us. And that here\u2019s a to-do list that you\u2019d culled from challenges you\u2019ve presented to yourself across the years. Do you remember this list? I do. I mean, I\u2019m just going to read a few of them. There are 20 questions \u2014 questions or wonderings, I\u2019d say. You know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of how Einstein said that, you know \u2014 I mean, his science was all about pursuing wondering. Right? So, like, here you said, \u201Cculture dormant bacteria from grooves of mother\u2019s rock and roll records.\u201D That\u2019s just really an enduring theme. And I did do that, by the way. Yeah. You did? \u201CNumber six, how do I change the sound of the ocean?\u201D Mm-hmm. Still working on that. Okay. \u201CHow do I reunite a million-year-old rain drop with a million-year-old blossom?\u201D I did do that. Did you? I did. How did you find a million-year-old rain drop? Yeah, so this is where only language could have gotten me there, and then I have to figure out \u2014 because I just wrote that down. So you write the question, and then you have to pursue the question. Yeah. And I have to pursue, is this possible? Does such a thing exist? If it does, where is it? Can I get it? So, yeah, so for example, a million-year-old blossoms exist, uh, trapped in amber, for example. Right. You know, it rained tens of thousands of millions of years ago. A particular rain drop got caught just in the right moment when some sap was coming out of a tree. And before it had a chance to evaporate, another layer of sap formed a perfect air pocket over it. Oh, that is amazing. And there it is, a preserved rain drop from another time. And these things exist in the world, and I didn\u2019t know that until I had just poetically challenged myself, as language. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the sculptural artist and \u201Cmaterialist poet\u201D Dario Robleto, in a public event at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. It\u2019s very hard to talk about art on the radio. You know? Or even in a room where we\u2019re not looking at something. But for example, a project you had called \u201CA Sadness Silence Can\u2019t Touch.\u201D A small memento box containing six Civil War pain bullets, which were the bullets that soldiers bit on when they were undergoing surgery before the era of painkillers. Made \u2014 so what were the\u2026? You tell that. They were made from\u2026 This is a piece that language was being used as a material. And the role of the war poet \u2014 so the war poet\u2019s voice is this vital memory of a thoughtful, reflective mind in the most worst-case scenario of what we can produce on the planet. And those voices are really important. So those pain bullets are made \u2014 each one is made from a different recording of a war poet from different wars. So, these were audio tapes, cassette tapes? Yeah it was audio tape\u2026 Melted down\u2026 It was melted down and then made into \u2014 I cast the original pain bullet. So the pain bullets, they have marks of soldiers\u2019 teeth in them. Everybody knows that term, \u201Cbite the bullet.\u201D This is where it originates, which we\u2019ve lost the context with that history. But, it has a much darker background, which is, they\u2019re literally biting on a piece of lead more than likely as an amputation is occurring. And, so those marks, as a person sensitive to materials and form, when I see a tooth mark in a chunk of lead that\u2019s been buried in the ground for 150 years, it\u2019s as deeply moving to me as anything I\u2019ve ever seen. But as a form, a forgotten form of memory, I wanted to cast it, and remake it in the \u2014 what I think is the power of the poet\u2019s voice. And all of these poems, I should say, were chosen because they were forms of protest by the poet. And it was\u2026 Who was on the front line. \u2026Walt Whitman, Tennyson, T.S. Eliot, Robert Graves, Dylan Thomas. Yes. Siegfried Sassoon, I believe. Yes, Sassoon. Yeah, who were all in some way, they were speaking to the gruesomeness of it, which can\u2019t ever be forgotten or lost. I imagined the poets, the force of their voice moving their mouth, moving their teeth, and making new impressions into the bullet. But they\u2019re impressions of protest, rather than the original impression made from pain of an amputation, for example. So, it was very specific, why I chose language in the form that was made by the mouth. And that also gets at something that is so evocative that you talk about, also as your work as an artist, of healing back through time. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 I mean, which is an amazing thing for any of us to think about. At least for me as an artist, my point about, I don\u2019t think I have the right to forget certain things. That I think it\u2019s a luxury of our time that should be pressed harder against. Every generation of warriors comments on the gulf they feel when they come back. So, could I at least try to heal that divide? And so that\u2019s more of a metaphorical divide, but it\u2019s also a real direct psychological \u2014 it could have real-world consequence if you could initiate a conversation of \u2014 between the home front and front line. So, the healing thing takes on many forms in my work. How did you get interested in war? You know, you are not really of a generation \u2014 you kind of missed the Vietnam War, you were born in 1972. I mean, of course you live in this post-9/11 world, but I\u2019m just curious about this\u2026 It was 9/11. \u2026intensity. It was 9/11? Yeah, it was absolutely 9/11. And then that also took you back to Civil War and World War I. Yeah. No, I tend \u2014 when I get involved in a project, I go all in. And I, you know, I thought \u2014 you know, if everybody remembers what was the big question in the moment, it was why? Why us? There was this complete confusion about how? Why? And I was like everybody else, I was like I realized I didn\u2019t have a good answer. Were you in Houston at that time? San Antonio. And, I was so frustrated with myself that I couldn\u2019t answer that question. So I decided, I\u2019m going to make work \u2014 as long as the country was at war, I thought, okay, I\u2019m going to make work in response to it, because I was grappling with this, what\u2019s the artist responsibility in a time of war? Of course, nobody knew we were entering the longest war in our history. And so, a decade later, I was still making work about the war. But I think what\u2019s important about that is, you know, the news cycle \u2014 yes we\u2019ve been at war all this time in some sense \u2014 but the news cycle moves on. But you\u2019ve actually, as an artist, you\u2019ve continued to hold that reality. And also I think the fact that you\u2019re doing it in a spirit of a question, can you heal back through time? Yeah. No, it \u2014 the idea of a sustained meditation on a problem, you know, seems like this format quickly going out of style. So, that takes on another dimension in our time of trying to go against the grain of immediate gratification or short-term memory, short-term attention spans, which, you know, have \u2014 many artists have used that in brilliant creative ways in their work. And, you need the sustained meditation \u2014 you need those voices on certain problems. Yes, in that mix. Yeah, and you need artists on the front line, in a sense, with the other people in other fields who are also not losing their attention to this problem. I really believe that. So, I tend to latch on to a topic for many years when I commit to something. And it\u2019s interesting because you \u2014 you reflect sometimes about being part of your generation. I don\u2019t know, are you a Gen X? Is that\u2026? Yeah. Yeah. Gen X, mm-hmm. Yeah, I get \u2014 I can\u2019t keep track anymore. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re on. What letter are we on? Yeah, I don\u2019t know what letter we\u2019re at. But you\u2019re right. The stereotype of Gen X is not too deep, cynical. Yes, it just drove me crazy. Yeah. That I was being lumped in with this apolitical, apathetic, cynical, overly-ironic generation, which was all true\u2026 Also lazy is, I think, is the stereotype. Yeah. And certainly that was there, but\u2026 It\u2019s not the whole story. Yeah, no, and no generation is all that. And I really wanted to push back against that. I mean, you pushed back against it, just in by being who you are. I really appreciate you said, \u201CI assume that my viewers are smart and want to engage.\u201D Again, that\u2019s kind of a countercultural statement. We\u2019re comrades in this. Yes. Assuming the best of our audiences. Yes. I like assuming the audience is smart when pretty much everywhere else in culture, I think they think we\u2019re stupid. I\u2019d rather assume the opposite. Because that actually changes decisions I make in the studio. It has a studio value in how I make an object. Mm-hmm. Say some more. Well, in that the layers of meaning in my work that I purposefully put there hoping that if someone were to want to continue through those layers that I promise there\u2019d be something interesting. You don\u2019t have to go, but the door\u2019s open. I just want to actually read some very beautiful words that you wrote about time and memory. This subject. This long view of time you have. \u201CTime is, of course, doing it\u2019s steady work on every object ever made. This complex relationship between the maker, and emotionally-invested objects, and the growing distance between them is not new, only rediscovered each generation\u201D \u2014 I love this \u2014 \u201Cwhether by an artist, a mourner, a mother, or a soldier.\u201D Later you say, you know, that you have to let go, right? Loss is about letting go. \u201CBut that we let go with the hope that others will grab hold. These objects ask very human moral questions. What right do we have to forget? What do we owe to each other\u2019s memories?\u201D So memory now takes on a moral dimension, because \u2014 that\u2019s why I take it so serious \u2014 because when I go, I\u2019ll hope someone grabs hold of me. But I have to promise I\u2019m grabbing hold of who\u2019s gone before. And I love that memory binds us in that way. And, of course, those lines get severed all the time and, I mean, I just sometimes I\u2019m overwhelmed when I think of how many people have ever been on this planet and the actual tiny, tiny fraction of them that are actually remembered to this day. Nobody remembers, even, two, three generations down the road, it\u2019s easy to start forgetting. And so memory has a spiritual dimension in that way to me. Like there was the title of a piece called \u201CHeaven Is Being a Memory to Others.\u201D Yeah. Like, my grandmother who I was deeply close to. I remember her, deeply, every day. And when I go, probably no one\u2019s going to remember her in that way again. So, for the next few decades her memory is still in a sense, life after death. This is in a sense what I think memory can do on the planet. But it\u2019s going to taper off at some point, with her in particular. And many of our family members. So I just like knowing I\u2019m going to hold on, I\u2019m going to grasp, pull hard into the last moment. I like that art can do that. So, and I think it should. It should do that. You can listen again and share this conversation with Dario Robleto through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the artist philosopher Dario Robleto. He\u2019s famous for spinning and shaping unconventional materials \u2014 dinosaur fossils, meteorite remnants, hand bones and hip bones, pulverized vinyl from vintage records. He also makes unconventional connections between art and science, the everyday and the cosmic. His most recent project is called \u201CThe Boundary of Life is Quietly Crossed\u201D. This originated with his experience of his grandmother\u2019s final heartbeats, and has extended into an ongoing exploration of the Golden Record \u2014 that\u2019s the LP of sounds and songs which Carl Sagan and a team of NASA scientists compiled in 1977 to communicate, as they said, \u201Ca story of our world to extraterrestrials.\u201D In about 10 minutes we\u2019re going to open up and have some back-and-forth and see what\u2019s on your mind. Before we do that, I\u2019d love to talk about \u2014 you allude to this \u2014 but you really do have a cosmic view. Right? It\u2019s not just about history. And you\u2019re working on this project about the Golden record. And somewhere I saw this described as, you know, returning to love and memory, like what we were just talking about, across vast reaches of time and space. Mm-hmm. Yes. The Golden Record. It\u2019s a big topic for me. I take it very seriously, too. Just as a quick preface, if you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s literally a gold record, that\u2019s attached to the Voyager probes that were launched in the late \u201870s. And Carl Sagan had been asked to basically produce a document of life on earth. And he had to do it in the space limitations of a record, which at the time were about two hours of content. Which, think of everybody\u2019s phone in here right now, has thousands of time \u2014 of more power than he and his team had to work with. So it was just incredible \u2014 incredible problem to tell the complexity of the planet through sound and image, in the space limitations of two hours, and on a medium that we ourselves have already long ago got rid of. But in September of just last year Voyager crossed a milestone \u2014 what scientists call the solar bubble. It had essentially entered interstellar space and attached to the side of the probe, which had this whole other mission of planetary exploration. But attached to it is this symbol, a long playing record with our story on it. And what\u2019s on it is a much longer story, and a beautiful one. And you\u2019ve called Carl Sagan the ultimate DJ. Yeah. And that the Golden record is the greatest mixed tape of humankind ever compiled. Well, no, it really is. And I mean \u2014 well because my point earlier about what\u2019s at stake with your musical selections? Forever is at stake with that record. But you bring an artist in, and I feel they look at it differently. And I was determined to find something that had been overlooked. And I feel confident I did. Can you tell us what it is? Well, it\u2019s a longer story\u2026 Is it top secret? But\u2026 Can you put it in one of those poetic sentences? Love survives the death of cells. Yeah. The death of cells? Yes. I think it\u2019s fascinating that you \u2014 that love is that thing you honed in on. There\u2019s this, you know, that the philosopher in you also talks about love a lot. In a very philosophical poetic way. There is a sentence that you repeat, and you actually use this in the context of the Golden record. \u201CWith nothing to risk, love can\u2019t exist.\u201D Tell us what that sentence means to you. Well, I can very specifically \u2014 also, honky-tonk memory. During those years I remember just being floored when I read in Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! \u2014 somewhere, I don\u2019t quite remember what it was. And it\u2019s become this urban myth of the mother who lifts a car off their child who\u2019s been injured. And I remember reading that and just being \u2014 I was shocked. And that, you know, in my young mind, sitting in a honky-tonk, mixing with all the other songs on that jukebox, I see now it started to turn into a philosophy, which I feel like I\u2019m more fully exploring today. But, God it was mysterious in youth when you first realized that loving something can actually physically change your body. And that connection, that my science mind again comes in, as far as that something abstract had a real-world consequence. So I love my child, and then I turned into the Incredible Hulk in the process\u2026 Right. Yeah. \u2026to lift this car off them. And yeah I think, I mean, it\u2019s so simple but it\u2019s an important thing, that something has to be at risk. Something\u2019s got to be on the line to reveal these, I think, the much more strange, complicated parts of love. That I\u2019m more interested in. Because you say love and our minds go to clich\u00E9 often. But no, it\u2019s really weird and strange if you know where to look. And it\u2019s on these weird edges of love when it\u2019s at risk and the things people will do in that moment that I find tell this beautiful alternate history of aesthetics. Like, I like to say that if you could put on the table everything anyone\u2019s ever made in a moment of loss, that that would tell as beautiful a history of aesthetics and creativity as the proper art history that we all know. But that discussion doesn\u2019t happen in art history because it\u2019s \u2014 the people making it aren\u2019t artists or it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s all of us. When push comes to shove what would you do? What could you make? What are you capable of? And something has to be at risk. So I\u2019m interested in the creative response that comes. And often it\u2019s some form of love that we didn\u2019t see coming until that happened. There\u2019s a \u2014 there was a project you did called \u201CLunge for Love as if it Were Air,\u201D which I think also had that story. Yes. In its DNA. Yeah, I like \u2014 it\u2019s just one of the my titles that I wrote. It was actually a song title on my song title list. So, that \u2014 my titles have become \u2014 they find their form finally in my objects. Even though I thought they would be for a band. So in a way, I still released them in a way, I guess. Yeah. So, I think there are some microphones wandering around that we can pass around. Oh, here it is. I like this method, I was saying beforehand, because I think the format where you have the microphones up here and people have to come to the microphone privileges the extroverts in the room. And so I want to encourage introverts to raise your hand. And you don\u2019t have to be too conspicuous, the microphone will come to you. Yes. It seems like a lot of your work it has to do with materials and material objects. And I\u2019m just wondering how you feel about a world that seems like it\u2019s increasingly digital and has a lot of information that\u2019s not necessarily embodied in physical objects. I\u2019m definitely not an anti-technology, back-in-the-old-day kind of guy. I always resist going down that road. But, for example, the past several years the only growth industry in music has been the sale of vinyl records. And I find this \u2014 these kind of forgotten little charts, indicators of something deeper happening in culture. Because I was wondering what would the Dario Robleto of today \u2014 you know, he might not grind of vinyl records to dust. I mean, what would you do? Grind dead iPods to dust or something? Yeah, no. No, it\u2019s not the same, yeah. But I suspect people will surprise us in how they answer this question, in ways we just don\u2019t know yet. Which I always \u2014 never worries me about this question because it\u2019s just too human to need to attach emotions to things. And, a quick little anecdote to your iPod point that really floored me that happened recently. A group of students I was talking to \u2014 one of the students mentioned that his father had willed it to him his record collection, and how touched he was by it. And the other students were sort of making fun of him, like, you\u2019ve got to carry that in life now? They were thinking of it as a burden, a physical burden, to carry records forward in life. And I just had this impromptu thought. Like, I asked them, \u201CHas everybody had an iPod?\u201D Of course everybody raised their hands. And then I said, \u201CHas everybody had several iPods?\u201D Everybody raised their hands. And I said, \u201CHow many of you could foresee a day when you will your iPod collection to your child?\u201D Nobody raised their hands. But what was so interesting is that instinctually they knew that seemed odd. And I don\u2019t know what to make of that, I\u2019m just saying that there\u2019s weird things like that that will happen that I will be excited to see how we solve it in the future. Where\u2019s the microphone? Raise your hand. Okay. Hi. I really appreciate the way that you honor the spirit of your material that you\u2019re working with. And I like the way you talk about memory. Particularly I\u2019m interested in the memory of water. And I was wondering what it felt like when you reunited that million-year-old water drop with that million-year-old blossom. What did it feel like? You know, just to me? Well\u2026hmm. We\u2019d like to do what it felt like to the water drop, but\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s such \u2014 I think I\u2019m being articulate and then I stumble here, because I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still this area where I don\u2019t have quite the words for it sometimes. You know, I prep so long, I look so hard, so much time and energy went into finding that rain drop and that blossom, and then the moment comes when they\u2019re together again. And it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I couldn\u2019t have done it, as I\u2019d mentioned earlier, what do I need to do to earn the respect of that material? And all those things that I did to get to that moment produced this sensation that\u2019s hard for me to describe. So, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m stumbling on that. Was there actually a moment though where you brought them together? I mean\u2026 Mm-hmm. And that you\u2026 Yeah. The idea was to bring them together again. I have this question I like to ask about. Can art finish something that never got finished? And in this way it was, could that drop finished hitting that blossom all these years later? So, that was a manifestation of that question. And that question\u2019s propelled many artworks. Can art finish something that never got finished? That leads to these kinds of interactions. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the sculptural artist and \u201Cmaterialist poet\u201D Dario Robleto at a public event at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. We\u2019re taking questions from the audience. I think it\u2019s true that there\u2019s this common perception that art connects us with the artist in a way that art is a self-expression, and so kind of the idea is that it\u2019s a way to get inside the artist\u2019s head. When I look at your work, and then when I listen to the way you describe it, it feels like instead of connecting us with you, it connects us with other lives. Another way I was thinking about it is when I\u2019ve looked at your work, it\u2019s almost like walking into a natural history museum. And that I\u2019m connecting with something else kind of bigger, or other lives, or something distant. How do you think about the role of the self in the artwork? Do you consciously try to erase or cover up? To me, this is a great fundamental art question about \u2014 because as most artists, we tap into our own history as a starting point. Many young artists do that. And, you know, Patsy Cline is \u2014 we believe her, because she\u2019s singing about her heartbreak, and that\u2019s why it counts. But my relationship to those histories that I\u2019m often referencing in the work, the dynamic\u2019s different. It can\u2019t be about me. I mean, I\u2019m making it. I\u2019m initiating it, but the point is not me. And I do try to taper out myself as much as I can, because it\u2019s not, you know, especially when we\u2019re talking about the suffering of war. I mean, come on, how can I \u2014 how can I even pretend to know? So to answer you, I do try to taper out my voice in that way because the narrative I\u2019m trying to talk about is what I want all the attention on. But then, you know, I made the object and the artist can never remove themselves totally from it. So it\u2019s not always possible. But I would think that it must please you to hear someone describe your work that way. It does. That your work connects our lives with other lives. It really does. Because I \u2014 you know, like I ask young artists that I work with, \u201CWhy should anybody care about your problem?\u201D And, when you make work about that problem, and I think every artist should be hard on themselves about that. And, you know, that\u2019s why someone like Billie Holiday or Patsy Cline have done this. They\u2019ve somehow solved this riddle of singing about their own experience, but it means \u2014 but it was all of our experience. And I mean that\u2019s like this puzzle I\u2019ll always be trying to figure out, of how do you tap in to the personal, but it\u2019s meant to be for the public interaction and meaning. I think the microphone is over here somewhere, right? Here? Hi. You had mentioned earlier something that I found intriguing, and it just kind of got glossed over. Being very badly depressed when you were younger and visiting your dad, and having this experience in the room with hearing \u201CSgt. Pepper\u2019s,\u201D and you came out and you were an artist. And it seemed like \u2014 I guess the way my mind thought, it was like, well, that must also mean that you were very depressed and you came out of the room and you weren\u2019t depressed anymore. I don\u2019t know if that resolves as quickly as becoming an artist, but I just was wondering if you could speak a little bit more on what was out of kilter that was causing that depression. And how did that resolve? Hm. Yeah. Hm. You know, this is one of those topics we\u2019re afraid to talk about, and we shouldn\u2019t be at all. And I really believe that. But yeah, I hesitate because it\u2019s related to the previous question where I don\u2019t like my work to be about that. But clearly, when I look back, it was depression absolutely. But I mean, five years old, it was a constant in life, and I just didn\u2019t understand what it was. And it has never gone away. If anything I\u2019m an artist because partly I need \u2014 it gives me a way to harness it. And to funnel it into something that takes it beyond my own problem, as I was saying. But, I didn\u2019t \u2014 when I left the room it was still there. And it just had a purpose that it didn\u2019t have before. And I struggle every day to keep that purpose on sight. But there\u2019s nothing like reading a story of a Civil War soldier carving their leg from scratch that will set you straight very quickly on your own personal depression. And I am constantly looking for those narratives to help put things in perspective. You talk a lot about your lifelong fascination with survival. And the human creative response to loss. And it sounds to me like that\u2019s just a huge root for you of that in your own life. Yeah. If I had to say in one word what\u2019s the overarching theme of my work, it\u2019s survival. And then it divides off into all these other things. But yeah, the two terms I like to use are the logic of loss and the creative response to loss as histories that cross over culture and time. That speak to something basically human. That every era, every culture deals with grief, and mourning, and loss, in that the creativity was the response to the loss. That the loss insisted on some sort of aesthetic. Writing a poem. Making an object. Something. So that notion that loss and love are connected at some fundamental level like that I find just beautifully human. Or even I think as you \u2014 you talk about memory, you know, intentional memory is itself a creative response to loss, right? Yes. Memory, yeah. Memory is one of our tools. You don\u2019t even have to be an artist. Yeah. Right. It\u2019s a tool. It\u2019s a weapon against decay and against loss being permanent. And that\u2019s a very human thing to want to struggle against that. You are also working more recently on a project called \u201CThe Boundary of Life is Quietly Crossed.\u201D Yes. Which does come a bit to this notion of the big, philosophical, existential reality of death. And my understanding is that a kind of central motif for that is your experience of your grandmother\u2019s heartbeat as she died. Is that right? Yes. Yes. I had the, what\u2019s clearly now seems like a privilege of being by her as she passed away and just instinctually put my hand on her chest. And I\u2019ll never forget those last five beats. And what they felt like. And, that deeply changed me. And the time span between the last beat up to the moment we\u2019re sitting here is a very distinct space that I feel. Because you always assume there\u2019s a beat after the last one. And then the brain realizing that\u2019s not coming is something I still grapple with. But I think what hit me the hardest in that moment was that I didn\u2019t know anything about the heart. And it was like 9/11 in that I thought, how am I ever going to understand this experience if I don\u2019t understand the heart? It\u2019s cultural history. It\u2019s mechanics. It\u2019s, I mean, everything. So right now I\u2019m in this long process of trying to answer to myself that question of, what does the heart mean? Right, \u201Cthe largely unexplored history of the human heartbeat.\u201D Yeah. And as usual, there\u2019s 100 things that nobody knows about, that I\u2019m sure nobody knows that are fascinating about this story, about this unknown history of the human heartbeat. But it originates with her, definitely. It\u2019s moving to think about it. That\u2019s moving to think about you with your grandmother, because now, anyone who has a baby now, it\u2019s one of the first things that happens, that you hear the heartbeat, and it\u2019s so incredibly exciting. Right. Thrilling beyond measure. But really when you tell that story about being with your grandmother and hearing her last five heartbeats\u2026 You know, I think that kind of comes back to some of these driving questions in your work. Does art have the power to fix something that never got fixed? To correct a wrong that\u2019s never been resolved? What can art do anymore? I wonder, just in closing, if you would talk a little bit about how those questions and how you live those questions changes as you go through life, and changes you, changes how you live your life. My idealism has not budged at all. And I\u2019m not going to let it budge. I love the nonsense that it seems like when you hear an artist say, art can change the world. And I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s true or not, I like believing in it. Because it changes how you make things. So I\u2019m constantly trying to find ways to still create objects that there\u2019s something at stake with them. And, of course, changes me in the process. And in no way am I suggesting I\u2019m there, or that I\u2019m ever going to get there, but that\u2019s almost not the point. It\u2019s \u2014 the point is the struggle to keep trying to find it. I don\u2019t know if that answered you so well. Yeah, no, it does. And I think the piece you didn\u2019t say is then to hear it come back at you, you know, the idea that then you have created objects that join our life with other lives. Yeah, I hope that happens. You never know. But the artist in me keeps trying for that to happen. Well, Dario Robleto, citizen, DJ, philosopher, artist. It\u2019s been a pleasure to be in your company tonight. Thank you.
