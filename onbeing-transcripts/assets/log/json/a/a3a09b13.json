  "fullText": "We have these categories, work, life, and we have brains, brawn, so on. All the different distinctions that we make. We make them mindfully, and then we start to use them mindlessly, forgetting that when we\u2019re at work, we\u2019re people. We have the same needs we had when we were on vacation. And you should get to the point where you\u2019re treating yourself whether you\u2019re at work or at play in basically the same way. Ellen Langer is a social psychologist who some have dubbed \u201Cthe mother of mindfulness.\u201D But she defines mindfulness with counterintuitive simplicity: the simple act of actively noticing things \u2014 with a result of increased health, competence, and happiness. Her take on mindfulness has never involved contemplation or meditation or yoga. It comes straight out of her provocative, unconventional studies, which have been suggesting for decades what neuroscience is pointing at now: our experience of everything is formed by the words and ideas we attach to them. What makes a vacation a vacation is not only a change of scenery \u2014 but the fact that we let go of the mindless everyday illusion that we are in control. Ellen Langer has shown it\u2019s possible to become physiologically younger through a changed frame of mind; to find joy in what was experienced as drudgery by renaming it as play; and to induce weight loss by substituting the label \u201Cexercise\u201D for labor. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard University. I spoke with her in 2014. I do always start my interviews by asking, was there a religious or spiritual or philosophical background to your childhood that had anything to do with \u2026 No. \u2026what you now describe as mindfulness? I mean, was that there\u2026 No. No? No, not at all. Nothing at all? My parents were wonderfully supportive. Yeah. And my mother was so supportive, she would have had me laminated if she could have. Always bragging about me. Yeah. And I think it was because they were so supportive that I had the strength, courage, whatever, without feeling it that way, to ask questions and to be out in the world the way many others might have been inhibited. Mm-hmm. Also, people are constantly saying to me, why are you smiling? And so, I was aware very early on that most of the people I was meeting, in all different environments, were less than happy. So, one of the things you\u2019ve said is that most of us live mindlessly virtually all of the time. And you say that with a smile on your face, but you mean it. Yes. Yes. Oh, I mean it. And I find that, I\u2019m not infrequently, not frequently, but not infrequently, I, too, am mindless. As I\u2019m fond of saying, whatever you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re doing it either mindfully or mindlessly. Mm-hmm. And the consequences of being in one state of mind or the other are enormous. So, in study after study, we plug in, you know, we manipulate this mindfulness. And change the measures from study to study. And, almost no matter what we put in, that when we encourage people to be more mindful, we find enormous improvements. OK, so let me ask you the question this way. I\u2019m just wondering, did you ever investigate this mindfulness the way Buddhism talked about, or have you always just explored it\u2026 No. \u2026separately? Yeah. Well, actually, in the early \u201970s, I was studying mindlessness. OK. OK. And then, you know, and found and continue to find that\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s so interesting. \u2026mindlessness is pervasive. Yeah. Most people are just not there, and they\u2019re not there to know that they\u2019re not there. And when I address the difference between mindlessness and mindfulness \u2014 so since my mindlessness was leading in my thinking, there was no reason for me to appeal to anything Eastern. This was all a Western scientific notion I was developing. Right. So interesting. And so, mindfulness, for me, is the very simple process of actively noticing new things. When you actively notice new things that puts you in the present, makes you sensitive to context. As you\u2019re noticing new things, it\u2019s engaging. And it turns out, after a lot of research, that we find that it\u2019s literally, not just figuratively, enlivening. So the Eastern notions \u2014 I did research, again, back in the \u201980s, on transcendental meditation. And that\u2019s also, meditation is also useful, but it\u2019s quite different \u2014 different ways of getting to the same place. Meditation, no matter what kind of meditation, is engaged to produce post-meditative mindfulness. Right. Right. OK. And the mindfulness, as I and my students\u2026 It\u2019s a means to an end and you\u2019re going\u2026 Exactly. \u2026straight to the end. Exactly, exactly. So, for us, you know, you\u2019re noticing new things. You\u2019re there. And I think that over the last 10, maybe even 20 years, that if you look at all of the different forms of treatments to become more mindful, this means to the same end, that they have become more and more like what we\u2019ve been studying from the beginning. Meditation that used to be required 20 minutes twice a day is slowly changing. But I find that what lots of these people do, and it\u2019s also part of folk psychology, where you tell people, you know, \u201Cbe there, be in the moment.\u201D When you\u2019re not in the moment, you\u2019re not there to know you\u2019re not there. So it\u2019s really an empty instruction. So\u2026 And I think, you know, some of the language you use that\u2019s just slightly different, that\u2019s slightly original, over against\u2026 Just slightly original, excuse me. Well no, very, very deeply original. But I mean\u2026 OK . \u2026I mean, original. It\u2019s nuanced in a way \u2014 it\u2019s subtlety different. Yeah. So, to talk about presence, I mean, it\u2019s not that you never use the term presence, but you more often use the term noticing. Yeah, noticing \u2014 well, because you can\u2026 Noticing new things, yeah. I don\u2019t think you can make a decision that I\u2019m going to be present. What does that mean? You know, so that the people who tell you to meditate, there\u2019s an assumption that over time that will put you in the present. But if you\u2019re actively noticing things \u2014 so, you\u2019re going to home tonight and if you live with somebody, notice five new things about that person. It\u2019s very \u2014 it can be very specific. And what will happen is the person will start to come alive for you again. And that facilitates the relationship. You also describe in a very illuminating way how this begins early, early in our lives \u2014 that the unconditional way we learn in childhood, we pick up rules before we have a chance to question them\u2026 Yes. \u2026we\u2019re given rules, and facts, and names for everything. Right. And, you know, so we\u2019re led to believe that there\u2019s a single way of viewing things, but then at some point, somebody tells us that there are other people that might have a different view. So, we sort of acknowledge that. You know, if you say to somebody is there more than \u2014 is there only one way of looking at things? Everybody will say there are many ways. But then they go through their lives looking at it from a single perspective. We really \u2014 we\u2019re afraid of uncertainty, and what I say in response to that is that we need to distinguish between what I call universal uncertainty, and personal uncertainty. So, personal uncertainty is: \u201CI don\u2019t know, I know I don\u2019t know, maybe you know, therefore I have to fake it in some way.\u201D Or feel bad about not knowing it or whatever. Right. Universal uncertainty is an awareness: \u201CI don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t know, in some sense we really can\u2019t know.\u201D And that then the interaction proceeds differently. And so, in a personal context, when you do something that seems to me to be not right in some way, hurtful, you know, whatever, that if I\u2019m operating within this absolute framework, this mindless framework, I then draw all sorts of negative attributions about you. I expect that you\u2019re this kind of person. I then label you that way, respond to you in the future that way, and it\u2019s almost impossible for you to break away from that. In this other way of viewing the world, where you really understand that \u2014 you come to understand that people\u2019s behavior makes sense from their perspective, or else they wouldn\u2019t have done it. Because you\u2019re not clinging\u2026 So that when\u2026 \u2026so tightly\u2026 Exactly. \u2026and in an unreflected way to what you think order and stability are about, and what you think happened as though that\u2019s the only reality. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, and so then, then you come to see \u2014 I mean, if you just ask yourself \u2014 what sense does that behavior make? So you might see me as gullible but in fact, what I am is trusting. Mm-hmm. I might see somebody else as \u2014 somebody might see somebody as rigid, but what they are is stable. And when you do this, you can sort of imagine how all sorts of interpersonal conflict falls by the wayside. Right? That all of the reasons you\u2019re fighting with this person, or you dislike this person, whether it\u2019s at home or at work, now you might have disliked them because they were so damned impulsive. But now you see they\u2019re spontaneous. And so if it\u2019s the case that now I see that the things that are happening to me are a function of my view of them, I needn\u2019t be so afraid. Right. So then I stand tall, and I can go out in the world, and all sorts of good things are going to happen. And, you know, each part, again, reinforcing the other. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with social psychologist Ellen Langer. In one of her most famous studies, she found that it was possible to lower obesity and diabetes in chambermaids, who spent their entire days in motion, by essentially helping them name their everyday activity not as work but as \u201Cexercise.\u201D And her book, Counterclockwise, tells the story of her experiment to demonstrably turn the clock back on age with a group of men in their 70s and 80s. You do, I think, quite often work with organizations, businesses\u2026 Yes. \u2026and you sometimes give very practical, kind of, exercises, thought experiments to people, to put them into this mode. Right, and one of the things that I\u2019ve recently spent some time with and have started to write about it with respect to business, is what I think started off as a good idea, where people would say you must have work/life balance. Right. And, work/life balance is certainly better than work/life imbalance. But I think that the concept is basically mindless. And the reason for that is that we have these categories \u2014 work, life, and we have brains, brawn, so on. All the different distinctions that we make, we make them mindfully, and then we start to use them mindlessly, forgetting that when we\u2019re at work, we\u2019re people. We have the same needs we had when we were on vacation. That when we\u2019re talking to people, the people we\u2019re talking to also have the same needs. And so on. And I can elaborate on this in a moment. But the idea, I think, to replace work/life balance, which treats these categories as independent, is work/life integration. And you should get to the point where you\u2019re treating yourself whether you\u2019re at work or at play in basically the same way. Have you studied how this kind of change in the experience through just the language you\u2019re applying, whether it\u2019s work or play? Yeah. We did a few studies where we had people do things where they were given a label. Either work or play. And in this particular study, it was interesting because what we had people do was to read and evaluate cartoons, jokes. So you would think that that content would have been fun. Right. When they were doing it under the aegis of work, what happened is their minds wandered, they didn\u2019t enjoy it. One of the ways we knew that was when we asked them how much they would need to be paid in order to do more of this. For example, they needed a lot more, you know, than the other group, who was just playing. In some environments, it\u2019s difficult, because you don\u2019t want to be joking when you\u2019re talking to this person if they have a lot of power over you. But, you want yourself never to take yourself too seriously, and to know that whatever you\u2019re doing can be done in many different ways. You also did this fascinating study with chambermaids, who, if you looked objectively at the work they were doing, they were moving all day long, right? Right. They were by any definition exercising. But they thought of it as work. Right. And then, it was also this example, wasn\u2019t it, where you changed the language and it actually had these incredible physiological effects. Yeah, and it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re pointing this out. I was just talking to one of my graduate students right before coming to the station about several other studies that we\u2019re doing on language. And it probably runs through my whole career, where you change a word or two here or there, and you get vastly different effects. The chambermaid study was part of a series that I had begun back, I guess \u2014 started the research in \u201979, I remember, because we published it in \u201981. And that was first reported in this Mindfulness book. That was the retreat study where I took old men to a timeless retreat that had been retrofitted to 20 years earlier and had them live there as if it was the present, speaking in the present tense, and so on, and \u2026 But as though they were 20 years younger. Right, exactly. Yeah. And the effects from that study were phenomenal, basically because these were really old people. You know, these people were in their mid-to-late 80s, but that\u2019s when 80 was 80. Not the new 60. Yeah. This was a long time ago. But, so they \u2014 what drove that study was the same thing that drove the chambermaid study, and I can talk more about either one. But it\u2019s this \u2014 call it \u201Cthe mind/body unity theory.\u201D So, it occurred to me that mind and body are just words and that \u2014 you have a question? No, no. I was just \u2014 I\u2019m just \u2026 You just \u2014 you have a breath? I\u2019m breathing appreciatively. Yeah. Oh, okay. You know, and so, it could have been mind, body, and elbow. And then we would have had a different conception of people. Right. And so, it seemed to me that if, at least for heuristic purposes, just to see how far we could push this \u2014 if we say that mind and body are one, we\u2019re no longer asking questions like how do you get from the mind to the body? Even though the medical world \u2014 not that long ago actually \u2014 and the medical model, believe that the only thing that\u2019s going to affect the body as far as disease is concerned, is the introduction of a pathogen. And that psychology mattered very little. Right. And now, you know, that\u2019s changed. But my view is more extreme than the way the medical world and \u2014 some of the medical world, and other psychologists studying this believe. Because they\u2019re still looking for the way the mind influences the body. But if we put them back together, then it\u2019s one, and it \u2014 the question doesn\u2019t make the same amount of sense. So what we do is we say let\u2019s treat the mind and body as one. If we do that, we put this thing in a context; both the mind and the body are in that same context. So the first test of this was this study with elderly men, where we\u2019re going to put their mind in an earlier time. And as a result of living in that environment in this retreat we had set up for a week, their hearing improved, their vision improved, their memory improved, their strength improved. At the end of this they were evaluated by people who knew nothing about the study as looking significantly younger than comparison years. So they \u2014 their minds pretended that they were 20 years younger\u2026 Well, we\u2019re hoping that\u2026 \u2026and they started to seem 20 years younger. Yeah, exactly. \u2026in every way. You know, but it\u2019s not just, you know \u2014 when we talk about pretending\u2026 Right. Or placebo. \u2026we have to be careful, because\u2026 Yeah. \u2026you know, sometimes when you\u2019re pretending, you\u2019re aware you\u2019re pretending. Yep. And so your mind is in one place, and that\u2019s where your body\u2019s going to be, not in that new state, but if you fully get into it\u2026 Yeah. So, for instance, one of the things that I would expect \u2014 and I probably should do this at some point \u2014 is we take actors that are playing the part of somebody very different from themselves, and they\u2019re good actors. That if we took all the physiological measures, we would find they were \u2014 the measures were more like the person \u2014 the role they were playing, than the person, him or herself. This Counterclockwise study\u2026 And that was the men \u2014 the age experiment. Right, the people going back to the retreat. Yeah. Was then part of a \u2014 the basis of a series that the BBC put together. So the study was replicated in England, and more recently in South Korea and the Netherlands. And that feels good, because those are such different cultures, yet it seems to work the same way. Well, I\u2026 And so\u2026 Yes, and I think what should also should be pretty remarkable for you is \u2014 I mean, you were doing that study, what\u2019d you say, 19 \u2014 in the \u201970\u2019s. \u201979 was when we started it. Right, but then you made this off-the-cuff remark a minute ago about how this is when 80 was 80 and not the new 60. And, the fact is, that now, 30 years on from when you started doing this study\u2026 Yes. \u2026we have had this cultural transformation in our imagination about what it means to be 40 or 50 or 60 or 80. And literally, I mean, I feel like in the last 10 years, you know, 60 is not what 60 was. Fifty is not what 50 was. Right. It\u2019s amazing. Yeah, and I think so, too. Not about the studied effect, although I do find that amazing. No, but, I mean, I\u2019m saying that there\u2019s actually\u2026 The culture has\u2026 \u2026has borne out the question you were asking. Yes. Yeah. If we change our minds about it, would the body change as well? Yeah, and that if you just look at the activities that people are willing to engage right now. Yeah. I think yoga is wonderful. I think running is wonderful. I think that anything that somebody takes on to improve themselves, that \u2014 without suffering if they\u2019re not doing it well enough or what have you \u2014 is good. I think that there\u2019s a component of it that\u2019s not at all dissimilar from everything \u2014 this mind/body unity idea. Once I decide that I\u2019m going to start running because when I run, I\u2019m going to be healthy, now I\u2019m believing I\u2019m being healthy\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and that should translate into greater health. What I\u2019m saying is many of these practices have a large placebo effect and that the placebo itself can be explained by this theory. And, you had \u2014 this I found so interesting when I started to think about it \u2014 that here you have this wonderful, wonderful drug \u2014 placebo. Yeah. That because of the way it was studied in the medical world, it was \u2014 anybody who was trying to assess the efficacy of a drug was upset when it didn\u2019t outperform the placebo. Right. However, that placebo was curing a lot of people. So it\u2019s a very, very powerful medication. Yeah. And so, my work has been devoted to try to find a way over time and all these different studies, to return that control over our health back to ourselves. Right. I think it was a conversation I had with Esther Sternberg, who\u2019s an immunologist, about how \u2014 I mean, all the placebo is doing is unlocking your brain\u2019s own pharmacy. Right. But for some reason, we\u2019ve never thought of placebo that way. You\u2019re right. We\u2019ve thought of it as still this thing that doctors give that is illusory. Yeah. And not just illusory, that it was a bad a thing. Yeah. You know, that if people early on \u2014 I don\u2019t think this would be the case now, but if people were told, and there\u2019s evidence for this, actually, if people are told that the pill they took is a placebo, it doesn\u2019t work. Yeah. Right. You know, um\u2026 And then it doesn\u2019t work, right? If they know that. Exactly. Exactly. You can listen again and share this conversation with Ellen Langer through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: a conversation with social psychologist Ellen Langer. Her unconventional, creative portfolio of studies, have long suggested what neuroscience is now pointing at: that our experiences of everything are formed by the words and ideas we attach to them. Ellen Langer was one of the earliest pioneers in drawing a connection between mindlessness and unhappiness \u2014 and between mindfulness and health, along with figures like Jon Kabat-Zinn and Herbert Benson. Distinctively though, her approach does not in the first instance incorporate any technique like meditation, or breathing, or yoga. I want to move on and talk to you about \u2014 you said something really intriguing when we started about believing that we are at an evolution in consciousness. That mindfulness has emerged full-blown, as a word suddenly that everyone in America knows. Yeah. And I really enjoyed a blog post you wrote, I think it was a blog post you wrote about \u2014 I think this was when Arianna Huffington was first talking about the third metric, maybe before the book was published. Yeah . Right. And you went and you said \u2026 Oh. It sounds like, you know \u2014 Katie Couric was there, and Dr. Mark Hyman was there, who\u2019s now well-known as the Clintons\u2019 physician. And they were all asking questions and batting this around, and you felt \u2014 you said, \u201CI felt like saying, maybe shouting, \u2018Yes, yes, I couldn\u2019t agree more, since I\u2019ve been studying this since the 1970s and making all the recommendations that were being presented as new.\u2019\u201D Yeah, no, I had an ego moment. It\u2019s funny, because when I was at that conference, I was oblivious to what was going to be going on. [laughs] Oh, before you went? Well, I knew the people that were going. I didn\u2019t know everybody was going to be talking about mindfulness. Mm-hmm. And that mindfulness increases health, competence, and happiness, which you\u2019ve been\u2026 Yeah. I mean, so it was just a very\u2026 Yeah. But, anyway, so that was not one of my better moments . But say some more about this notion of evolution of consciousness. I mean, really what \u2014 flesh that out, what do you mean when you say that? It\u2019s a big statement. Yeah, it\u2019s a big statement, and maybe it\u2019s too big for what I mean by it. It\u2019s really just reflecting on what you said a moment before, that, you know, 20 years ago, or, you know, let\u2019s go back to the \u201970s, early \u201970s when I started this work, nobody was thinking in these terms. There were, you know, monks out in Asia meditating, and a few people here or there. But it really wasn\u2019t part of the culture. And now, as you\u2019ve said, it\u2019s very much a part, where people have the expectation that they\u2019re supposed to live right \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 they\u2019re supposed to take care of their bodies, and I think that one can pursue yoga mindlessly. One can even pursue meditation mindlessly. Right. And again, I just want to name this. I mean, you actually are not studying or talking about meditating, necessarily. No. Or doing yoga. Or\u2026 No, and I\u2019m not\u2026 \u2026being, you know, being mindful as a practice. Again, I mean, your definition is all that\u2019s necessary to seek out, create, and notice new things. Right. Yeah, no, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m not disparaging\u2026 No, no, right. \u2026any of the other approaches, but it is quite different. And you know, if you thought about how to put it in place that \u2014 it\u2019s really much simpler than getting people to meditate. And the two are not mutually exclusive at all. Right. One can do both. Yeah. But if I were to consider meditation versus this direct mindfulness as I study it, I would say that for those people who think, and some people do, that unless they do something drastic, their life circumstances aren\u2019t going to change. Well, so, if somebody\u2019s living in the West, often times it\u2019s taking up a practice like meditation or yoga. You know, you change your life in some big way, and then you have the belief \u2014 which has a placebo part of it but it\u2019s as wonderful \u2014 to lead to all sorts of other big changes in your life. For other people, mindlessly as well on the other side, perhaps, that they get scared about things that are just too foreign. And so this whole idea of doing what these monks do, doesn\u2019t feel right. I think that one should be doing both, but it\u2019s good that we have so many people now from the two different approaches. I was going to say camps, but then that sounds sort of warring, which is not the case. Yeah. Doing this to enlist more and more people into this way of being. You know, this is something from, I believe from your book Mindfulness \u2014 you talked about doing a sabbatical at Harvard Business School. And that the students, or faculty there, helped you kind of just distill your \u2014 how you apply this to business into two sentences. I just \u2014 I thought they were really helpful. \u201CMindlessness is the application of yesterday\u2019s business solutions to today\u2019s problems. Mindfulness\u2014\u201D Yeah, no, they didn\u2019t come up with that. Oh, they didn\u2019t. No . But they helped you formulate these sentences, right? Or you said\u2026 OK, yes. \u2026you formulated them there in that context. \u201CAnd mindfulness is attunement to today\u2019s demands to avoid tomorrow\u2019s difficulties.\u201D Yeah. Did I say that? Yes, no, I did. And, yes I\u2019m sure that spending the semester over there, I was teaching a course to their junior faculty, and it was interesting because they approach problems so differently. And, the problem, again, as you said, that businesses are typically applying yesterday\u2019s solutions to today\u2019s problems. And I think that in this search for the solution, they \u2014 in this mindless search, they tend to miss what\u2019s often right in front of them. When I give talks in businesses, and I\u2019m trying to get people first to appreciate how mindless they are, what I do is I give them many examples. For example, even a simple thing like \u2014 I might ask, \u201CHow much is one and one?\u201D And I know there are people that are listening to this that are saying to themselves, \u201COh, God. Are we going to have to listen to a whole hour of this, you know, thinking that?\u201D Anyway, and so then they obligingly say \u201Ctwo,\u201D and then I inform them that, no, one and one is sometimes two. It\u2019s not always two. And I give them different examples. The easiest one to understand is if you take one wad of chewing gum and you add it to one wad of chewing gum\u2026 Right. \u2026you get one. Right. And so it is with each of the things. So I think that you have a belief, and then you seek out a confirmation for it. And so the more mindful approach would be to ask the question in both ways. How is it this way, and how is it not this way? We talk a lot about stress when \u2014 both in my lab, and then in a business context \u2014 that for anybody, when there\u2019s stress, there\u2019s an assumption that they\u2019re making that something is going to happen \u2014 number one \u2014 and that when it happens, it\u2019s going to be awful. Yeah. Both of those are mindless. You want to open it up, both ways. First, the belief that it\u2019s going to happen. All you need to do is ask yourself for evidence that it\u2019s not going to happen. And you always find evidence for whatever you ask yourself. OK. So if you have, you know \u2014 I\u2019m going to be fired. Yep. Maybe it\u2019ll happen, maybe it won\u2019t, and when it happens, it\u2019ll have good parts and bad parts. And it\u2019s just much easier to go forward then. I have a one-liner with that, you know. Yeah, go ahead. \u201CNo worry before its time.\u201D Right yeah. I remember Eckhart Tolle saying that stress is all about not wanting whatever is happening to be happening. That that is the stress. Which is another way of describing what you\u2019re talking about. Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. I think it\u2019s more not about what\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s about the presumption of something that\u2019s going to happen. What I\u2019m saying is that I think stress follows from the belief that this future event will happen. When you\u2019re in the middle of the event, you\u2019re dealing with it one way or the other. Right. But, yeah, I think that it goes back in some sense to Epictetus, who said, not in English, and not with my accent, but that \u201CEvents don\u2019t cause stress. What causes stress are the views you take of events.\u201D Yeah. Once people can appreciate \u2014 see, right now, almost everybody is mindlessly driven by these absolutes and part of these absolutes are these evaluations of good or bad. If it\u2019s good, I feel I must have it. If it\u2019s bad, I must avoid it. When it\u2019s neither good nor bad, I can just stay put. And just be. Hmm. So we get a lot more control by recognizing the way we\u2019re controlling our present and our future. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with social psychologist Ellen Langer, who some have dubbed \u201Cthe mother of mindfulness.\u201D She was a pioneer in the science of revealing immediate life benefits of mindfulness \u2014 which she describes as \u201Cthe simple act of actively noticing things\u201D \u2014 achieved without meditation. You write in an interesting way about time and how our perception of time itself plays into this. Yeah. Well, just to underscore this, that my belief is that our beliefs are not inconsequential. It\u2019s not that they matter a little. That they\u2019re almost the only thing that does matter. It\u2019s a very extreme statement. OK. So, that if you were going to say, what matters, real or perceived time? To me, it would be perceived time. Right. So, let\u2019s say we have you in the study, you go to sleep, you wake up and you see the clock. And the clock, for half of the people, is running twice as fast as normal \u2014 not for half the people, for a third of the people. For a half, the clock is slowed down. For the last third, it\u2019s accurate. So, what that means is that upon waking, a third of the people will think they got, let\u2019s say, two hours more sleep than they got, two hours fewer sleep than they got, or the amount of sleep that they actually got. And the question is, when you\u2019re then given biological and cognitive psychological tasks, do these tasks reflect real or perceived time? And, clearly, I believe that, you know, when you wake up in the morning, and you think that you had a good night\u2019s sleep, you\u2019re ready to go, regardless of how much sleep you actually had. You know, up until a point, of course. I think that\u2019s, you know, somehow our perception of time, especially, in this moment where the pace of technological change seems to be so fast. Yeah. It really plays into a lot of stress, whether it\u2019s how we think about multitasking, or procrastinating, right? All these things are involved\u2026 Right. Right. \u2026with our relationship to time and deadlines. Yeah, I think one of the things that we might do, when we\u2019re so worried about what\u2019s going to happen in the future, is to think about all the times we worried in the past and the thing didn\u2019t happen. Right. Well, OK, so I\u2019d really \u2014 I want to ask you, what did you say a minute ago? That the way that you do this, this direct mindfulness, right? This is what you study. This is what you preach in your way. And so just take us through what is this application of direct mindfulness, and all these thing you learn, look like in a, you know, in a day in the life? I think that what happens is that I\u2019m not afraid of very many things out there, because I\u2019ll be able to handle it. I\u2019m not going to give up today worrying about tomorrow. And that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know want to get into an argument with economists, which I could, about, you know, putting money away for the future, and so on. It\u2019s \u2014 this is at a different level of analysis. OK. But that much of the worrying, almost all of the worrying we engage in is about something about tomorrow, when we can\u2019t predict what tomorrow is going to be like. But you say and write again and again that this is easy. Yes, OK. So\u2026 But it doesn\u2019t sound easy. Right? And is it something \u2014 does it get easier with time? Is it\u2026 Yeah. \u2026something that you\u2019ve learned? Yeah. And, I think it\u2019s not easy to \u2014 where you do this for five minutes and then, you know, with respect to one kind of content, and then your whole life is going to change, although that could happen. But the practice, I said to you, just go home, or call somebody on the phone, or when we stop now, go see somebody in the next room, and notice new things about them. Mm-hmm. And this person that you thought you knew will, you know, will feel different. And that person will respond to you differently. And this happens instantly. Mm-hmm. That if you are doing something that is difficult, and you say to yourself, \u201CWhat am I so worried about? What are the positive things that could happen by my not completing this?\u201D Or, \u201CHow can I make this into a game?\u201D \u201CWhy is it that I think my life depends on whatever this thing is?\u201D Because very rarely does our life depend on any particular action. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Yeah. As soon as that \u2014 people live a life that is ongoing, but treat it as if whatever\u2019s happening at the moment is the last opportunity they\u2019re going to have. Right. So, you know, it\u2019s very striking that the American Psychological Association has said of your work that it has offered new hope to millions whose problems were previously seen as unalterable and inevitable. Will therapy, 20 years from now, or 100 years from now, be \u2014 resemble at all what was in Woody Allen movies which remains the kind of stereotype of what therapy is a couple of decades ago. I think probably not. I think it\u2019s already changing. I think that many, many years ago, I had said that therapy should be divided into two parts. And so, we have people who can say to you, in a sophisticated way that \u201CI know how you feel. And you\u2019ll be OK.\u201D But they\u2019re not the same people who necessarily can tell you how to get on with it, and what actually to do to be happy. Right. So they can get you from being unhappy to neutral in some sense. OK. So, what happens is now we have a new discipline of coaches. And that\u2019s where they take off. And so, you know, I am \u2014 many of the people who are seeing coaches would have been people who would have been in therapy in the past. Right. Right. That\u2019s interesting. Yeah. And I\u2019m sure that there will be many changes in the future. But, go on. I mean, it seems like psychology \u2014 I mean, this is not my observation, it\u2019s behind a lot of, you know, like Richard Davidson\u2019s work, for example. I mean, that a lot of psychology and psychiatry was so focused on pathology. You\u2019re also \u2014 you\u2019re focusing on taking charge of, and making \u2014 Yeah, and then I\u2019m, from the very start\u2026 \u2026each moment what you want to be in a positive sense. Yeah. When I started doing research, the field was consumed with problems. Right. And right from the start my research was about well-being, and \u2014 interesting that it was too soft a word to talk about happiness. So I talked about well-being. I think that things are progressing in this way that surely, you know, we have a whole field of positive psychology. Yeah. And, I think that my last book, the Counterclockwise book, the subtitle, the psychology \u2014 or the power of possibility, is still a little different where instead of describing what is, even if we\u2019re describing it in a more positive way, that we create what we want it to be. I want to say, I think it\u2019s really important when you say \u2014 you know this sentence that you spoke just a moment ago about, that we think about what is \u2014 instead of thinking about what is, it\u2019s what we want to be, what is possible. You know, we hear a lot of language like that now in kind of the self-help genre, that can be quite \u2014 that can be thin. But you say that as a scientist who\u2019s been\u2026 Yeah. \u2026actually seeing this actualized. Yeah. Again, back to the study of language. Many years ago, I talked about the difference between \u201Ccan\u201D and \u201Chow can.\u201D It seems so similar, but they\u2019re vastly different. When you ask yourself how do you do something, you\u2019re bypassing your ego in some sense. You\u2019re just out there examining, fiddling with things trying to find the solution. If you ask yourself \u201Ccan you do it?\u201D then all you can appeal to is the past, and so with lots of things \u2014 when people say, \u201Cpeople can only do A, B, or C,\u201D the first thought in my mind is always, well, how do we know that? How could that be? I ask my students that \u2014 I say how fast \u2014 this was around the time of the Boston Marathon \u2014 and I\u2019ll say, how fast is it humanly possible to run? And they do some strange calculations, because these are wonderful kids, they come up with things like 28 miles, 20, you know, 32.5. Who knows? And then I tell them about the Tarahumara in Copper Canyon in Mexico. And these are people who are without stopping, running 100, 200 miles a day. I had this discussion with a friend of mine when we were both part of the medical school division on aging, and I called him one day, and I said, \u201CHow long would you say \u2014 he\u2019s a physician \u2014 it takes for a broken finger to heal?\u201D And so he said, \u201CI\u2019ll say a week.\u201D I said, \u201COK, if I said to you I could heal it by psychological means in five days, what would you say?\u201D He said, \u201CWell, all right.\u201D \u201CI said what about four days?\u201D He said, \u201COkay.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat about three days?\u201D He says, \u201CNo.\u201D I said, \u201COkay, what about three days and 23 hours?\u201D OK, the point being\u2026 Yeah. \u2026you know, when is that moment that on this side you can, on the other side, you can\u2019t? So, I mean, it strikes me that there are also really civic public life implications to this. Yes. Yes. And I was thinking about it, I mean, because if you think about the fact that in our public life, which is something I puzzle over a lot, we tend to only ask the can we, right? The yes/no question. And then we argue the yes or the no. Mm-hmm. And we actually don\u2019t create a lot of possibility\u2026 Right. \u2026on really important subjects. Yes. Which is \u2014 I mean, so I think you\u2019re putting that in a different context, which is really interesting to think about. Yeah. I think that \u2014 here\u2019s another one that will sound strange. But, I\u2019m against compromise. Yeah. What? Because to compromise sounds so mindful. OK, say some more. I like it. Well, the reason for that is because it\u2019s an agreement for everybody to lose. It\u2019s just reducing your losses. Yeah. You know, rather than finding the win/win solution, which is often out there. Well, it seems like we could talk about that for another hour. We\u2019re coming close to the end, I want to ask you a final, kind of, big question. Talking about becoming mindful is also really talking about becoming conscious. Yes. And asking the question how can we live well, is an existential question. It\u2019s a variation, if you will, it\u2019s an evolution of this question that\u2019s been passed through human history. So, I just wonder how this work you do makes you think differently about that big question of what it means to be human, and what we may be learning about that, that we haven\u2019t grasped before. Yeah. Interesting. Well, I was going to write a mindful utopia at one point, and eventually maybe I will, and give this sort of question real thought. But I think that most of the ills that people experience as individuals, in their relationships, in groups, in cultures, globally \u2014 and that\u2019s a very big statement \u2014 virtually all of the ills are a result of mindlessness, one way or the other. Directly or indirectly. And so that as the culture becomes more mindful, I think all of these things will naturally change. You know, on the cultural level, people are fighting over limited resources, but resources are probably not nearly as limited as people mindlessly presume. People\u2019s egos are at stake, even while they\u2019re negotiating on the level of countries. Yeah. And they\u2019re not looked at in that fashion and approached in that way. That when you have people going to work feeling good about themselves and the work life is exciting for them, fun for them, nurturing for them, they\u2019re going to be doing more work. And they\u2019re going to be less evaluative of other people. And once we all start feeling less evaluated, that allows us to become more creative, mindful, take more risks, because they\u2019re not very risky and to be kinder in our views of other people. Ultimately I think that for me, what it means to be human is to feel unique but to recognize that everybody else is also unique. And, I think that people \u2014 right now, I think people feel that being happy, really happy in this deep way that I\u2019m referring to \u2014 not that you\u2019ve just won an award or bought something new or whatever \u2014 that that they think that this is something that one should experience sometimes. You know, maybe if you experience it a little more than other people, you\u2019re one of the lucky ones. Yeah. Where, I think it should be the way you are all the time. And that \u2014 but, I mean, so you know, you said a while ago \u201Cmost things are an inconvenience, rather than a tragedy.\u201D There are tragedies. So, what is this happiness, how does this way of being\u2026 Well, it\u2019s interesting\u2026 \u2026function in those moments\u2026 Yeah, let me give you an example of something. Many years ago, I had a major fire that destroyed 80 percent of what I owned. And when I called the insurance company, and they came over the next day, the person \u2014 the insurance agent, had said to me that this was the first call that he\u2019d ever had where the damage was worse than the call. And, I thought of it, I thought, \u201CWell, gee, you know, it\u2019s already taken my stuff, whatever that means.\u201D Yeah. \u201CWhy give it my soul? You know, that \u2014 why pay twice?\u201D Which is what people so often do. Something happens, you have that loss, and then you\u2019re going to now throw all your emotional energy at it. And so you\u2019re doubling up on the negativity. And interesting, you know, to go back to how would you take a tragedy and make \u2014 and see it \u2014 because we can say, the fire was not a simple little thing. That I stayed in a hotel for a little while. I had two dogs with me. So I was a vision as I walked through the lobby every day, while my house was being rebuilt. And it was Christmas when this happened, a few days before Christmas Eve. On Christmas Eve, I left my room, I come back many hours later, and the room was full of gifts. And it wasn\u2019t from the management, it wasn\u2019t from the owner of the hotel. It was the people who parked my car, the chambermaids, the waiters. It was marvelous. When you strip away all the mindless insecurity, people are quite something. And so I reflect on that. I couldn\u2019t tell you anything that I had lost in the fire. But at this point, I have that memory that was more than positive. So sometimes the ways that things unfold can take place over a longer time.
