  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, with chaplain Major John Morris, we explore how war challenges the spirit of soldiers, communities and the nation. His insights into the soul of war have been shaped through active duty in some of the worst fighting in Iraq. He is working now with National Guard and Reserve personnel who are being mobilized in Iraq and Afghanistan at record levels. Yet, they have little support in resuming their lives. We take a citizen off the street of Minneapolis, and we turn them into a warrior, a person who, upon demand, without a split-second hesitation, will point a weapon at another human being and shoot them until they don\u2019t get up again. It takes six months to get a person ready to do that. Then we put them in combat for 12 months. Then in 300 hours, we can have them from their last mission back on the street in their civilian clothes. There\u2019s a problem there. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. In recent decades, we have acquired the language of post-traumatic stress to treat veterans after combat. My guest this hour says that we must also find new language, rituals, and practices, as a society, to support all veterans as they rejoin their lives, their families, and their communities. Chaplain Major John Morris speaks with honesty and passion from his own experience in Iraq and his work now with returning soldiers and Guardsmen and women. Being a warrior, he says, is at once heroic and spiritually bruising even under the noblest of circumstances. The war on terror will be with us for many years to come, Major Morris warns, and we must pay closer attention to the imprint it is leaving on military personnel, for their sake and for ours.\u201D From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Soul of War.\u201D Since September 11th, 2001, 1.5 million military men and women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. And more than 1 million have returned to pick up their lives across the U.S. We often use movies and books to make sense of such epic events. Tom Hanks\u2019 portrayal of an English teacher-turned-World War II soldier in Saving Private Ryan is often cited by veterans as an accurate window into the spiritual disconnect that is wrought by military service. So I guess I\u2019ve changed some. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019ve changed so much my wife is even going to recognize me, whenever it is I get back to her. And how I\u2019ll ever be able to \u2014 to tell her about days like today. I just know that every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel. My guest, Chaplain Major John Morris, is now working, as he says, to bring veterans all the way home. He co-founded a pioneering program to support the reintegration of National Guard and Reserve members into society. They\u2019ve composed over one-third of the active duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, but have not had all the support systems of the regular military. Since I spoke with John Morris last year, interest in his reintegration model has grown, and a proposal to nationalize it is now before Congress. John Morris has been a chaplain since 1984. His insights into the soul of war have been shaped through two tours of active duty, including some of the worst fighting in Iraq. I was in Iraq in 2004. OK. I celebrated Easter, a very memorable Easter in 2004 in the city of Fallujah. So I was in Iraq in a dangerous place at a really terrible time. Mm-hmm. Tell me about Easter in Fallujah. I was at a camp with the Marines, the 1st Marine Division. I was supporting Army special operations soldiers, psychological operations soldiers, who were supporting the 1st Marine Division as they began to lay siege to and take down that city. At Camp Blue Diamond, it\u2019s the headquarters of the 1st Marine Division, and we had an early sunrise service, which actually was dangerous because the camp was being mortared occasionally. But, nonetheless, the Marines showed up in great strength, with a few Army personnel there. And I celebrated with Father Devine, the 1st Marine Division Roman Catholic priest. And it was particularly memorable because, you know, it was the only service I\u2019ve ever conducted where we were \u2014 we all knew that, by the end of the day, people who were worshipping in that service would no longer be on this planet. And so we talked about the hope of the Resurrection with a sense of fervency and urgency that I had never experienced before. The walls of the chapel were adorned with posters with the name of every Marine that had been wounded in the Anbar province, and every Marine that had been killed. And I couldn\u2019t help but think of that verse in Hebrew, as it talked about being surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. You know, we were, and we knew that very quickly many of us could be on that wall. So there was a sense of joy, and expectancy, and dread all meld together. All the Marines had their weapons. They were ready to go out on their mission. The place was packed. It was loud, as Marines can be. It was a participatory service. It was a beautiful, sacred privilege. And the service ended. And I went on my way to do my rounds of conducting Easter services for Marines and Army personnel all over that area. So it was an amazing time. A lot of Marines were killed, a lot of Army soldiers killed. That same day, after that? Yeah. That fight in Fallujah rolled on for five days, and then went down the road to a town called Ar Ramadi where 12 Marines were killed. That corridor there just was an incredibly bloody corridor. And, of course, that was a peak in the insurgency. And then it rolled into Sadr City, and then down into the holy city of Najaf. And my mission was following all of that. So the sense, however, of the privilege of doing ministry in a place like that was overwhelming. And it was really sustaining for me because I had the strong sense that I was where God wanted me to be. And I was empowered by Him to minister to men in desperate situations, both Iraqis and Americans. I had tremendous opportunity to meet with many, many Iraqis as I went with\u2026 How did that happen? How did you come to be speaking with Iraqis? Well, our psychological operation teams go right into villages and then towns. And I would often accompany those teams. And we traveled with translators. And so I had great opportunity to talk to the translators. And these were men who were risking their lives for their country\u2019s freedom. They faced certain death. During my time in Iraq, we had 10 translators killed. When they would leave to go home, they\u2019d be tracked down, hunted, and murdered. And they knew that that was the risk they were taking. So you were kind of the chaplain to those Iraqi translators as well, in effect? I didn\u2019t set out to serve that, but the men that I met were deeply spiritual men. They respected things of the spirit. And one of their dismays was that they didn\u2019t find many Americans that they considered to be spiritual. And there\u2019s something interesting about the Chaplain Corps of our military. That it\u2019s profoundly interfaith in the sense that not only there are chaplains from many traditions, but that you minister \u2014 you as a United, someone ordained in the United Methodist Church \u2014 you minister to whoever\u2019s there, right? I do minister to whoever comes, and try not to abuse my office in getting them to believe what I believe. And then I work hard to ensure that that soldier has what they need to worship in the way that they believe they need to worship. And I\u2019ll give you a great example. We learned that a rabbi would be in Iraq for Passover. And, you know, rabbis are in short supply in the Army. So I found four Jewish personnel \u2014 two Marines, two Army \u2014 way out in the Anbar province, and said, \u2018Hey, I will get you on a convoy and accompany you and get you in to Passover,\u2019 which was being held in the CPA Palace, now the embassy. And I had one of the most moving experiences of my life sitting in Saddam\u2019s palace, sharing with these Jews who, in their case, were not really well-versed in their own history, and saying, \u2018Hey, look, guys. You\u2019ve come full circle. Your people were here for thousands of years. And they endured so much, and you\u2019re back. And you\u2019re sitting in the palace of a man who persecuted your people. And when the psalmist said, you know, \u201CSing to us the songs of Zion by the river,\u201D this is where it was at, and you\u2019re back. And look, look around. The room\u2019s filled\u2026\u2019 By the rivers of Babylon. Yes. \u2018The room is filled with 400 of your compatriots.\u2019 And we had, all the coalition partners were represented by Jewish personnel, the CPA, the civilian contractors, all the branches of the military. I sat through the whole service, three, three and a half hours and, you know, walked out of there feeling like, \u2018I\u2019ve touched the hem of God here. I have been in something so movingly spiritual that I can\u2019t really capture it in words.\u2019 And when it was all said and done, one of the young soldiers said, \u2018You know, sir, I never thought a Christian would do this for me.\u2019 And\u2026 In a Muslim country. In a Muslim \u2014 yeah, just, I mean, God has a sense of humor. And that day He had a great laugh. You know, I love hearing that story because it\u2019s been so striking for me from the very beginning of our military involvement in Iraq, that it is this critical place of kind of sacred geography, of Genesis, also, of kind of the beginning of Abraham, of the beginning of so many pivotal Biblical stories. Sure. Sure. Well, there\u2019s no doubt about the historical significance. It\u2019s unbelievable. And there\u2019s a spiritual dynamic that I think often we, and I\u2019m speaking of American military forces, fail to take into account. And it\u2019s to our demise. You mean in that culture, in that land? That\u2019s part of it. And in this fight, which we call the global war on terrorism. We say that we understand that the people we\u2019re fighting are motivated by an ideology that\u2019s rooted in an aberrant view of a religion. It\u2019s a great line. But I\u2019ve often had to really be forceful with commanders that, \u2018You don\u2019t understand. These people are tapping into something in a spiritual realm. And if you fail to take it seriously, it doesn\u2019t matter how long we fight, we will not defeat them.\u2019 What does that mean for you? I mean, what are you wanting these commanders to do differently? Or how are you wanting them to think differently when you say that? It has several components to it, and I\u2019m going to be blunt. And I don\u2019t say this for effect; it\u2019s just a reality. We\u2019re in a war. But this is a war where you can\u2019t kill enough people to win because this has a spiritual motivation to it. You\u2019ve got to have more tools than kinetic energy. And that\u2019s how I talk to commanders because they understand kinetic energy as firing of a weapon system. That means we have to take seriously religious leaders. We have to take seriously the religious worldview of people. We have to think that when we fire that weapon and we miss, that round goes somewhere. And when it hits somebody else that\u2019s innocent, it has a ripple effect on a culture that takes seriously life and death, clan and family. That when we search mosques, it has an impact, whether the mosque was used as an armory, which I often saw that it was, or not. There is an impact. And then the other things that we have to take seriously, how do we care for the dead? These people have\u2026 You mean the Iraqi dead? Correct, Iraqi dead, Afghani dead, the insurgent fighters that come in from other countries who are Muslims. Do we understand their sacred rituals and rites for dealing with the dead? Do we understand the religious calendar of the area we\u2019re operating in and adhere to this? You know, Iraq has huge pilgrimages that the Shias have to make their way to Karbala and Najaf. You know, you got to take that seriously. And we do. I\u2019m not saying that we don\u2019t, but I\u2019m passionate\u2026 But it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re right. It needs a whole shift in worldview. Oh, it does. And we train military commanders to be excellent warriors. And they are. They\u2019re very lethal and very effective. But we don\u2019t train them about the spiritual dimension. We pay lip service to it. You know, \u2018Hey, religion\u2019s a part of culture. You got to be aware of that.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s great. But how aware are we really? You know, you\u2019re getting at something that I think about a lot, and that I think intersects a lot of my conversations with religious people, speaking about many different subjects. But where you\u2019re talking about it in the midst of war, an American military presence in a Muslim culture, it\u2019s intensified. And it is this, the power of religious energies of the spiritual aspect of life, which can be powerfully good, but when it\u2019s distorted, very powerfully destructive also. Yes, it can. Yes, it can. And you\u2019re exactly right. And we\u2019re in a day and an age where, you know, there\u2019s a toxic edge to some views of religious understanding, and it\u2019s costing people their lives. Chaplain Major John Morris. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Soul of War.\u201D Chaplain Morris is working now on programs to address the particular spiritual challenges of National Guard and Reserved personnel in and beyond combat. Currently, over 80,000 of them are mobilized worldwide, mostly in Afghanistan and Iraq. This is the highest level since World War II. And unlike career military personnel, they are offered little in the way of re-orientation and support in resuming their civilian lives. John Morris says this is a public health issue and a story that\u2019s been missing in the media. Here\u2019s the thing that we face in the Guard \u2014 the Army Guard and the Army Reserve, which is being used now in this war like it hasn\u2019t been used since World War II, massive call-ups, people uprooted from their lives. And we actually go to combat longer than the active-duty counterparts do. They go for six months to a year. We go for 18 months \u2014 six months of training, 12 months of combat. Now here\u2019s the disconnect: We take a citizen off the street of Minneapolis, and we turn them into a warrior, a person who, upon demand, without a split-second hesitation, will point a weapon at another human being and shoot them until they don\u2019t get up again. You don\u2019t just easily train people to do that. That is an amazing transformation. It takes six months to get a person ready to do that, then we put them in combat for 12 months. Then, in 300 hours, we can have them from their last mission back on the street in Minneapolis in their civilian clothes. There\u2019s a problem there. The active duty doesn\u2019t do that. They bring their soldiers back to bases, they have a transition period, they have programs, they watch their soldiers. We just release them. And how do you reverse from warrior back to citizen in 300 hours? It can\u2019t be done, and it\u2019s not being done well around the country. And so we\u2019re putting a speed bump there to help this process, and an educational component, and support component to try to help our soldiers. And that\u2019s where the spiritual dimension comes in. You know, and I want to ask you, as someone who is wanting to focus attention on the spiritual dimension, you\u2019re a religious person, a religious leader, and when you put it that bluntly, that we\u2019re training people to point a gun at another human being and kill them, you know, what happens to someone\u2019s spirit in that process? And how do you make sense of that? How do you justify that? Mm-hmm. Yeah, and that\u2019s a classic question. And I do put that very bluntly because we don\u2019t do anybody any service couching war in any language other than war language. I call it tricking soldiers into killing people. If we mask this language, we set them up to be further damaged because they\u2019re not mentally prepared for the horrible job we\u2019re giving them to do. And if we don\u2019t talk as a society about war with war language, then we\u2019re fooling ourselves about what we\u2019re all participating in, and we\u2019re underestimating the impact it will have on those that we\u2019re sending there and then on their families when they return. Now, how do I deal with the whole question of killing another human being? Well, not with great ease, and anybody worth their salt, I would pray, would be at dis-ease with the concept of sanctioning the taking of human life. Now, the way I deal with it with soldiers, I don\u2019t have a formula. But we are engaged in something that we believe, by our president and foreign policy, to be a needed task to combat a greater evil. We have people on the battlefield who want to take our lives. We have a great responsibility to discern who the enemy is and who isn\u2019t the enemy, and to use the proportionate amount of violence to address and kill our enemy, and to spare those who are innocent. And we cannot deny that when we take human life, it impacts us. When we go in after killing people and search them and find their photographs of their families, we have killed human beings. We haven\u2019t killed things or people that we\u2019ve managed to convince ourselves are robots. We\u2019ve killed humans. And I will tell you, dealing with combat veterans of all generations in this, I\u2019m proud to say that American soldiers are bothered by taking human life. We may have time periods on the battlefield where we are hardened, but when we come home and we have a chance to reflect, we don\u2019t come to peace easily, even though often, we know we were in clear-cut engagements with an enemy. The worst that we have to deal with is when we know we\u2019ve killed innocent people or our own soldiers due to the chaos of the battlefield. And that drives some soldiers mad. But, for all of them, it bruises their spirit. And this is where I, as a clergyman, plead for the help of the church. Because soldiers come looking for absolution and often find that the church is not a place they can come to, or they feel disassociated from it. And then where do they go? Right. You have said elsewhere that spiritual leaders, clergy and congregations are really often not equipped. And, you know, where is the training for this in our culture to be part of this healing of our military personnel when they come back home? Tell me about that. Tell me what you\u2019ve observed in terms of what, what is the problem there? It seems, you know, having been a parish pastor for 20 years while I served in the Guard and Reserve, I can observe the people that I associated with in my denomination. By and large, they came of age, either during the Vietnam era, or were instructed by the people who came of age during the Vietnam era, a time when we had a societal nervous breakdown, and when we did turn on the military. We understand, intuitively, we don\u2019t want to do that again. But I watch my colleagues wrestle with the dynamics of \u2018How do I separate the war from the warrior? And how do I deal with the divisive issue in my congregation? I don\u2019t want to appear to be promoting war.\u2019 That seems to be the default mode for most Christian clergy, and I think that\u2019s a good thing. \u2018I don\u2019t want to promote war, but I don\u2019t want to shame the warrior. But I don\u2019t know how to do either, so I just won\u2019t do anything.\u201D Now some go one direction or the other. Some say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m against this war, and I\u2019m not going to honor the warrior. I won\u2019t have an American flag in my sanctuary, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to let warriors know that they shouldn\u2019t participate in this.\u2019 And on the other end, you can wrap the flag around the gospel and say this is God\u2019s war. And I\u2019ve seen both. I\u2019m asking people to do the more nuanced of whatever your foreign policy opinion is, please share it. That\u2019s your role as a prophet. I have no problem with that. But in your congregation are men and women whose sons and daughters, or grandmas and grandpas, or fathers and mothers are off risking their lives. How do you tend to them? And how do you help that soldier come home? Big, big pastoral challenge. It seems to me that even in congregations where \u2014 and you\u2019re right, you know, the public debate tends not to be nuanced. No. At least the publicized debate. Sure. It seems to me that in congregations, where the choice is to support the war and to welcome our military personnel back as heroes, even there that healing might not take place because there might not be that nuanced acknowledgment still of what a difficult and damaging experience that is, even if it is deemed to be morally right. Yes, you\u2019re right. And we don\u2019t have a lot of rituals, and we need one for this. In our culture, hmm. Yeah. In Medieval days, in some parts of Europe, the priest would go with the soldiers, raised from the villages to go fight, and you know, hear their confession prior to going to battle, give them last rites, and send them to war. So that\u2019s a very stark psychology. \u2018Hey, you may die, so we need to make things right with God.\u2019 Then when they came home, they were stopped before they entered the village. The village went out to meet them. They were not allowed in the village. Stripped off their clothes that they had fought in, bathed, heard confession again, celebrated the Eucharist, and then allowed back in the village. Now, what were they saying there? \u2018You know, there needs to be some business done with God and with the community prior to allowing you to rejoin us. We need to leave the old out here.\u2019 I say we\u2019re in the Dr. Phil culture. Here\u2019s an ironic observation on this war in Afghanistan and Iraq. In terms of how it\u2019s been covered, yeah. Yeah. And it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s our culture today. We like to delve into people\u2019s personal lives and pain. That has a peculiar spiritual effect on combat veterans as well because heroism doesn\u2019t seem to be as valued in our culture, but having personal pain and trauma gets you notoriety. That\u2019s a real twist that\u2019s hard for people to come to grips with. People \u2014 soldiers once they\u2019re back here. Sure. And the military, you know, heroism\u2019s a sacrament. It\u2019s a virtue. It\u2019s something unbelievable to see somebody exhibit. And we honor it highly. And so what it tends to do is it alienates us even further. We\u2019re part of a subculture in America that values things the general culture doesn\u2019t seem to be as interested in. And that puzzles us, and so it creates, again, that sense of alienation, that \u2018Hey, where I was really most vital and alive was when I was with my combat buddies, and we were executing our mission. When I come back here, people want to treat me like a victim.\u2019 \u2018There must be something wrong with you, because you went to combat.\u2019 Right. Something that I\u2019ve noticed in this war, or in this \u2014 in these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2014 and I think this is part of the media\u2019s attempt to honor the people who are fighting \u2014 you\u2019ve had a lot of stories about the toll that it takes on their families for them to be away. Sure. Those are real traumas that are happening to people in our society. But, to me, I mean, and you\u2019ve kind of given me a word to describe what makes you uncomfortable about it, it is portraying military people and their families as victims. Well, I agree, and I often say this in our\u2026 You know what I\u2019m talking about? Sure. I often say this in our community reintegration training. Make \u2014 see if this resonates with what you just said. I say to people, you know, this is a volunteer army. This is not your father\u2019s army. Right. And it may shock you, as citizens, to know that the vast majority of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, who are going to war, chose to do this. And in fact, the vast majority in theater, while they don\u2019t like being away from home, they don\u2019t like the danger, they believe this is what the nation needs them to be doing. And we used to call that noble. And now, we don\u2019t seem to have a word for that. Back in the \u201980s, there was a term \u201Cweekend warrior,\u201D and there was a myth that said if you called the Guard and Reserve, they won\u2019t come. Well, you know, there hasn\u2019t been any mass desertions. There have not been any units that failed to come. That\u2019s an underreported story. In fact, there\u2019s been an incredible amount of self-sacrificing. Yeah. People have uprooted their lives. And what a lot of folks don\u2019t realize is we\u2019re sending from 17 to 57 to war. Seventeen hundred soldiers in Iraq today are over the age of 55. We\u2019re sending grandpa and son, father, son, mom and dad. This is an unusual time in American history, with this volunteer force. The 3,000 Minnesota Guard soldiers that are in Iraq today, 1,000 of them are on their second deployment since 9/11. That means they\u2019ve given up twice putting any roots down in a civilian career and in their family to serve in harm\u2019s way. I\u2019m awed to be around people like that, and I have a hard time conveying that to my fellow citizens, that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not victims, you know. We\u2019re willing volunteers.\u2019 Chaplain Major John Morris. This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, his observations on how war challenges the core tenets of a life of faith. There are, he says, atheists in foxholes. In the American Army these days, there are also, of course, Muslims and Wiccans and Buddhists. Our companion Web site, speakingoffaith.org, includes Chaplain Morris\u2019 essay on how members of faith congregations can help returning soldiers reintegrate with their communities. There\u2019s also an audio slide show of Major Morris describing his tour in Iraq.

Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CThe Soul of War.\u201D Chaplain Major John Morris is a veteran of Iraq, and he leads a pioneering initiative of the Minnesota National Guard called Beyond the Yellow Ribbon. I spoke with him in 2006 about the spiritual impact of military service on soldiers and their communities. Now a model for a national program, Beyond the Yellow Ribbon is teaching clergy and counselors how to deal with the mental and spiritual needs of returning soldiers and their families. The Department of Defense recently revealed that one-third of returning soldiers report psychological concerns, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Among members of the National Guard, that figure jumps to 49 percent, and problems rise significantly after repeated deployments. John Morris is just as concerned with the challenge of readjustment for the remaining 50 to 70 percent. When we say mental health, my experience is most of the duress that I see in soldiers coming out of combat is marital issues. Seventy percent of the military is married. You leave your spouse and your family for 18 months, you\u2019re going to have problems when you come home. The strongest of marriages will be tested sorely. When you leave your children and try to reconnect, and they\u2019ve grown two years in your absence, you\u2019re going to have some significant challenges. When you try to re-engage with a job, and I\u2019m speaking about the Guard and the Reserve now, that will cause you mental duress\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026on top of the agitation that you\u2019re going to experience having been in another culture. Basically, I tell people, if you live in a forward operating base in Afghanistan or Iraq, you\u2019re in something like a medium-security to maximum-security prison. Anybody that\u2019s been in prison for 18 months and gets released is going to have some issues that are going to cause stress. Then you throw the culture. You\u2019ve left the Middle East and returned to the United States, then you throw the loss of camaraderie. And then on top of that you throw all the battlefield skills that you\u2019ve learned to survive, don\u2019t translate\u2026 That you have to unlearn. \u2026you\u2019re going to have duress. But the legions of soldiers throughout all conflicts come, work through those things, leap forward in life in a tremendous way. OK. And, you know, I wanted to ask you about this. I do think there\u2019s a general sense that, you know, we talk about the great generation, World War II. There was a war that we think of as morally right, no ambiguity, really. You can take fault with some missions and actions. Mm-hmm. Sure, and they came home and lived happily ever after. Right. Now did\u2026 Well, thanks for raising that. Is that because we didn\u2019t talk about these problems back then? Yeah. Right on. I\u2019ll prove it to you. OK. Let me read you something here from a memoir. OK. From my wife\u2019s great uncle, who lives in Lake Crystal, Minnesota. Great guy. He served 152 days in combat with the 91st Infantry Division, fought up the boot of Italy \u2019til the last day in hostilities with the Germans in Italy. This gentleman writes: \u201CCombat is a traumatic experience. After all these years, even though my senses are not as keen, I can still close my eyes and see and hear and smell the battle and sense the death and fear that surrounded me. My discharge from the Army was anti-climactic. I was 20 years old, but in some ways, I was an old man. I had been in places and seen things that few people see in a lifetime. I wanted to forget, but I couldn\u2019t. I had trouble sleeping. I was nervous, confused and angry. I had trouble concentrating, and I had no idea on what to do to earn a living. In today\u2019s world, I supposed I\u2019d be diagnosed as having PTSD. However, we were told to go home, forget about it, get a job. My parents encouraged me to attend college. But with my mental state at the time, I knew it wouldn\u2019t work. During the next three years, you might say I was a bum. I drove a flower delivery truck, dismantled machinery, worked nights in a 24-hour truck stop, was a molder in a foundry, and went broke operating a restaurant.\u201D Now that is a World War II, greatest generation, dogface soldier. Not a Vietnam vet. No. No. We didn\u2019t have, you know, he was like the, his peers of the day. They didn\u2019t have a language to discuss it. So many people had experienced it that they silently bore the agony. The interesting thing that the VA tells me \u2014 and I work closely with the VA vet centers and VA psychologists \u2014 they tell me that since 9/11, the biggest upsurge in customers for them is World War II-generation veterans\u2026 Really? \u2026who finally are coming in with idle time on their hands, like this gentlemen who wrote four years of his combat experience down in a book. They\u2019re coming and looking for help. So, yeah, they had the same problems dealing with the trauma of war that this generation will have. I think this generation, we\u2019ve got more resources for them. And one of the purposes of my program is to connect them early with those resources so they don\u2019t have to walk with this for 60 years, so they can bring this to the surface and process it, draw strength from it, and move on with their lives. Hmm. I want to ask you, we started here, but I want to sort of come back to this territory of war and faith and the soul. There\u2019s this phrase, \u201CThere are no atheists in foxholes.\u201D Mm-hmm. What do you think of that phrase? It\u2019s not true. There are atheists in foxholes. Stephen Mansfield\u2019s written a great book called The Faith of the American Soldier. And he chronicles what he saw in Iraq, the same time I was there. I think he got it very, very well. What I saw in Iraq, and I ended up my tour of duty in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. But what I saw in my combat experience \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen through my 22 years \u2014 is on the battlefield, using crude numbers, a third of the soldiers were men and women of faith, growing in their faith or coming to a new understanding of their faith. A third of the soldiers were indifferent or fatalistic. And that\u2019s, that religion on the battlefield bears a lot of looking at. The other third were either indifferent or jettisoning their faith. OK. And many would say to me, very bluntly, \u2018I\u2019ve lost my faith. I saw my buddy get blown away,\u2019 or \u2018I was involved in a firefight that killed innocent people. And if there\u2019s a good God, He wouldn\u2019t let that to happen. So I do not want to believe anymore.\u2019 The guys I worried about, that were fatalistic, were people who had really hardened in their soul. And they had what I would call the thousand-yard stare, the classic combat look of a fatigued soldier. And they were droning through each day not thinking too far ahead and not being retrospectful. To look ahead meant you had to have hope for future. To look within meant you had to deal with the pain and the challenge. Too much energy to expend that, you know, to do that, so they wouldn\u2019t do that. And they had seen so much chaos, and war is chaos. You could do everything right and still die. And you see that on a regular basis. And that\u2019s so counter to American philosophy where the good guys win in the end. And if you do everything right, you\u2019re rewarded. Right. At least, the movie philosophy. Sure. And here, you know, a guy that\u2019s barefoot, with an AK-47, can kill the best and the bravest soldier, or a mortar round can fire inexplicably into your PX and kill innocent people. It\u2019s chaotic. And that chaos seems to so harden people into saying, \u2018I can\u2019t think about transcendent things. Nobody\u2019s in control. The only thing I can control is the space around me right now. And whatever is is. And whatever will be will be. And I\u2019m not going to worry about it, so don\u2019t bother me with anything transcendent or eternal.\u2019 Now the thing that really throws the, a wrench into all of this is being shot at by people who were praying a few minutes earlier in a sacred place, and who may be shooting you out of that sacred place. Hmm. That really hardens some people to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what kind of God you all are talking about, but I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with any kind of God that uses the sacred to condone this. And so I don\u2019t want to deal with any of you people that have anything to do with religion, because you guys are causing the wars of the world today.\u2019 So you meet a real mix, just like you do on any street in America. The American military\u2019s no different. Everything from the atheist to the devout Orthodox Jew to the Wiccan to the Pagan to everything in between. It\u2019s all there. The unique thing about this war, I think, that our forefathers and mothers would not recognize is this generation of soldiers will do their own religion and not wait for the chaplain to organize it for them. Right. Right. So it\u2019s not unusual to find Bible studies, Qur\u2019anic studies, prayer groups. People doing it and not, they\u2019re not asking for permission. They\u2019re exercising their freedom. It\u2019s a wonderful thing to see. So, you\u2019ll have a chapel on every one of these forward operating bases, and a chaplain staff in the chapel, but you might not have big attendance. But don\u2019t let that fool you about the religious fervor on that operating base. It just may not be in an organized variety. There\u2019s someone named Gordon Cosby. Have you heard of him? He\u2019s a Baptist. He was a Baptist minister and a chaplain in World War II, and he founded the Church of the Saviour in Washington, DC. I just know the name; I don\u2019t know him well. And he wanted to found kind of a new kind of church, because as a chaplain in World War II, he said he experienced that what churches should have been \u2014 and he was mostly with Christian American soldiers, I suppose, at that time. He felt churches should have been places where people were prepared to face death\u2026 Yes. \u2026and to face the large transcendent issues of life and death that they were confronted with in battle, and they weren\u2019t. What you\u2019re describing is, you know, and now, there are many more people who we would called \u201Cunchurched\u201D in our culture, but, oh, I think it\u2019s really interesting that what you\u2019re describing also is people taking that spiritual quest into their own hands. You bet. You bet. And it\u2019s true of American soldiers. It\u2019s really fascinating. Sure. And so, you know, my first time with the military, into the Middle East, was in 1996, and I was up on the Iraqi border, waiting for Saddam to reinvade Kuwait, and I personally gave out over 150 Qur\u2019ans. People inquiring, \u2018What do Muslims believe?\u2019 And hey, look, and I should say they were English translations of the Qur\u2019an. But \u2018Here, you can read this for yourself.\u2019 I passed out Arabic translations and said, \u2018If you really want to get to the essence here, you\u2019re going to have to learn Arabic.\u2019 But that\u2019s the American soldier searching. OK? And I passed out thousands of Bibles and Jewish prayer books, and that\u2019s the role of the chaplain: Resource people so that they can inquire. I\u2019ve been called \u201Cfather.\u201D I can\u2019t \u2014 if I had a dime every time, I\u2019d be able to retire today. You know, all the denominations come to your services, and we set aside a lot of things. And I often think about the picture of the animals on the Serengeti when there\u2019s a flood, and they\u2019re all on the island together, predator and prey. Well, you know, combat does that. Hey, we don\u2019t have time to worry about the fine distinctions that divide us. Chaplain Major John Morris. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Soul of War.\u201D John Morris is now working with National Guard and Reserve veterans. He says that the nature of the current military action in Iraq intensifies the spiritual disconnect that the experience of war always creates. Highly publicized atrocities committed there by U.S. soldiers, such as the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, both reveal and compound that. And I was outside Abu Ghraib when those things, those horrible pictures hit the international media. And I\u2019ll tell you, men were moved to revulsion because we\u2019re not that kind of people, and that isn\u2019t the depths that we sink to. And it isn\u2019t where we want to go morally or spiritually. And to think that there were among us people that did that, I think those things cause a numbness of the soul. I think another thing that affects us is many soldiers will patrol, and patrol for a year, see their buddies maimed, wounded and killed and never see the enemy. And come home with a sense of \u2018I didn\u2019t do my job, I was\u2026\u2019 Because it\u2019s the insurgency? It \u2014 yes. They\u2026 So they\u2019re not facing, you know, soldiers in uniforms. They\u2019re invisible. They blow a bomb up from, you know, half a mile away. You never \u2014 they don\u2019t come out to fight you. Right. And the warrior sense of \u2018I\u2019m here to protect, I\u2019m here to defend, and I never got to do my job, but my buddy got wounded and killed. I failed in some way. I\u2019m frustrated.\u2019 I \u2014 the sense of justice, where is justice. These are the real things that we wrestle with. And then to see an enemy that\u2019s so wanton in the use of innocent people to perpetuate their gain, it\u2019s in a category we have a hard time comprehending. So, you know, you\u2019ve used the word chaos with me several times, and anarchy, and this fact that you are up against good and evil, including the good and evil within yourself. I think civilians are in that situation, also, in a war zone, which touches on the big dynamics of religious faith and of religious traditions. You knew at 23 or something that you were called to be a chaplain, and to be a military chaplain. And, you know, how do all these things you know and all these things you\u2019ve experienced in yourself and in others, how do they, can you talk a little bit about how that changes your understanding of some of the great, big tenets of Christianity? Well, let\u2019s talk about love your enemies. That\u2019s sorely tested in combat. I think, in a very chilling way, I came to the abyss of hate in Fallujah. The body parts of four Americans charred and hanging off a bridge over the Euphrates brought me to a point where I could truly sense myself going down a vortex of hate, that in a city, people were harbored who were that debased. And so at that point, I felt that I was crossing a line to say, \u2018Yes, these people\u2019s time on the planet is over, they need to leave. There\u2019s no second chance, there\u2019s no other form of justice. They have forfeited all rights to humanness.\u2019 That was a chilling, chilling moment for me because I knew I was entering a new territory. And once you cross this line, there\u2019s no coming back. When do I become like them? I found myself fueled with a sense of hatred that I could easily have said, you know, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m God\u2019s wrath. We are God\u2019s wrath. This needs to be taken care of.\u2019 The only thing that pulled me back from that was the power of the Holy Spirit, all the Christian disciplines, and my sense of understanding that, wait a minute, as much as I abhor everything that\u2019s done, and as much as I believe what was done was evil, and that if these people don\u2019t come out and surrender, there\u2019s only one alternative, that is to go in and kill them or apprehend them. I knew I could not cross that line and say, \u2018OK, God\u2019s on my side, and here we go.\u2019 No, this is chaos, this is human fallenness to the max, and we\u2019re using the most brutal tool of human society, the military, to solve a very, very terrible problem. And this isn\u2019t God here, this is fallen human beings. So God help me and have mercy on me. I\u2019m a part of something like this, and I prayed that it wouldn\u2019t be, but here we are. Save me from becoming a debased, immoral human being. And save my soldiers as well. One of the things that I see as a challenge here is how does the community accept its moral obligation to reintegrate veterans and their families? And I\u2019m treading lightly here because I don\u2019t want to be perceived as laying guilt on people, but what we learned from the Vietnam conflict is, if the community shames and shuns, it has a disastrous public health effect that ends up affecting all of us. But we haven\u2019t figured out what our moral role is here, and it\u2019s often put back on the military. \u2018Hey, you fix these people so they can come home and live peacefully among us, and we\u2019ll be quiet and they\u2019ll be quiet.\u2019 Well, we can\u2019t do that. So we\u2019ve alluded to this, how does the church do it, but how does the greater community do this beyond paying our taxes? I think citizens are wrestling with that and looking for guidance. What do I do? Do I say \u201Cthank you\u201D to a veteran? Yeah, that\u2019s a beautiful thing to do. But what else do I do? Well, how do I make space in my workplace when a veteran returns, for them to make a successful transition? How do I provide for their family while they\u2019re gone and their children and help make space for them to reconnect? How do I help the soldier learn how to reconnect with their child? How do I help the child deal with a soldier who\u2019s different than when they left? How do I help that spouse who\u2019s trying to hold it all together or that grandparent who\u2019s raising that soldier\u2019s kids? These are community issues that I find the community saying, \u2018We didn\u2019t think about this, we want to think about this, we need some guidance. Where do we go to learn how to do this?\u2019 And I am begging for the community, let\u2019s talk quickly, because there\u2019s no end in sight to veterans returning, and how we help them reconnect sets us up for a successful, healthy future or for lingering problems and wounds from this war. I\u2019m thinking about how you said to me that the trauma, the spiritual and mental and physical trauma of war has always been there, but we didn\u2019t have a language for it\u2026 Correct. \u2026until these last couple of decades. And what you\u2019re, what you\u2019re talking about here is that the entire society needs a language also for being part of that healing. Sure. And in the past, we\u2019ve attempted this by doing things like Veterans Day, Memorial Day. Right. Those are great rituals that brought this issue to the surface for us to wrestle with once again. Obviously, we need to preserve those. But because we\u2019re using Guard and reservists so much, how do we build into our communities, beyond the parade and the welcome home, a long-term effort to help them come all the way home? This involves social services and educators, doctors, lawyers, law enforcement. Every sector of the society will be touched by us and our families. So this is a long-term effort for people who tend to have a microwave attention span. OK. And I often say it\u2019s like recovering from Hurricane Katrina. It won\u2019t happen in a year. Neither will recovering from war. Mm-hmm. And we have people coming home now every day, every day. Sure we do. And we will for years and years to come. This is with us for the rest of our lives and on into our children\u2019s lives, this homecoming of veterans. So let\u2019s get it right this time. Chaplain Major John Morris.
