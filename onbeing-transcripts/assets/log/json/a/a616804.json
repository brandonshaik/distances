  "fullText": "A single voice of integrity can be a window into many worlds. Layli Long Soldier is a writer, a mother, a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation. She has a way of opening up this part of her life, and of American life, to inspire self-searching and tenderness. And I had no idea, until I discovered Layli Long Soldier that the U.S. government offered an official apology to Native peoples in 2009. But it was done so quietly, with no ceremony, that it was practically a secret. Now, Standing Rock is in our midst as a new shorthand for layers of history we scarcely know how to talk about. Layli Long Soldier\u2019s lyrical first book, WHEREAS, explores the freedom real apologies can bring \u2014 and offers entry points for us all to histories that are not merely about the past. All of them had to be within living memory. I really wanted it to be grounded in the now, at least within my own lifetime. And I wanted as much as possible to avoid this sort of nostalgic portraiture of a Native life, my life. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. WHEREAS received the 2016 Whiting Award. Layli Long Soldier\u2019s mother was from Idaho and her father from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. She mostly grew up in the Four Corners Region of Arizona, where she now teaches English at Din\u00E9 College of the Navajo people, the first tribally-controlled college in the United States. A couple of years ago, I interviewed Sitting Bull\u2019s great-grandson Ernie LaPointe. It was as I was preparing for that interview that I first learned that it wasn\u2019t until 1978 that the American Indian Religious Freedom Act gave the Lakota and other tribes the right to perform their sacred rituals and ceremonies, that these things had been decreed barbarous and demoralizing in 1883 in law. It occurs to me that you, more or less, grew up in the aftermath of that shift, although probably when it was still in transition. I\u2019m just curious about that, if that\u2019s something you were aware of. Oh, yeah. It\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ve been aware of. I can\u2019t speak for all of my generation, and I cannot speak for all Lakota people. So I have Lakota family who is Christian. But certainly, for me, it\u2019s the more traditional teachings that are important to me, as I\u2019ve said before. But even learning about those things, it\u2019s something that has come slowly because you have to find the right people and the right family members who have that kind of knowledge to share. There\u2019s a great diversity within our own communities, and I think that has a lot to do with the history. Right? Yeah. So people had to pray somehow. Right. That Christian aspect of things is also part of that lineage, of that history, even if it\u2019s a nourishing thing for people now. I\u2019m very intrigued with the language that people use \u2014 that other people use when they describe you. And these are both sections from the Whiting Awards citation. \u201CLayli Long Soldier is the poet-architect\u201D \u2014 that\u2019s poet-hyphen-architect \u2014 \u201Cin the arena of witness and longing.\u201D Are those words specifically \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s how somebody else has described you, but are those words meaningful for you? Do you know what they\u2019re getting at? And what does that mean to you? To me, I don\u2019t know. In some ways, I think that\u2019s language that comes from an outward gaze. The idea of the witness is not something that I sit down to the page with. You\u2019re not assuming the persona of the witness in any kind of conscious way. Yeah. For sure. What about \u201Clonging?\u201D \u201CLonging\u201D \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if \u2014 again, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a word I relate to because longing for me conjures up feelings maybe of nostalgia, both of which are things that I try very hard to avoid. But maybe there is a sense of longing in there that I haven\u2019t myself recognized. Talk a little bit about what you avoid in the notion of nostalgia. Well, let\u2019s say with the WHEREAS pieces, which are a response to the national apology to Native Americans. I\u2019ve often said that I felt like this was a project of constraints. So when I sat down to work on this response, there were a lot of constraints that I placed on myself. And one of those was that I wanted all of the pieces to be written, number one, through first person, \u201CI.\u201D But number two, all of them had to be within living memory. I did not want to jump back 100 years. I think, so often, that\u2019s really a temptation to do when it comes to anything that has to do with Native issues, Native rights, or history. And so I really wanted it to be grounded in the now, at least within my own lifetime. And I wanted as much as possible to avoid this sort of nostalgic portraiture of a Native life, or life \u2014 my life. Well, to me, this also is an expression, perhaps, of this idea of dual citizenship. And it seems to me this work takes on both sides of you if \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right way to say it. Like, you\u2019ve written, \u201CI am a citizen of the United States and an enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, meaning I am a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation\u2014and in this dual citizenship I must work, I must eat, I must art, I must mother, I must friend, I must listen, I must observe, constantly I must live.\u201D Tell me how \u2014 so this congressional resolution of apology to Native Americans happened in 2009. I had never heard of it until I sat down to prepare to interview you. And I don\u2019t think you heard about it at the time. Is that right? How did you start? How did your attention come to be trained on this? Yeah. I hadn\u2019t heard about the apology until months later. I think it was signed in December 2009. And it was sometime in the spring, I think, of 2010 I heard about it, several months later. And I was personally really surprised that I hadn\u2019t heard about it before. Part of the reason I hadn\u2019t was because it was so quiet. And there really was not a lot of risk taken in how it was delivered. Well, it was enacted as part of the Defense Appropriations Act of 2009, which is a little confusing and not necessarily where we would look. And it\u2019s interesting to me because there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 I feel like \u2014 just recently, in American culture, we\u2019ve started to entertain some new kinds of language like \u201Ctruth and reconciliation.\u201D And is that something we might think about with Native Americans, with slavery, or reparations, or words like \u201Credemption?\u201D And then there is this \u2014 here\u2019s, tucked away is this thing, this resolution that was passed but never really spoken aloud, never really offered publicly. I mean, I\u2019m just going to read a little bit of it because probably other people haven\u2019t heard of it either. This is just the beginning: \u201CTo acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the federal government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States.\u201D It talks about the fact that \u201CNative Peoples inhabited the\u2026present-day United States\u2026for thousands of years before the arrival of people of European descent.\u201D That they \u201Chonored, protected, and stewarded this land we cherish.\u201D And then it says, \u201CWhereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new chapter in the history of the Native Peoples.\u201D And then it continues to \u2014 \u201Cwhereas,\u201D \u201Cwhereas,\u201D \u201Cwhereas,\u201D and \u201Cwhereas.\u201D So you discovered this and \u2014 yeah. What was your reaction? I think \u2014 well, first of all, what motivated me to even respond to the apology was the delivery. So that\u2019s the heart of it. Or I should say the non-delivery of the apology. But then I went online, and I read the apology, and then I was like, \u201COh my gosh, the language \u2014 it\u2019s so careful.\u201D It\u2019s so carefully crafted. I mean, my goodness, these guys are poets. I mean, very astute and very aware of what each phrase \u2014 how do I say it \u2014 what each phrase may carry, the implication of each phrase. So even the phrasing of \u201Cthe arrival of Europeans opened a new chapter for Native People\u201D \u2014 that\u2019s crazy. It wasn\u2019t opening a new chapter. That\u2019s almost poetry. I mean, that\u2019s a very interesting way to look at what happened. And going further into the document, just the idea \u2014 for example, they never mention genocide. Things are phrased as \u201Cconflicts,\u201D \u201Clives were taken on both sides,\u201D and things like that. \u201CBoth took innocent lives, including those of women and children.\u201D I mean, they do say \u201Cthe infamous Trail of Tears\u201D and \u201CLong Walk.\u201D But yeah. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s very spare and careful. Right. I mentioned this to a group of students recently at the University of Washington, but I\u2019ll mention it here as well. I was watching this really nice video, a little talk by Faith Spotted Eagle. She\u2019s Dakota, and she was the only Native woman to receive a vote from the electoral college in this last election. 2016 election? Yeah. She\u2019s an amazing, beautiful woman, wonderful speaker too. Anyway, I was watching this video, this little talk she was giving, and she was talking about the idea of discussing history, discussing some of these traumas that have happened. And she was saying, for Native people, talking about these things \u2014 it\u2019s important to a process of healing. And for me, I think it\u2019s not just healing. I would add to that a sense of justice, being heard. And then on the other hand, she said for non-Native people, hearing and listening to these narratives, these histories, and engaging in a conversation, it is not about guilt, and it\u2019s not about shame. It is about, in her words, I think she said \u201Cfreedom from denial.\u201D It allows a liberation. So I think that that\u2019s really, maybe, what was important to me in this work. And I didn\u2019t want to jump back 100, 150, 200 years. I didn\u2019t want to jump back to Wounded Knee or Sand Creek. I wanted to say, this is what it\u2019s like here and now in my own lifetime. This is not history. This is not old history. It\u2019s present in my life, in my child\u2019s life, my daughter\u2019s life. Someone recently asked me \u2014 a little bit embarrassing \u2014 they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter in them. And I was like, \u201COh my gosh, that\u2019s so true.\u201D And I was a little embarrassed just because I didn\u2019t want to seem obsessed. But I think that that was important to me as well. That was a part of\u2026 It\u2019s not just \u2014 not the past. It\u2019s the present and the future. It\u2019s the world we\u2019re creating. That\u2019s right. Exactly. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the poet Layli Long Soldier. I feel like we\u2019re talking about something very specific, but we\u2019re speaking in a moment of time of incredible fracture. And there\u2019s a lot of apologizing that hasn\u2019t happened. And we\u2019re actually building up a lot of things up that are going to have to be apologized for. So one thing I find really interesting that you do in WHEREAS is \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re not only talking about history; you\u2019re also bringing in human intelligence from life about what an apology is and how \u2014 when apologies are done well. I mean, these are things that neuroscientists are studying too. Just what you just said. I mean, they can now watch someone give a real apology and have it received and have it start changing things in their brain. Really? Yeah. I didn\u2019t know that. But it has to be sincere, right? And there\u2019s eye contact. And so you register that. Anyway, so you wrote in the beginning \u2014 actually the beginning of your response \u2014 \u201CWHEREAS when offered an apology, I watch each movement, the shoulders / high or folding, tilt of the head, both eyes down or straight through.\u201D I don\u2019t know \u2014 I hope I \u2014 \u201CI listen for cracks in knuckles or in the word choice, what is it that / I want? To feel and mind you I feel from the senses.\u201D Mm-hmm. Yeah. Exactly. This feels like really important deliberation. This is something we need to learn to do together as a people, in that part of your citizenship. Yeah. There\u2019s the physical presence, the energy. That is important. But on a national scale, I mean, it\u2019s also not just a personal apology. So there\u2019s things that are bigger than us, bigger than having just, let\u2019s say, a family member sit down next to me and apologize. At a national level, there\u2019s a lot more that goes with it. When I was writing this response, I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world, national apologies. One of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada. To the First Nations people. To the First Nations. Right. On the boarding school, the residential schools for what happened there and the taking of their children and so on. And that apology was read out loud. It was like a verbal speech. It was transmitted through their national television, and it had a very different quality. There was a very different quality to the language and the pacing of that apology. I always remember there was this one little short interview with an elder Native woman, and I can\u2019t remember her tribe. But in any case, so they asked her if things had changed, and she said, in her opinion, no. Things had not really changed. But she said \u2014 in just very, very simple terms, she said, \u201CYou know, if you want things to change, all you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties and doing what you said you would do.\u201D But I think there has to be a kind of trust building in order for any kind of apology to be effective, whether it\u2019s interpersonal or at a national level. I mean, one of the things you pointed out is that \u2014 and this was President Obama who signed this \u2014 that it was signed on a weekend. It was not read aloud. There was no ceremony. And there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it. And that ceremony is an important way in tribal culture to make something meaningful or to signify that something has meaning. I think it\u2019s important in tribal culture, but I think we have ceremonies all the time at the White House. It\u2019s in American culture too, right? Right. Yeah. It seems like there\u2019s all kinds of ceremonies going on over there at the White House. You know? Here\u2019s Layli Long Soldier reading some lines from her book WHEREAS: \u201CI did not desire in childhood to be a part of this but desired most of all to be a part. A piece combined with others to make up a whole. Some but not all of something. In Lakota, it\u2019s hank\u00E9, a piece or part of anything. Like the creek trickling behind my aunt\u2019s house where Uncle built her a bridge to cross from bank to bank, not far from a grassy clearing with three tipis, a place to gather\u2026I think of Plains winds snowdrifts ice and limbs the exposure and when I slide my arms into a wool coat and put my hand to the doorknob, ready to brave the sub-zero dark, someone says be careful out there always consider the snow your friend. Think badly of it, snow will burn you. I walk out remembering that for millennia we have called ourselves Lakota meaning friend or ally. This relationship to the other. Some but not all. Still our piece to everything.\u201D You can listen again and share this conversation with Layli Long Soldier through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring the perspective and poetry of Layli Long Soldier of the Oglala Lakota Nation. She has a way of opening up this part of her life, and of American life, that inspires self-searching and tenderness. She\u2019s the author of WHEREAS, a book of innovative poetry written as a contemporary response to the little-publicized congressional resolution of \u201CApology to Native Peoples,\u201D which was tucked inside the 2010 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. While you were writing this, Standing Rock is in the public eye, in the public imagination, this kind of ongoing drama. One thing you\u2019ve said about that is how intrigued you were about the community, the tribal community taking a position of remaining prayerful, of having that be ceremony, no weapons. And in some ways, I think, struggling with people who were coming to be in solidarity, but that being the position that the Standing Rock elders took. Right. And what should I say about that? Well, I\u2019m just curious about how you are watching that, have watched that. And how does it flow into this other exchange you\u2019ve been having by way of just thought and poetry with the large picture of this history and this struggle still to reconcile this history. It\u2019s kind of funny. Yesterday, I just had an interview with someone else, and we were talking about this idea of prayer. And so it\u2019s something that I\u2019m \u2014 I want to be really careful in talking about because I certainly don\u2019t want to come across like some new agey type person or some guru or something. But I think that \u2014 I have thought a lot about, both at a community level and on a personal level, this idea of this prayer being central to an ability to enact, even to take \u2014 how do I call \u2014 how would I say it? I almost want to say a prayerful enaction. I don\u2019t know. No, those are not the right words. But I think what I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot is \u2014 at Standing Rock, I have a few friends there, and how firm that community has been on keeping prayer as central to everything that they do. And I think that\u2019s something very beautiful and unique that Standing Rock has offered to the world of resistance. And that\u2019s not to say that other movements have not had prayer at the center of what they do either. No, but you\u2019re right. It\u2019s \u2014 even that word \u201Cresistance\u201D which is very much entered the lexicon right now. And not very often \u2014 I\u2019m not hearing it attached to prayer in other contexts. I mean, the other thing about that is that it was really in reading you saying this about the community taking a position and remaining prayerful, I realized that it was true and that it had come through in what I knew, but it\u2019s not prioritized in, like, coverage, right? It\u2019s not the headline. And so I think it\u2019s so important for you to say that, to speak that, for people to hear that too and be looking for that because Standing Rock is going to be with us. Right. And I think that \u2014 yeah. Every movement in every community, they have their own culture, their own values that sort of propel the action that they take to create change. I don\u2019t know if many people are aware of that, how important prayer is to Lakota life. But I always get a kick out of it. I had a nephew who was complaining to one of my cousins, my sister, and he was saying, \u201CIt\u2019s hard to be Lakota. All we do is pray, pray, pray all the time.\u201D So it\u2019s like \u2014 yeah. I just got a kick out of that. So it is a very real thing, and so it is something that I have really appreciated and loved seeing how that really influenced every step that the community took, I felt. And it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve heard from people who went up to Standing Rock. It was why I think so many people had a good experience there because there was that prayer and that sense of connection, that community. And it\u2019s different. And all kinds of religious figures, all kinds of religious leaders also gathering around with their prayers. Yeah. Ultimately, yeah. I don\u2019t know how you feel about the language of \u201CNative American spirituality,\u201D but I find it dangerous. I worry about it being thrown around and appropriated. Yeah, that doesn\u2019t mean a thing, actually. It doesn\u2019t mean a thing. No. I mean, listen, the thing is there are over 560 federally recognized tribes. And that\u2019s just federally recognized. There are many more that are not recognized, who are \u2014 many of them right now are seeking recognition. But the point is is all of us are different, and all of us have beliefs and ways that are particular to who we are as a people. So Lakota beliefs are very different than, let\u2019s say, where I live here in the Southwest from Pueblo, some of my friends from Santa Clara, Pueblo, let\u2019s say, or Hopi friends or Din\u00E9 friends. I mean, all of us \u2014 our traditions and our ways are all so, so different, our stories. And they\u2019re also so connected to the land that we come from. There\u2019s not a separation. It\u2019s connected. So \u201CNative American spirituality\u201D is just an awful term. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s so broad and \u2014 yeah. Abstract. Yeah. And it can be very, very superficial and out of context. I think one of the most striking sentences that I\u2019ve read or heard in the context of what\u2019s going on at Standing Rock is \u2014 I should\u2019ve written it down \u2014 but one of the elders or maybe the chief saying, \u201CWater is not a resource; it is the source of life.\u201D And that is a statement of fact. It\u2019s just \u2014 we never \u2014 it\u2019s not a way we say it or think about it. And it\u2019s such \u2014 the whole drama, really, is such an interesting \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s so many things, but if you look at that sentence, it\u2019s an amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand something like what is water, and how a word like \u201Cresource\u201D that gets thrown around \u2014 and I throw it around all the time too like crazy \u2014 it\u2019s, like, one of the big words now \u2014 can dehumanize us and be a way into belittling a source of life. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, all of these things \u2014 first of all, I really \u2014 I feel like I have to \u2014 I\u2019ll constantly put out disclaimers before I ever talk on some of these issues because \u2014 I just \u2014 I\u2019m so wary of sounding like I\u2019m talking for all Lakota people and all Native people, and I\u2019m certainly not an expert on any of these issues. But it is \u2014 again, it goes back to this idea of relationship. And seeing it in that way \u2014 even just for example, one of my friends posted something really funny on Facebook this morning, I think. And she was reminding people \u2014 what was \u2014 I think \u2014 red willow. This is a season for getting red willow. And she was saying, \u201CNow, everybody be careful and don\u2019t take more than you need. And leave the plant \u2014 allow the plant to stay alive for the next year.\u201D So it is always like \u2014 even just things like that, little Facebook posts or what have you. I mean, it\u2019s still alive, this awareness. Right. A sensibility. A sensibility of connection. You don\u2019t see the red willow as a resource \u2014 there you are \u2014 something you just take from. It is something you take from, but you do it respectfully. And the same applies, of course, to water and this source of life. I wonder \u2014 you mentioned a little while ago that you do talk about your daughter a lot in your poetry and\u2026 I know. And I talk about my children in my show. I wondered if you would read \u2014 and maybe this will put you at ease about \u2014 because I\u2019m not \u2014 you\u2019re not speaking for \u2014 you\u2019re just speaking for yourself. But a single voice of integrity and searching is a window into a world in a way that often asking somebody to represent a group, in fact, is not. There\u2019s this part in WHEREAS \u2014 there\u2019s the part where \u2014 I didn\u2019t write the page \u2014 \u201CWHEREAS her birth signaled the responsibility as mother to teach what it is to be Lakota.\u201D Do you want to read that? Just the like the\u2026 Oh. OK. Let\u2019s see. Let me find it. OK. Or maybe I\u2019ll read the first two. They seem kind of connected. That\u2019s fine. Yeah. \u201CWHEREAS her birth signaled the responsibility as mother to teach what it is to be Lakota, therein the question: what did I know about being Lakota? Signaled panic, blood rush my embarrassment. What did I know of our language but pieces? Would I teach her to be pieces. Until a friend comforted, don\u2019t worry, you and your daughter will learn together. Today she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean and straight to share a song in Din\u00E9, her father\u2019s language. To sing she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch her be in multiple musics. At a ceremony / to honor the Din\u00E9 nation\u2019s first poet laureate, a speaker explains that each People has been given their own language to reach with. I understand reaching as active, a motion. He offers a prayer and introduction in heritage language. I listen as I reach my eyes into my hands, my hands onto my lap, my lap as the quiet page I hold my daughter in. I rock her back, forward, to the rise of other conversations.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the poet Layli Long Soldier. The question I\u2019m always kind of pursuing, and the way each individual life is its own way in to this question is, \u201CWhat does it mean to be human?\u201D And I also know every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life. But there\u2019s some things you\u2019ve said about writing that I just find so intriguing. I feel like the way you\u2019ve written about them is how writing forms you as a human being. Like you wrote somewhere, \u201CIt\u2019s an endeavor I grew into and now provides a solid deep joy. Perhaps this joy from writing is seated comfortably in my core because of the life lesson it\u2019s provided. Writing has shown me what happens with patience.\u201D And some place else, you wrote, \u201CThe surprises I\u2019ve experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love.\u201D I wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and \u2014 as a way into the question of what you\u2019re learning about what it means to be human through the life you lead. I think the writing practice was something that I had not expected to be a good fit. I had never thought, \u201COh, I want to be a writer one day. But I went to the Institute of American Indian Arts, and they didn\u2019t have a music program. That\u2019s what I wanted to study. But I really wanted to go to school there. So I felt like the next best thing was to study writing. It was not easy. A lot of \u2014 I would say the first three, three and a half years, I wrote some really, really, really bad, bad, bad poems, like really dry. It took me a long time. But I think it was that patience that is something I\u2019ve learned through writing, a sense of patience and the reward that comes from that. Even I\u2019m just now thinking about the piece \u201C38.\u201D But that piece, for example, took me \u2014 I want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write. But it was important to me. It\u2019s an epic piece. It\u2019s like six pages long. Would you just briefly say what\u2019s happening in that piece? In \u201C38?\u201D Yeah. Just briefly, in \u201C38,\u201D it\u2019s written to and for the Dakota 38, who were 38 Dakota men who were hung under the orders of President Abraham Lincoln as a result of the Sioux uprising, which came at a time when Dakota people, their territory, their land, was getting smaller and smaller, and finally down to something like a 10-mile tract. And the people, Dakota people did not have hunting rights beyond that. And basically, they had no store credit with the traders, and so they were basically starving. So there was an uprising, and as a result, these 38 men were hung, and then Dakota people were moved west to South Dakota area in different \u2014 basically, they lost their land in the Minnesota region. This was the largest legal mass execution in U.S. history and\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s right. And it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed The Emancipation Proclamation. Yes, that\u2019s right. This history we don\u2019t know. That\u2019s right. Or we don\u2019t teach. So you were just talking about \u2014 this took a long \u2014 this emerged your patience, writing all of this. Yeah, absolutely. I just think that I\u2019ve learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with a piece and patient with yourself. I think, at least, for me, the imagination is something that I really have to respect like its own little person in me. And so I can\u2019t demand too much of it. Sometimes I have to let it take a rest and then come back and be in conversation with it again. But it\u2019s a beautiful process that I\u2019ve learned through writing. Yeah. I was looking at page 64, \u201CWHEREAS I did not desire in childhood,\u201D and also page 65, which was another \u2014 part of the way you also reflected on what an apology is is about your experience of a really big apology that came from your father. And I think that we don\u2019t often enough value the intelligence we have about something like an apology, even if we\u2019re thinking about that as public work. The intelligence that we have from our personal experiences, we don\u2019t understand that that translates too. So, anyway\u2026 Well, yeah. I actually would \u2014 I might mention that the piece about my father, the apology he gave me, I really do actually consider that almost the heart of this whole response. And I think \u2014 the reason is I think it was the most effective and the most miraculous apology that I\u2019d ever received in my life. I think \u2014 now, I should clarify before I say anything that my dad and I have a pretty good relationship now. We keep in touch and visit and text and call each other. But when I was younger, he wasn\u2019t around a lot, and he had a lot going on in his life. So that created a great emptiness and all kinds of stuff. So I had a lot of stuff I was carrying around with me. And when I was in my 20s, he came to visit one time and unexpectedly, he was sitting at breakfast with me and apologized for not being there. And I think there was something in the way he said it. He cried when he said it. And I could feel it, I could physically feel that he meant it. And really \u2014 and I can say this to this day \u2014 in that moment, all of it was gone. Like, all that stuff I\u2019d been carrying around \u2014 it was gone. It was lifted. And I feel, in many ways, we started new from that point on. I really have not had the need to go back and rehash things with him and so on. We started from that place forward. We\u2019ve known each other in a different way. You want to read that? OK. \u201CWHEREAS I heard a noise I thought was a sneeze. At the breakfast table pushing eggs around my plate I wondered if he liked my cooking, thought about what to talk about. He pinched his fingers to the bridge of his nose, squeezed his eyes. He wiped. I often say he was a terrible drinker when I was a child I\u2019m not afraid to say it because he\u2019s different now: sober, attentive, showered, eating. But in my childhood when things were different I rolled onto my side, my hands together as if to pray, locked between my knees. When things were different I lay there for long hours, my face to the wall, blank. My eyes left me, my soldiers, my two scouts to the unseen. And because language is the immaterial I never could speak about the missing so perhaps I cried for the invisible, what I could not see, doubly. What is it to wish for the absence of nothing? There at the breakfast table as an adult, wondering what to talk about if he liked my cooking, pushing the invisible to the plate\u2019s edge I looked up to see he hadn\u2019t sneezed, he was crying. I\u2019d never heard him cry, didn\u2019t recognize the symptoms. I turned to him when I heard him say I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there sorry for many things / like that / curative voicing / an opened bundle / or medicine / or birthday wishing / my hand to his shoulder / it\u2019s okay I said it\u2019s over now I meant it / because of our faces blankly / because of a lifelong stare down / because of centuries in sorry;\u201D Layli Long Soldier is a professor of English at Din\u00E9 College, a community college of the Navajo people, in the Four Corners region of Arizona.
