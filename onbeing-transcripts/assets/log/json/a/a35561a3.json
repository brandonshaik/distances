  "fullText": "The first thing I understand is mystery. And, I moved to the great desert of the Middle East. And I realized that the God of Abraham, who is the God of the Jew, the Christian, and the Muslim, revealed himself in the desert. God intrudes in a moment. He revealed himself that day, that moment. Well, he also reveals himself in that place. Well, what is that place? It is sand. After September 11, Richard Rodriguez traveled to the Middle East to explore his kinship, as a Roman Catholic, with the men who stepped onto airplanes and turned them into weapons of terror. What he learned illuminates some of the deepest paradox and promise of the world we inhabit. He is an especially intriguing conversation partner for right now \u2014 a life and mind straddling left and right, religious and secular, immigrant and intellectual. In this second episode in our \u201CAmerican Consciousness\u201D series, we mine his wisdom on the emerging fabric of human identity. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Richard Rodriguez is an acclaimed writer, best known to many for his years of original commentary on the PBS \u201CNewsHour.\u201D He was born in Sacramento, California, the first-generation child of Mexican immigrant parents. His lyrical writing embodies the way particular human experience, articulately recorded, can reveal deep truths about what is enduringly human and universally animating. His books include: Hunger Of Memory; Brown: The Last Discovery Of America; and in 2013, Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography. We spoke in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York. So, I start every one of my conversations, um, whether I\u2019m with a quantum physicist or a journalist, uh, with this question, which is a question you\u2019ve explored in great depths in your writing. Would you tell us about the religious and spiritual background of your childhood? Uh, it was total. I grew up, uh, Roman Catholic. Though that doesn\u2019t even do it justice. I grew up in Sacramento, California, in a neighborhood, uh \u2014 I hate to use the term white, \u2018cause white doesn\u2019t tell me anything. White doesn\u2019t tell me enough. White doesn\u2019t tell me that your father was a coal miner. Uh, white doesn\u2019t tell me that your son died in a canoe accident. Um \u2014 but it was white. Um, and I went to a Catholic school where everyone was Catholic, with one exception, Bobby Wright, who was Episcopalian. Uh, and he would bow his head when we prayed. And I was surrounded by Irish voices. Those were my first English voices. And that\u2019s how I learned the English language, through Ireland, oddly enough. Um, all the priests, all the nuns, were Irish. This is Mercy were the nuns. And I dedicate Darling to them, um, because they were truly the first feminists of my life. But the remarkable thing was that from an early age, I was also an altar boy. That is, I was on the altar responding in Latin to the priest. Uh, and to this day I remember at a graveside helping to carry a coffin to the open pit. And then going back to arithmetic class in an hour. You know. The seamlessness of that life. But I remember also, this is the power of memory, the power of poetry to instill itself on a child\u2019s imagination. Um, those are the first lines I say in response to the priest. I will go to the altar of God, the God who gives joy to my youth. So people ask me now, you know, what was the church to you, um, it was completely embracing. And total. And it began, at an early age, and just grew in mystery and majesty. We had, uh, Mozart masses. And there was this sense that I belonged to this European civilization. At the same time that I would go back and read Mark Twain, who refers to Romans and Papists as, you know, aliens in some sense, um, or Henry James, who goes to Europe to meet a society that was already mine in Sacramento. So it was like living two seasons, summer and winter. There was the Church, the Catholic Church and then there was America. The America of Mark Twain and Henry James. You know, there\u2019s this, um, line in your memoir, Hunger of Memory, that I thought was so striking. You said, of all the institutions in their lives, only the Catholic Church had seemed aware of the fact that my mother and father are thinkers, persons aware of their experience of their lives. Yes. This is \u2014 I think this is the power of liturgy and ritual, the seasons of grief and triumph, the seasons of renewal and sorrow. Um, the power of religion to make us reflective of the lives we are leading seems to me to encourage an inwardness, which I would call intellectual. And when I think of what the peasant Church, all over the world, is still able to give people is that same consolation of the inner life, no small gift. No. I must tell you, Krista, I lived most of my life now among people who are not religious, people who are anti-religious. My brother considers himself not an atheist, but an anti-theist, uh, he says that the word atheism doesn\u2019t grasp the fullness of his negativity toward religion. Um, and so when I write about religion as I do, I\u2019m always worried about what the secular reader is going to make of this line. The worry I have is always that, um, you know, that my writing will be too pious, uh, for the\u2026 For the secular. For the stylish, I\u2019ll call them. OK. Or too stylish for the pious. I just want you to know everybody here is stylish, too, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s summer and they\u2019ve let their guard down. You know what I mean. There\u2019s just a \u2014 \u00A0that the uses of irony and paradox are not always apparent in religious, uh, writing. Well, we\u2019ll probably come back to that. I want to talk about your \u2014 I want to kind of \u2014 \u00A0again the beginning \u2014 the trajectory of your life and what you\u2019ve learned. And sort of what this theme of the American consciousness, you know, here\u2019s another observation you made, that Americans like to talk about the importance of family values, but America isn\u2019t a country of family values. Mexico is a country of family values. This is a country of people who leave home. Yeah. And you \u2014 in your childhood, um, had to leave home linguistically and intellectually, in order to unite your private and public selves. Yeah, when I announce that I\u2019m going to college, uh, Stanford, uh, immediately my mother is worried, you\u2019re not, you know, in a way that maybe, you know, Appalachia would understand this, the betrayal of education. That I\u2019m going away from the family. That I\u2019m going to get ideas that are too big for me. That, uh, that I\u2019m going to begin to reject my own culture. And in fact, it happens. Uh, education is a subversive influence in our lives. We don\u2019t realize this, especially because so much of education is dedicated to class mobility. We don\u2019t realize at how much a price that working class families pay psychologically to have their children leave home. Yeah, the whole family. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hm. And something so striking to me, again, in the trajectory of your life, is that you grew up, as you described a minute ago, being so aware of being brown in a white world. And needing to join that white world, um, to become your fullest self. One of the themes that you\u2019ve been writing about and talking about here in the 21st century is that the color of your skin, brown, in all its variety, is the new color of American identity. You even say Barack Obama is not the first black president, he\u2019s the first brown president. Yes. Well, I think that, you know, if you \u2014 I think that would have been stunning if we had understood what his brownness from the beginning. That there is in this man, you know, both Kansas and Kenya, that he is \u2014 he\u2019s mixed. That whole idea of being mixed is very difficult for Americans. We have, on the one hand, this notion of the one-drop theory. That if you have one drop of African blood, you\u2019re black and so very, very light skinned people will tell you, well, I\u2019m black. And I keep thinking, well, maybe I\u2019m not getting enough sleep, you know. Uh, or people say, you know, I\u2019m white, and many times they have such different colors. A lot of white people are pink, and orange. And, um, and at the end of summer, a lot of them are brown, but\u2026 \u2026they don\u2019t say that. They say that they\u2019re tanned. Uh, but that inability to deal with mixture, I think, is part of the American anxiety about individuality and I think we don\u2019t realize the complexity of people that have created us, complexity of civilizations. I was created by Spain, and by native societies in the Americas. I carry on my face the Indian nose, the Indian mouth, all my religion came from Spain. My first language, Spanish, came from Spain. But there is obviously something in me of the Indian that I have to account for. For me to say that I am one thing in a place where I am many things. Um, every point I have is to realize the complexity of my life. And it is not exactly true that I grew up in a white society. My Mexican Aunt, uh, Lola, married my uncle from India, Krishna, at a time in California where, um, the restrictions on immigration were such that Indian men could not bring women into the country. So there was a lot of Mexican-Indian marriage \u2014 intermarriage. So, that I was quite accustomed, as a child, to turbans, and Hindus. Uh, my uncle\u2019s sister, uh, Ruth Gupta, who became a big landowner in San Francisco, when she died, Dianne Feinstein was at her funeral. But I can remember her lifting her hands over the turkey at Christmas and chanting the Hindu hymn. And the turkey did not flinch. So, but this is so interesting to think about, because it\u2019s always been true, and it\u2019s certainly always been true in America that we came from many peoples and many places. This complexity was \u2014 there\u2019s some Cherokee in me, which doesn\u2019t show. Um, uh, I mean I think what\u2019s happening now is that physiologically, the mixing has started to show on us. Yes, and I think also\u2026 And so there\u2019s a shift in consciousness, I think you\u2019re saying, you know, this is changing us from the inside out on another level as well. I think something else is going on, too. I think that we are living in a society \u2014 my optimism about this moment is that people are falling in love all over the place. Uh, this is one of the great civilizations of love. It drives the churches crazy, of course. Uh, because they don\u2019t want to lose their members, and the purity of line. And because they\u2019re \u2014 they also \u2014 the church \u2014 my own church would not give me the word love to describe my relationship to another man, with whom I\u2019ve lived for 35 years, but that\u2019s another point. Um, there is now, not, you know, I remember the nuns saying, uh, to us the dangers of mixed marriages, by which they did not mean racially mixed, but the danger of marrying a Methodist, you know. Yeah. So now I get a letter from a young woman, um, uh, on starched, white stationery yet, uh, no email, uh, she sends. And she says in the first sentence of her letter, she says that, uh, my mother is a New York Jew, and my father is an Iranian Muslim. And I think to myself, well, that\u2019s very brown, uh, to be a Jewish Muslim. And then she says in the second line of her letter \u2014 this is a true story. She says most Americans think that I\u2019m a very frugal terrorist. Yeah. I\u2019m telling you \u2014 I\u2019m telling you there are things going on religiously in America that our religious institutions are bewildered by, people who belong to more \u2014 more than one faith or Catholics who call themselves Zen Sufis. I mean, uh, it\u2019s within the complexity of that, is the brownness that may envelop us. Now I warn you also that there are purifying movements in the world. Look at what\u2019s going on in Iraq right now, where the nation divides over separations \u2014 ancient separations that we thought we had gotten over. Yeah. Where even in single families, where there was mixture, there suddenly is separation. And in many movements now, this desire for purity, uh, the skinhead movement in America. I\u2019m going to go up to Idaho and I\u2019m going meet only white people like myself. You can keep L.A. You can keep the DMV in L.A. with all those languages. I\u2019m going to live in a pure section with pure water, with pure air. I\u2019m going to live in this little corner. Well, that dream of purity is very much alive at exactly the moment when everything is mixing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in a live conversation with journalist and essayist Richard Rodriguez. We\u2019re in the outdoor hall of philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in New York in a week devoted to exploring the American Consciousness. And you took yourself on a really fascinating journey. After September 11, 2001, which was a moment in this culture where we absolutely saw this dangerous \u201COther.\u201D I mean, Islam \u2014 this religion of over one billion people \u2014 had been there all along. But we saw this terrifying face of the \u201COther.\u201D And you made this, I would say, in that context, countercultural move of exploring your kinship with these men who were terrorists. I mean, you wrote \u2014 you realized, \u201CI worship the same God as they, in this, as a monotheist. So I stand in some relation to those men.\u201D And you set out to understand what had happened in that sense. Well, the first thing I understand is mystery. And that is, I moved to the desert, to the great desert of the Middle East. And I realized that the God of Abraham, who is the God of the Jew, the Christian, and the Muslim, revealed himself in the desert. You know, the distinction that these religions claim temporally, is God intrudes in a moment of time, of the eternal God becomes temporal. He revealed himself that day, that moment. Well, he also reveals himself in time \u2014 in place. He reveals himself in that place. Oh what is that place? What is that place that the Israelis and the Palestinians are fighting over? It\u2019s sand. It is desolate sand. It is in some places, there are deserts in Saudi Arabia that are as lunar as anything I expect to encounter in my life. This is a holy landscape. It is also a landscape that drives us crazy. Somehow the \u2014 in this landscape, we got the idea that there is a God who is as lonely for us as we are for Him. And there is in this landscape, also, a necessity for tribe. Not for \u2014 you do not live as an individual on the desert. You live in tribes. And that tribal allegiance, that tribal impulse, leads on the one hand, to great consolation, but also to the kind of havoc we are seeing now. I have a chapter on Jerusalem as the great desert city, but also, this \u2014 our own American desert city, which is Las Vegas. Right. That\u2019s what we do with desert. Yes. Well, when I say\u2026 That\u2019s what we do with desert. When I said the deserts drive us mad, I mean Las Vegas. That there is something about the desert that terrifies us. So Las Vegas gets this idea of playing with that idea of death. It most \u2014 since everything is an impermanent, that I\u2019m just going to move \u2014 Eiffel Tower, don\u2019t you \u2014 to across the street from the pyramids. Um, and that nothing, you know, I\u2019m going to roll out a carpet of golf green over there, and Olympic-sized swimming pools. It totally defies finitude and frailty, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s right. But the interesting thing, though, is that it spread \u2014 that Las Vegas-ization is spreading out to the Middle East. I speak of the city like Dubai, for example. You go to the hotel and the woman says, we\u2019re going to upgrade you to a suite on the 185th floor, and you open the windows and there is a desolation out there. But don\u2019t worry about that. You can go downstairs to the ice palace and you can have a snow, uh, snowball fight in the ice ballroom. Now, Mecca is becoming Las Vegas. There is over the Kaaba within sight of the Kaaba, a vast hotel built in the shape of Big Ben. Where did they get that idea, except for Las Vegas? This enormous hotel, I think it\u2019s run by the Fairmont Hotel chain. At the bottom of the hotel chain, there is a super mall. So there is in the middle of the holiest space in Islam this invasion of place of what the desert is. This is where we were meant to encounter God. You understand what I\u2019m saying to you? Not the glade. Every Christmas, I\u2019d get these Christmas cards that make it appear that Jesus was born in the Swiss Alps. And the evergreen tree has all these little sparkles to it, you know. It\u2019s so funny. It\u2019s desert. The three great ecologies of these religions are mountaintop. And finally, finally, and most profoundly, the cave. You have to acknowledge when you wander the desert, how bright and blinding is light. And how consoling is twilight and darkness. In these religions, oftentimes shade and darkness come as consolations, or gifts, so that Mohammed has his revelation in a cave, in the darkness. In Judaism, God puts Moses in the mouth of a cave so that he will not be blinded by the brightness of God. And in Christianity, the two most holy events of the \u2014 of Christ\u2019s life, the birth of Christ, which happens in a cave, and the death of God \u2014 the death of Christ. And also the resurrection happened in a cave. We sometimes forget it because we are consumed by a kind of a Hellenistic dream of coming out of the cave with Plato, and into the sunlight, that we are people of dark. Do you\u2026 And we should accept that darkness as part of our faith. Well, I guess that leads into what I want to ask you. I mean how did you come to realize how the desert in this tradition and the cave, how these things had formed you, um, the Catholic spirituality that you find to be redemptive. Well, the deepest, I mean, the most radical Catholic spirituality I know of, is Spanish. And it\u2019s a mystical tradition of the dark night of the soul. Yeah. Um, we often, you know, I end this book with Mother Teresa, who was, um, hounded by Christopher Hitchens, our great American atheist going from cable channel to cable channel to tell us God was dead. Um, at a time in which \u2014 I live part of the year in London. And I assure you, God is not dead in London. Muslims are plentiful, as are Hindus. Uh, but nonetheless, Mother Teresa, after her death, these letters, uh, to confessors and bishops were revealed. For 40 years of her life, Mother Teresa describes her life as a darkness. And there she is, more and more famous in the world, uh, mocked by Christopher Hitchens in the pages of Vanity Fair magazine. I mean, In Vanity Fair magazine, Christopher Hitchens tells us that Mother Teresa is ugly. Right. And I think to myself, what is that? What is he playing on in America that you can say about a pious old woman who is bathing the dying in Calcutta. What is that? And in the end of your book, you do, you have this huge journey and you \u2014 and I wanted to ask you why you ended there, because you do end with the juxtaposition of Christopher Hitchens, with his exuberant certainty that there is no God\u2026 Yes. \u2026and, um, to the very end of his life, and Mother Teresa, in her despair. I once was with her in San Quentin prison. We weren\u2019t prisoners, but we were visiting. And she \u2014 it was the most remarkable afternoon I\u2019ve \u2014 I can remember, religiously. Uh, she was \u2014 there was a group of thugs and she was supposed to meet these guys from death row and they were all like schoolboys. And this tiny little woman, you know, four foot tall or something in her sari. And then listen to this. She tells them in that little tiny voice, she tells them, if you want to see the face of God, look at the prisoner standing next to you. These tattoos coming up over their necks, look at the man next to you. This man who has murdered and raped. That\u2019s the face of God and I think, oh, I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019d been looking at the holy picture all this time when I should look more closely at the face of the sinner to find the face of God. You can listen again and share this conversation with Richard Rodriguez through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in the second episode of our \u201CAmerican Consciousness\u201D series, we\u2019re with Richard Rodriguez. He is one of America\u2019s great observers of self and society. His life and mind straddle discourses of left and right, of immigrant and intellectual, of secular and religious. We spoke at the Chautauqua Institution\u2019s 2014 season, before an audience in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy. I do want to talk about immigration, which is also a very painful and open subject in\u2026 It\u2019s an opportunity. Yeah. Uh, for Christians, um, Christians, I\u2019m telling you, um, it is noticeable, the silence of American Christians on this issue. Uh, it is quite clear to me, what the gospels tell us to do with the stranger in our midst. But there is something in this obliviousness that is very worrying, particularly in a time when the American churches, Christianity particularly, would be in decline numerically were it not for immigrant populations coming into this country. The Mormon church, now, which is the fastest-growing, uh, church in the country, is in its majority now, primarily Spanish-speaking. The Southern Baptist now are becoming increasingly Hispanic in their membership. At a timing which there \u2014 these churches are seeing the growth of these populations, within their own pews, you would think that some of the leadership would speak for this, for example, the children at the border. Where are the Christians in all of this? And you know, I think there are Christians and religious people in those places where some of this drama is playing out with the children, for example. I do too. And they don\u2019t get covered in such a high profile way by my fellow journalists, which is something I\u2019m always aware of. Yes. I mean, you have, though, some really particular insights into this border, this Mexican-American border, which so defines us, but I think we tend to be oblivious to it a lot of the time, until something blows up like this. Um, I mean, you\u2019ve talked about the psychic tension between Mexican stoicism and American optimism. Can you talk about that dynamic? Well, I mean, the \u2014 can I say something about drugs, uh, in this culture? Um, what Mexicans will ask me all the time, Mexican relatives of mine, why are the Americans so unhappy? I don\u2019t know what to tell them. Why are we taking it up our nose and putting it in our veins, and \u2014 when we can\u2019t be alone without drugs, we can\u2019t be with other people without drugs. We can\u2019t have sex without drugs. We can\u2019t go to sleep without drugs. We can\u2019t wake up without drugs. We can\u2019t get out of bed without drugs. What is this addiction? We have destabilized much of the world with our addiction. We\u2019ve \u2014 we have created a drug economy in Afghanistan, in Thailand, in Bolivia and we\u2019ve caused turmoil in Guatemala and now we have elevated thugs in Mexico to the status of billionaires with our despair. And yet, we are an optimistic people. And yet, Mexico, by comparison, is a tragic civilization in which death is very much a part of the \u2014 of one\u2019s understanding of what life is. The paradox of the border right now, is that you see young people coming to the American border for the opportunity of America, at exactly the time when Americans are importing drugs from Latin America because of the despair of our unhappiness. Yeah. And it \u2014 the paradox of that movement in both directions is so interesting to me and so little noted, but it is \u00A0\u2014 why don\u2019t we talk about difficult things? The book I read as an American kid and the nuns told me it was the great classic of American literature, was the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This romance in America of being on the move of leaving home. Well, there they are. They\u2019re seven and eight years old and they\u2019re at their border and we\u2019re horrified by them now because we don\u2019t even recognize our own myth. You know, you just \u2014 you\u2019ve named a couple of really important things in the last few minutes and I think you\u2019ve also named the important fact that we don\u2019t have a vocabulary for talking about what\u2019s really at stake here. We can sometimes define these things in terms of policy, laws that we might take. And, you know, so I want to come back to something you \u2014 wrote about or spoke about when you were actually commenting on how we, in the last 20, 30 years, well, actually before that, consigned religion to the sidelines. And then what happened in the last 20, 30 years is we had a few strident voices who emerged. We kind of gave it over to them, which made almost everybody else get really quiet. Um, but you made an observation that is relevant to this beyond that specter, you said \u2014 what you ask, you know, \u201CWhat\u2019s happened to us \u2014 and I would include myself on the cultural left,\u201D you say, \u201Cis that we have almost no language to talk about the dream life of America, to talk about the soul of America, to talk about this mystery of being alive at this point in our lives, this point in our national history.\u201D Yeah, I \u2014 can I say because it\u2019s the churches. Can I say that one of things that concerns me about religion right now is how little we understand who we are. For example, I \u2014 since I\u2019m in England, there\u2019s a neighborhood Anglican church and they try to be very hip and try to bring in young people. And they put the book of common prayer on a Kindle machine. And I think to myself, do they not understand that these religions \u2014 the Abrahamic religions were religions of the Word. Are religions of the Word and that they \u2014 \u00A0that their power is in the weight of the Word. The Word became flesh. You understand? And it is something carried in the Bar Mitzvah, in by the child, the weight in its hands, it is kissed, it is revered as weight. That is \u2014 it enters history and we seem as Christians, well, we sort of understand that, but we sort of don\u2019t. I tell Jewish audiences, if I ever go into a Bar Mitzvah and the kid comes in with a kindle, I\u2019m getting out of there. You \u2014 you\u2019ve also said, and we don\u2019t have time to get into this now, but that the \u2014 what the desert of California has done by innovating cyberspace and pushing on to cyberspace is just an extension of this American preoccupation with pushing back the horizon, pushing back the boundaries. Yes, and ignoring where we are. We\u2019re in the middle of an intersection, the bus is coming right towards you, but I have to chase \u2014 check my Facebook account, you know. This obliviousness \u2014 it \u2014 we have it backwards. Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, we invented Henry Ford. We were anxious. We needed to get away from the house. We wanted to get away from our in-laws. We wanted cheap transportation. So we invented Henry Ford who gave us Model T Ford. We did not \u2014 we invent \u2014 we were stuck in the suburbs. We were lonely. We didn\u2019t want to deal with the mall anymore. So we invented Steve Jobs. He gave us this technology which would allow us to go \u2014 to talk to anyone in the world without leaving our room. Would allow us to shop anywhere in the world. We don\u2019t have to deal with crowds anymore. We can just push buttons. You have to acknowledge with what there is about human anxiety that has created this technology. Mm. What is it that it is trying to meet? What is that? Is I guess is what I\u2019m asking. And I think that\u2019s another large question that we need to be sitting in the middle of our common life and we need vocabulary to grapple with. So I\u2019m going to ask one more question, and please come up if you have a question, if you\u2019d like to join the conversation. Um, you know, you\u2019ve been controversial over the years for, uh, saying that bilingualism is not desirable. You, um, \u2014 that the language of the minority, which was how you understood yourself, is inadequate. That, you know, that affirmative action is problematic. You know, it seems to me that our entire way of grappling with difference, which we really only started to grapple with in this country in the 1960s. You know, we enshrined the civic virtue of tolerance, and it\u2019s not nearly big enough. And I wonder if, you know, you\u2019ve been talking about these kinds of things for decades. Uh, you know, I wonder if many of the things we invented in these early decades were all half-steps. And if you see \u2014 how you see \u2014 do you see us evolving into something richer and more adequate? Uh, I have to say yes, because I believe \u2014 I have faith. Uh, but I also think that there \u2014 the word diversity comes from the word divide. So when you\u2019re talking about celebrating diversity, are we celebrating the fact that I am not you? What am I celebrating? It seems to me that the Christian impulse is not diverse, but it\u2019s to seek a commonality. Right, but, I mean, that move you made after 9/11 when you talked about you \u2014 you abhorred that act of terrorism, but you had to understand your kinship with those men. Yes, and I \u2014 I\u2019m so \u2014 here I am in Cairo, in this foreign city, and I keep hearing the Arabic around me, which I can understand a bit, but not so well. Um, and it sounds Spanish to me. And I think \u2014 I said to myself, I say it to a friend of mine, I said, why is there so much Spanish in Arabic? And they said, that isn\u2019t Spanish and Arabic, that\u2019s \u2014 what you don\u2019t understand is that there are three to 4,000 Arabic words in Spanish, because Spain was once a Muslim country. And then he says, and will be again. But then I remember my mother, my Mexican mother, standing at the door on a rainy day, \u201COjal\u00E1,\u201D she says. Ojal\u00E1 which means in Spanish, \u201Clet\u2019s hope.\u201D \u201COjal\u00E1 all the clouds are coming, it won\u2019t rain this afternoon.\u201D \u201COjal\u00E1 the sale at Penny\u2019s will be on this weekend and I can get you a new jacket.\u201D Ojal\u00E1, and I did not hear for the thousands of times that I heard that expression, I did not hear the name of Allah on her lips. O-ja-l\u00E1, it came from the 16th century. And there are things we talked about the genetic blood that we carry of ancestors and tribes, people are paying $450.00 to get their DNA checked, and they\u2019re finding out that they belong to civilizations their grandparents told them nothing about. Well, linguistically, too, we belong to civilizations far away, and what I began to realize, of course, is that the Muslim is within me and it certainly was on my mother\u2019s lips. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in a live conversation with journalist and essayist Richard Rodriguez. We\u2019re in the outdoor hall of philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in New York in a week devoted to exploring the American Consciousness. OK. Let\u2019s invite you in. Yes. Hi. Uh, I am particularly interested in looking at the intersection of religion and faith, and homosexuality. So I would love to hear you reflect just a bit about what that\u2019s meant in your life, given the religion you were born into and who God made you to be. Um, when I speak before Catholic audiences invariably now, a man will come up to me afterwards and will say, my son is gay. A word that I don\u2019t use, by the way, um, because I\u2019m morose. Um, but, uh\u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d get that. Charlie Rose once asked whether I\u2019m a gay writer and I said, no, I\u2019m a morose writer. This expression being gay is so \u2014 it\u2019s like a little sparkler at the Fourth of July or something. Anyway, um, you know, one of the things I don\u2019t think we really, as a Catholic, I was surrounded by an iconography, which was luscious and physical, and there was the bleeding Christ on every cross that I ever saw. And the eroticism of the religion was, to my imagination, very, very rich from an early age. At some level, this church which denied me also gave me a great deal. I want to be clear about that. Um, I do not want to present myself in any way as oppressed. It did teach me, and this is the point of Darling. I\u2019m \u2014 Darling in the book is not Richard Rodriguez. Darling in the book is a woman, a friend of mine, who has lunch with me in Malibu, California, on the day her divorce was finalized. She has since died of cancer. The chapter really is about women and religion. And I think that I came upon that theme, that subject, because I am gay. Uh, I don\u2019t want to talk about myself. But all I want to say to the Christian churches, is that the man that I\u2019m with, I will say not even \u2014 I won\u2019t even give myself the grandeur of this word. But his achievement and his importance to me is that he has loved me. And he has taught me the import of that word. The church will not give us that word. I date my emancipation as a homosexual man with the women\u2019s movement. And I notice that Susan B. Anthony came to this place to argue for the vote for women. When women begin to call for the vote, it is a revolutionary act, and it liberates me. And I\u2019ll tell you how. For the first time, women are saying I don\u2019t want to be identified merely with what I am at the house. In civic society, I don\u2019t have to be somebody\u2019s mother, or wife, or grandmother. I want to be judged equally with any man in the voting booth. And when women get the vote, they move out of the kitchen in something like the way that they allowed me several decades later, to move out of the closet. These movements are related to each other. I cannot imagine my freedom without women. Thank you for that. Uh, I, uh, self-identify as a cultural Jewish faithful Unitarian Universalist. But, nonetheless, or possibly because of, uh, I want to go back to the comments that you made, uh, addressed to this largely Christian community about the lack of leadership of presence at the border, uh, involving the deportation of children and the larger immigration questions, which we Americans are not doing well with, to say the very least. And I wonder if you would comment on, uh, a theory that keeps on boiling in my own head about the paralysis of the former Protestant mainline leadership. And whether it is consciously or probably unconsciously due to the fear of the impending death of white hegemony. That\u2019s \u2014 that, pretty interesting questions. Uh, I do think that we have allowed \u2014 there\u2019s a religion in this country, and it\u2019s quite powerful, if you are an immigrant child, because you know that it exists. And I\u2019ll call it Americanism. And it has great charm. It has great bravery. It has great grandeur. And it gave me great freedom. But it is not exactly my Christian faith or my Jewish faith. Uh, I am taught in my religion, things that are not exactly the things that America teaches me. I am taught in my religion that, um, that I will fail, that I\u2019m a sinful creature. I heard it this morning. I am taught in my religion that, uh, that I can\u2019t make this alone. That I need you. I\u2019m taught in America that my strength is as an individual. That I have to leave home. I\u2019m taught in this country contrary things, is what I want to say. And in some way, I think as we became \u2014 certainly I\u2019ll say this about Catholics. As we became more and more mainline, we became afraid to say that we were in some way alien to the culture. In some way quizzical about it. That\u2019s what worries me. That we have sort of turned our Christianity, our Jewishness, into something, what shall we say? Uh, polite and nice. OK? I mean, uh, there\u2019s only one solution to the problem of immigration. That is that, uh, you should have a law, a new amendment to the Constitution that says that you have to leave this country after three generations. Because quite clearly the vitality of the country comes with immigrants and their children and it begins to wane. I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m nowhere near as interesting as my mother. I swear to you. And, I mean, she ended up typing in Governor Brown\u2019s \u2014 Edmund G. Pat Brown\u2019s office, uh, for a while, until she was fired because she mistyped \u2014 she heard on the \u2014 on the Dictaphone a reference to urban guerillas and she thought it was the animal. So she typed in urban gorillas, and so she was reassigned a job. But, um, I said to keep this country the country that \u2014 of the 19th century, this country that \u2014 \u00A0of this village, if you want to keep that country, you should send everybody who\u2019s been here for more than three generations to Australia or Costa Rica or someplace. But this country has \u2014 I saw a picture, I think it was in The New York Times, of this little boy swimming with his sister. He must have been about 10. She was about 7. And I thought of their bravery, their extraordinary bravery in making that recklessness, their flirtation with danger. And I thought, God, a country that beckons these people, that\u2019s the country I\u2019d like to live in. Thank you. OK. Two brief comments. Uh, Dr. Unger talked about the fact \u2014 and you\u2019ve alluded to it indirectly, that we have no prophets anymore. That we\u2019ve lost our prophets. There\u2019s nobody of any substance who speaks as the prophets used to speak. And I\u2019d like to hear you address that. Also, I\u2019m from Austin, Texas, and I doubt many people here know that the Dallas County judge has opened the city of Dallas to 2,000 children. I did\u2026 Uh, he\u2019s supported by the churches and the schools. Good for him. And we\u2019re \u2014 yeah. We\u2019re trying to do something similar in Austin, and I\u2019ve talked \u2014 I\u2019m a physician, a retired physician. And I\u2019ve talked with some colleagues and \u2014 and we\u2019re committed to \u2014 if the kids get to Austin, we\u2019ll take care of them. So there are things happening. But let me say \u2014 just in response to the question about prophets. I think this country has plenty of prophets, but most of them are false prophets. Uh, the seriousness with which people give now to our political commentators, at a point when our political life is in shambles, uh, you get the leaders you deserve. I say this to Catholic audiences, you get the priests you deserve. We get the prophets we deserve. Look around you. Look around this country at the people who can change the country. There are, you know, I\u2019m often puzzled why we have decided you pay for television. You pay for who\u2019s on and who\u2019s off. Why have we decided that tonight we\u2019re going to hear a conversation from two dull people. Uh, and that will constitute\u2026 So, this crowd has obviously chosen an alternative. Um, I\u2019d really like to get both of you in, but we need to be quick, because we have to clear this space out. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m \u2014 my answers are too long, so, my apologies. They\u2019re very \u2014 no, they\u2019re great. It\u2019s just \u2014 we have these limits. Yes. Uh, my question is I \u2014 you guys mentioned briefly before interfaith relationships kind of hinted at that. And I\u2019m curious the differences that you might see between an interfaith relationship where, say, one person is a Muslim, and another is a Christian. And a relationship in which one person has a faith, say Christianity, and the other one is an agnostic or an atheist. Um, yeah, do you have any insights on the differences? Yeah, I do. I think it\u2019s both good and bad. The good is that I believe in brown \u2014 I believe that God has a brown face I believe that is \u2014 within the complexity, uh, that God is probably in a yoga position right now. Um, but I also believe that, um, there is a difference between brown and beige. The hard ones are \u2014 if I say can you tell me the difference between a Methodist and Presbyterian? If \u2014 can you tell me the difference between Catholic and a Protestant? Uh, one has bigger churches? Uh, uh. The \u2014 and then you say, well this \u2014 they believe this, and they believe that. Well, that\u2019s cool, they\u2019ll say. And everything becomes beige. Nothing matters. You understand? I told this to a group of young, uh, girl students at a high school the other day, Do not be beige. There are some things that are non-negotiable. The mistreatment of women, for example, is non-negotiable. That\u2019s not beige. You understand? That\u2019s black and white and in some way, we have to be clear about what it is we believe. That the centrality is of love, of our experience as Christians. We either believe it or we don\u2019t. Love, I\u2019m not talking about marriage, the centrality of love and, um, that\u2019s not negotiable. And when I come upon somebody whose values move in a different direction, I learn from them in many cases, that they\u2019re not mine. And I\u2019m prepared to say that. You\u2026 That\u2019s not my tradition. I really think that the new generation coming up is going to learn and teach us to live with robust identities, and even convictions, understanding that the world needs their robust identities, but also, at the same time, that you want to live peaceably and creatively with different others. Yeah. And\u2026 That second \u2014 that \u2014 the capacity of the young to live with \u2014 with people who are unlike themselves, is quite stunning. Yes. And you see that now. And they have a whole new set of instincts. Yeah. Just want to, um, actually I thought maybe, uh, it would be fitting, especially since the notion of prophets came up to \u2014 I just love this \u2014 these lines of Cesar Chavez that you had in your book. \u201CI am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally non-violent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us be men.\u201D You noted, when you quoted this, that now we would \u2014 he would say, to be human is to suffer for others. God help us be human. But I mean, I don\u2019t know. I just wanted to throw that out there. Well, I, you know, I got in trouble with that essay on Cesar Chavez, because I don\u2019t make him a saint. Uh, I make him a human being. And none of the prophets are saints. That\u2019s exactly right. Yeah. The ex \u2014 you know, the brilliance of my Catholicism was always to acknowledge that we are failed creatures. Graham Greene writes a novel about Mexico in which the hero is a whiskey priest. Everybody else has left the village. Everybody has escaped. And this priest, who is a drunkard, comes and whispers over the chalice, the blood of Christ, . This is my body, and he\u2019s drunk, but he\u2019s both a failure and a triumph. Look for your saints accordingly. Yeah. Well, I think that\u2019s the last word. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Richard Rodriguez. Richard Rodriguez\u2019 books include: Hunger Of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez; Brown: The Last Discovery Of America; and in 2013, Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography."
