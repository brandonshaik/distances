  "fullText": "The great American experiment with building a multiracial democracy is still in the laboratory. We have got to be willing to see ourselves as part of an experiment that is actively working its way through right now. None of us knows the answer fully, as to how we do this. We stumble. We hold on to each other. We hug each other. We fight with one another in loving ways. But we keep moving and experimenting and trying to figure it out. Vincent Harding, an architect of the civil rights movement, sees this as a challenge for America and the Christian church. I spoke with him together with Phyllis Tickle, another religious elder, for an honest sometimes politically incorrect reflection on coming to terms with racial identity in the church and the world. What might words like repentance or forgiveness mean, culturally, in this moment? These are questions of the emerging church, a loosely-defined movement that crosses generations, theologies and social ideologies in the hope of reimagining Christianity. There\u2019s a difference between repentance and forgiveness and there\u2019s a difference between those in grace. And if we do this thing that Vincent\u2019s talking about, if we refashion this country \u2014 which we\u2019re going to do \u2014 but if we do it without grace, it will be just as clunky and just as unfortunate. And just as many people will get the short end of the stick as has been true in the past. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being.I interviewed these longtime friends and revered elders at the 2013 Wild Goose Festival, a gathering of the emerging church. We spoke early in the morning in an outdoor tent in Hot Springs, North Carolina, in front of hundreds of people. It is such an honor and a pleasure and a thrill to be here in this gorgeous place, and lets just plunge right in. Vincent Harding was a \u2014 is a father of the civil rights movement. He followed that movement to Atlanta, helped co-found the Mennonite House there which was a heart of the philosophy and practice of nonviolence. He started the Veterans of Hope Project at Illiff Seminary in Colorado and he has spent the recent decades since the civil rights movement bringing the lessons and the legacy of what was learned there, spiritually as well as politically, to young people in the contemporary United States. And although Vincent and I had a beautiful, intimate interview, we\u2019ve never met in the flesh, so I just was able to hug him for the first time . Phyllis Tickle was best known when I first met her over a decade ago as the person who had really created the religion department at Publishers Weekly. But something I always also loved about Phyllis was, even though she was doing this lofty work in New York City, her permanent address was always The Farm in Lucy. Phyllis Tickle, the farm in Lucy, Tennessee. She\u2019s a writer and thinker in her own right on prayer and liturgy and theology. And in the cathartic autumn of 2008, she published a sweeping book about the past and future of society and Christianity, which was called The Great Emergence. Now out of the corner of my eye over this past decade, I\u2019ve watched Phyllis become what I\u2019ve thought of as the mother superior of the emerging church movement. I don\u2019t know. Is that a title you would claim? I would love it, but I have no right to it . Thank you. So Vincent something you believe have been become especially passionate about, I don\u2019t know if this has been true forever, but I know recently you\u2019re really concerned about the opportunity we have now in this country perhaps to grow up as a democracy. I wonder how you think about what a robust Christianity has to offer, that kind of moment and that kind of task. Krista, I am still recovering from the joy of seeing you in person for the first time. That\u2019s a way to stall, OK. But it\u2019s not quite a stall and I am \u2014 I think But it\u2019s not quite a stall and I am drinking in the beauty of being with my son and coworker here. And what\u2019s on my mind is very close to what Sister Phyllis is talking about. I think that we are at a point where we may be ready as people of the churches to take seriously the calling that\u2019s in the prologue to the Constitution, which says very clearly that our main job as \u201CWe the People of the United States,\u201D our main job is not to compete with China, not to give Russia another blast from our great horns and certainly not to teach anybody else what democracy is. But that our main job is to create a more perfect union, to develop within this country a recognition that we have been in a state of arrested development as a country. We began in a state of arrested development as a country, because we began talking about establishing freedom and democracy and, at the same time, built into our Constitution the protection of human slavery. We built arrested development into our very beginnings and it is a wonderful opportunity now for the people of God who say again and again the truth will set us free. It is a wonderful opportunity to live that out and to go after that truth about who we really are, about where we really are and about where we need to go.I think one of the other things that the people of God have to look at is what is the difference between the emerging church in America and the emerging population in America? Um, Phyllis, your book is so brilliant and what I think is so important is you have framed your understanding of this moment in the life of the Christian church, of Christianity as a religion. And you talk \u2014 when you talk about the emerging church within that, you know, you began to see something that you call the gathering center. It\u2019s a new center. It doesn\u2019t look anything like the old center looked. So I\u2019m just curious. Tell us a little bit about what you started to see, what you saw, what that looks like and how you\u2019ve watched that emerge. It\u2019s cynical, I know, but there is a certain authority to the cash register. I truly believe in the cash register and when people start spending money for stuff, it tells me that there\u2019s something serious here. And when the books began to go in the early 90s, in the mid 90s, and religion suddenly became \u2014 and you remember this \u2014 the best sellers, then all of a sudden Publishers Weekly, the trade journal, needed coverage of what was happening, \u2019cause there\u2019d been no Religion Department. And in doing the Religion Department work, it dawned on me there is something serious happening here. We really are in a shift and we had been told that by other people, but that\u2026 Joan Chittister said people started to get their church off the shelf. That\u2019s right. They got their church off the shelf, absolutely. We Episcopalians have a wonderful bishop, Mark Dyer, who in 1992 started saying, \u201CIf you want to know what\u2019s happening in the church in the world today, you have to understand that every 500 years we feel compelled to have a giant rummage sale and we\u2019re having one.\u201D But he\u2019s absolutely right. So tell me\u2026 But it\u2019s exciting. The thing is, it\u2019s more exciting to be in what we\u2019re in right now \u2014 the great emergence that we\u2019re going through is analogous more to 2000 years ago when everything shifted. The thing we\u2019re living in now is deeply exciting, deeply threatening and a wonderful opportunity in every way because we know where we are. Those who preceded us didn\u2019t know. We know we\u2019re in it and we have the opportunity and the education with which to prayerfully navigate this stream. It\u2019s an important time. It\u2019s a great time to be alive if you don\u2019t think about it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: on an outdoor stage at the Wild Goose Festival in North Carolina with Emerging church Elder Phyllis Tickle and civil rights veteran Vincent Harding. So, Vincent, you said you\u2019d like us to reflect on the connection between the people of God, between this church that is emerging, and the emerging population. So I just want to invite you to flesh out that question \u2014 draw it out and give us some of your reflections. I am very conscious both as an 82-year-old citizen and as a sometimes-historian of the American society, that we are involved in deep and powerful change, and also aware, as simply a human being, that change is frightening to many of us. And so frightening, we forget that without change there is no life. And when I hear of the emerging church, I put it in my mind and in my heart together with the emerging American nation that is less and less overwhelmingly white. And where does the connection begin for us to think in new ways about who the people of God are. And I think it is terribly important to keep saying to ours \u2014 it is important to keep saying to ourselves, \u201CWe have work to do.\u201D And, I think, for the church that emerges in that kind of spirit, with that kind of consciousness, with that kind of agenda, will have a different future than the church, which does not. There is all I have to say. Um, so I feel like you put words to some important realities that are part of this dynamic. And one thing is naming fear, which is very often inarticulate and unaware of itself, which manifests as denial or aggression. And, yet, as you also noted, this status quo \u2014 it\u2019s not just a way of thinking and it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s often not active, right? It\u2019s not an active stance. It is, however, embodied. It\u2019s embodied in our communities. It\u2019s \u2014 this way of being is in the way we\u2019ve all moved through the world. It\u2019s in the world we\u2019ve known. I think that\u2019s such an important thing to name. Um, what you also did, Vincent, is you posed some questions about how Christians might take up this problem, this reality, this challenge, which are very different from the way this discussion gets framed in our culture, right? You know, what I\u2019m aware of, especially recently, is we take up the subject of race and of difference at extremely fraught moments. Right? Like the trial of George Zimmerman. We don\u2019t know how to take up this huge exploration in an active way as an ongoing thing. So I just want to, you know \u2014 and I think I want to probe further and also pull Phyllis into this, as a white woman of the deep South, right? Well, what I wanted to \u2014 I totally agree with what Vince just said, except I want to say, you know, the last 50 years, um, it\u2019s not just race. The dominance was white, male, straight. Uh, and we need to \u2014 we need to put the whole thing \u2014 the whole pot is boiling. And I know you meant that. And also the disabled, uh, who also have been marginalized in many ways, and who, in the last 50 years, are coming into their own. So what we\u2019re talking about, I think Vince is absolutely right, is a society in upheaval. But the point that you made that I\u2019d really like to go to first is that much of what \u2014 if we\u2019re not careful we\u2019re going to end up making social policies and political policies that any good secular humanist would make simply because it makes social sense. It does not make political sense to keep somebody suppressed. It just doesn\u2019t. Uh, it\u2019s too expensive. It doesn\u2019t make sense to leave the homeless out in the street. If you\u2019re going to be just cynical about it. Right. It costs more to take care of them after they\u2019ve caught pneumonia or whatever it is, then it would have cost to house them in the first place. So, and that\u2019s good, communist thinking. That\u2019s good socialist thinking. That\u2019s good agnostic thinking. We\u2019re Christian, and if we\u2019re Christian, we have to go at it from the Christian point of view. We don\u2019t have to enforce that politically. But we have to be really sure that \u2026 Yeah. Like, so what is the Christian exploration? Right. So how does the Christian exploration of this reframe what\u2019s at stake and what\u2019s to be worked on? OK. So emergent sensibility needs to be definitely Christ centered. The miracles he did, the action he took \u2014 the actions he took, were all done with a loving concern for the victim, whoever the victim was, but with enormous ability to speak out to those who had victimized. Because he or she also is \u2014 and you made this point, Krista, \u2014 is to a large extent also the victim of the society which we are. It\u2019s not as if anybody goes around, gets up this morning and say, \u201CBoy, I\u2019m going to be prejudiced this morning.\u201D We don\u2019t do that. You know, we get up and we groan and we brush our teeth and we think, \u201CI\u2019m going to go forth and do.\u201D And it\u2019s only as we become informed, about what\u2019s going on around us and about the very things that you\u2019re talking about, about the great emerge, our emergent society or whatever you want to call it, that we become able to understand the Christ call to both the victim and the victimizer. And I\u2019m going to shut up, because I\u2019m repeating myself. You know, Vincent, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that. What is the that, now? Oh, you\u2019re good. Well, the idea that part of a distinctively Christian religious faithful approach to this quandary would be about a different kind of caring attention to the victimizer. I mean, it\u2019s true that in our political life, our social life, this get\u2019s turned \u2014 get\u2019s \u2014 this is a discussion about \u2014 You probably can\u2019t do it socially (inaudible). It\u2019s a discussion about racism, right? Yes, that\u2019s right. And then you\u2019re on one side of that or you\u2019re not. I think the obvious approach to the question would be that there\u2019s no way to be serious about following Jesus without calling for concern and compassion for the enemy. But immediately, as I say that, I am pushed to urge all who claim to be followers of Jesus to jump as quickly as possible from making that simply a personal kind of story, to asking, \u201CAnd what does that have to do with the enemies in Afghanistan, and all over the world, that we have declared enemies? Do we want to deal with them in compassion as well? Or do we want to do them in as quickly as we possibly can?\u201D I think that we\u2019ve got to keep these conversations in conversation with each other, and not just have some nice talk about what we should do with those bad people over there who are doing bad things to the poor, to the homeless, et cetera, and not talk about what we as a country and what we as citizens of this country are doing to the people we call \u201Cbad guys\u201D all over the world? So, Krista, I insist on complicating this question and not letting us get away with an easy, just strictly personal, one-to-one sort of conversation about things. May I just, uh, yeah, except, there\u2019s a danger. I agree with you in theory. There is a danger, however, in taking it so global, so international that we wash our hands, congratulating ourselves on our good intentions. There is an immediacy of the problem that requires the immediacy of attention, without it\u2019s dilution \u2014 or, dilution is not the right word. What we\u2019re here dealing with, right here in this country, needs more immediate attention, I think, from Christians. The other, it will ripple out. If we do our job here at home, it will ripple out in who we are globally. And we \u2014 I\u2019m not saying we should not be concerned. Obviously, we should. I deplore what we\u2019ve done. I deplore what we\u2019ve done for the last 15 years, maybe longer than that, internationally. But I don\u2019t \u2014 we can divert our attention to that which we can\u2019t fix in such a way that we don\u2019t deal earnestly with that which we can fix, which is right here in our place. Which is, I think, that\u2019s important about keeping the conversations in conversation with each other at all times. Right. Um, so let me just ask this big question and, you know, maybe start with you, Vincent. Um, if you could give a speech to the nation, if you could wave a wand, if you could restart \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say our discussion about this, about race, about difference, about how we\u2019ve become a truly multicultural society \u2014 I want to say our encounter with this, um, where would it begin? I think, Krista, that the historian in me would insist that we become mature human beings and a mature nation, rather than the kind of teenage nation, by acknowledging how we messed up from the very beginning \u2014 and not only messed up ourselves, but messed up all kinds of other people as well, including the people who used to occupy this space. I would say that I would want us, and I keep using us, I would want us to acknowledge how we got started. And to move then, not to guilt and constant talk about guilt, but move then to repentance. And try to figure out how do we turn around from the pathway that that got us started on to the pathway of becoming loving children of God \u2014 to really go towards building a new nation with a whole new set of understandings about what is it that God wants of us. That, I think, is a conversation that would be of great help to those who call themselves Christian and those who are part of the nation that does not acknowledge that definition at all. You can listen again and share this conversation with Vincent Harding and Phyllis Tickle \u2013 at onbeing.org.Coming up\u2026repentance, forgiveness, and the challenge of common life. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with Vincent Harding and Phyllis Tickle. They were invited, as wise elders, to begin each morning of the 2013 Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina. Wild Goose is a Celtic metaphor for the unpredictable spirit of God. And this is a gathering of what is called the \u201Cemerging Church\u201D \u2013 reimagining Christianity for a new moment. Phyllis Tickle is a scholar and the original religion editor of Publisher\u2019s Weekly; she\u2019s considered by many to be the \u201Cmother superior\u201D of the emergent church. Vincent Harding was a leader of non-violent resistance in the 1960s and a friend and speechwriter to Martin Luther King Jr. He now leads the National Council of Elders, an organization that mentors young people and leaders, with the wisdom gained from the civil rights movement. I went on a civil rights pilgrimage with your friend, John Lewis, earlier this year, with the Faith & Politics Institute. I think there\u2019s some people from Faith & Politics here. It was an extraordinary experience. And one of the things I just began to learn, which I never really learned in school, was the gift of non-violence that that movement made to this country. And I really don\u2019t think we have a memory of that now. What I hear you talking about is the gift of repentance that people of faith, the emerging church, could make to this nation. That\u2019s work. And it\u2019s also a commitment of time, right? It\u2019s going to be generations before that kind of, uh, that is really come to fruition. It\u2019s going to be working generations. Yeah. Not just generations, but working generations. Commitment to give ourselves fully and deeply to the task of creating something new, not just assuming that by sitting around the new is going to come. Only as we, strengthened by the grace of God, say there must be something new and we must help to embody it and to create it. And it seems to me that as we bring that faith energy to the task, then we have a new kind of situation. What are you thinking over there, Phyllis? Oh, I\u2019m listening. I\u2019m enjoying. He\u2019s two years older than I so that means I can listen to him as his \u2026 Yeah, he is. He\u2019s much more mature, it\u2019s true. He\u2019s more mature. I can listen. He\u2019s got me topped by two years. No, there \u2014 I agree. I would put a caveat or two. My caveat, first, is that we\u2019re post-Christendom. And that maybe is not a familiar concept to everyone, but we\u2019re post-Christendom, in which case, uh, because of that \u2026 And just say a little bit about what you mean when you say that. Well, it means that, basically, in 325, when the church, forgive me, got in bed with the empire \u2014 and we called it Constantine, and he was a good lover, apparently, because we sure liked him. And we stayed with him and we stayed with him until about 30, 40 years ago. It\u2019s very dangerous for one\u2019s soul to be part of a religion that\u2019s socially acceptable. It just really is. And we had 1700 years of being socially acceptable. And we\u2019re just beginning to find out what it means, um, to be a freestanding voice that can speak to the empire. We don\u2019t have to have the president announce who\u2019s going to be the Pope or to lay hands on the new Archbishop of Canterbury. In England, you still have to have the Queen sign of, because they\u2019re not quite as post-Christendom as we are. So we\u2019re tracking as two different entities, the politics and the Christian body. And increasingly, unless I\u2019m crazy, the Christian body will become more and more of a cohesive thing, making it possible to do much of what Vincent\u2019s talking about. And that will come through emergence. There\u2019s no question it will. But I think also, we need to understand that what we\u2019re repenting for, let\u2019s be careful. What we\u2019re repenting for is zillions of years of not making every creature we saw a human being. And so it\u2019s not as if the Caucasians or somebody came over here and settled this country in a vacuum. They brought with them the traditions of their culture. They brought with them all of the things that had made them. And to turn and blame bothers me. It, even, as a woman, to turn and blame men bothers me. It\u2019s not the guys\u2019 fault. We had a different culture. So I think part of what we have to do is begin by forgiving those who got us in this mess, realizing that it was not their mess. They became the last actualizers of it in many ways, but they were the inheritors of centuries and centuries. And until we can \u2014 I think, until we can look with grace at all of history and say, \u201CYes. Dear Lord I am so sorry that it was this way. I\u2019m so sorry that my part of humanity did this to that part of humanity. But I understand, I\u2019m not going to blame them. They, too, were the victim of a system.\u201D Then the question becomes, so how do we make a better system so that our kids\u2019 great-great-great-great-great-great grandchildren don\u2019t look back and say, \u201CGreat-great-great-great-great-great grandpa was a huge sinner.\u201D When, in actuality, he was the product of who we are and who we made him. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Mm-hmm. Uh, we can \u2014 I\u2019m not a feminist. You can\u2019t have seven children by the same man and be credible as a feminist, I discovered years ago. It just won\u2019t play in Poughkeepsie, and so \u2014 especially staying with him for 58 years. Let me tell you, it takes a lot of imagination. Anyway, it has nothing to do with anything. But you can\u2019t turn and blame guys for what they did to my great-great grandma, because it was a male-oriented society. Mm-hmm. If I were gay right now, I would have to go to my prayers saying, \u201CPlease, God, let me understand that those who \u2014 \u201D If I were transgendered, I\u2019d be in my prayer booth almost all day long saying, \u201CPlease, God, forgive even the gays and lesbians who are denigrating me.\u201D You know, uh, it\u2019s forgiveness. And I think what you\u2019re saying is really important. And, as I say, it\u2019s not spoken, right? It\u2019s not spoken. It\u2019s not popular. What you\u2019re saying \u2014 can I say this? What you\u2019re saying is not PC. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s not PC at all. I\u2019m sorry. I know it isn\u2019t, but \u2026 But, no, it\u2019s great. But what I want to \u2014 so what\u2019s the bridge? So you \u2014 there has to be forgiveness. You know, and Vincent said this is not about guilt and blame. It\u2019s about repentance. And so what\u2019s the bridge between the forgiveness of that which was, of which you are a part, and being a force for creating a new world \u2014 a new reality. I don\u2019t want to play at words, but forgiveness involves forgiving \u2014 repentance involves what\u2019s happening right now and what I\u2019m part of. Forgiveness involves the grace of looking back at that from which we\u2019ve all come and say, \u201CPlease may it, in some way, become the ongoing part of the kingdom of God while I\u2019m here.\u201D And no, it\u2019s not PC. But it true \u2014 as you can tell, it worries me. And why be 80 if you can\u2019t say what worries you, right? There\u2019s a certain impunity. But there\u2019s a difference between repentance and forgiveness and there\u2019s a difference between those in grace. And I think grace only comes in prayer, but it also comes when both repentance and forgiveness have come into full play. And if we do this thing that Vincent\u2019s talking about, if we refashion this country \u2014 which we\u2019re going to do \u2014 but if we do it without grace, it will be just as clunky and just as unfortunate. And just as many people will get the short end of the stick as has been true in the past. I think our only hope is prayer \u2014 we agree in every way, I think, on that \u2014 is prayer and\u2014 doing things like we\u2019re doing right here. And also, I think, maybe talking straight. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today on an outdoor stage with two elders of contemporary Christian life \u2013 scholar and writer Phyllis Tickle and civil rights veteran Vincent Harding. Let me pick up from my younger sister here. He is going to hold that against me. No, I\u2019m going to hold it very close to me. OK, that\u2019s a deal, brother. It\u2019s actually two years and ten months. Phyllis said that what we are doing here is very important. Yes, it is. I\u2019d like to encourage us, Krista, to recognize that we can\u2019t move to new ways unless we\u2019re willing to experiment and try out things that we haven\u2019t experienced before. And maybe failed along the way. Absolutely. The willingness to fail is the mark of genius\u2026 Right. \u2026because you can\u2019t create anything new if you are tied in by this fear of failure. Wild Goose, itself, is an experiment. The idea of talking about where we might be going together with two old folks and a somewhat younger folks, sitting in front of an audience of 400 or 500 people, does that work? How is that? Well we won\u2019t know if it works, unless we try it. Then, after this is over, as I understand it, there\u2019s probably going to be a smaller group continuing to wrestle with these issues. I started out this morning at breakfast in a conversation with five people. What I\u2019m trying to say is this: Please do not look for any miraculous, quick answers to how we work towards this new being and new society, which is, we need both of these things. We\u2019ve got to figure out how we work towards them. And I want to encourage you in a way that I was encouraged recently by one of my elders, coworkers, in an organization that some of us have begun to put together, called the council of elders. My brother wrote this letter to me and said, \u201CVincent, we need to keep remembering that the great American experiment with building a multiracial democracy is still in the laboratory.\u201D We have got to be willing to see ourselves as part of an experiment that is actively working its way through right now. None of us knows the answer fully, as to how we do this. We stumble. We hold on to each other. We hug each other. We fight with one another in loving ways. But we keep moving and experimenting and trying to figure it out. I would want, more than anything else, Krista, to encourage our sisters and brothers here, not to feel that the task is so great that there is nothing we can do, but to recognize that the task is so great that we must be doing everything that we can do. Finding a way, exploring a way, encouraging people to talk about this wherever we are. Not letting people sit down and talk about football and basketball or even church politics, without talking about this issue of how do we create a new, multiracial nation that is filled with democracy, filled with compassion, and filled with children who are coming up in a new way. How do we take all of those things on consciously, intentionally, making mistakes and, at the same time, discovering the beauty that God has in store for us? My own deepest source of strength in this is the word that most of us received from the one that we say we follow, when he guaranteed us that if we are willing to hunger and thirst for the right way, for the way of righteousness, if we don\u2019t back off, if we don\u2019t give up, if we don\u2019t look for the easy way, but let the hunger and thirst really drive us, we will be filled. That is what keeps me going, that promise that if I am willing to let the hunger continue to drive my life, the filling is assured. And I have found it in many, many ways to be true. And I\u2019m willing to go with it the rest of my life, not backing off, pushing, moving, searching, holding on to others, and seeing, as the old black song said, seeing what the end will be. And I\u2019m looking forward to that myself right now. Yeah, right. Um, I think I want to close with just one final question. I want to invoke an image that another great elder of our time, Joan Chittister, gave me. Let\u2019s bring a Catholic voice in here. She likes to tell \u2014 I find great, great hope in this story. She talked about how she often clings to the knowledge that when St. Benedict was alive \u2014 was it fifth, sixth, century, is that right \u2014 that The New York Times equivalent of the fifth, sixth century Rome did not have a headline that said \u201CBenedict Writes Rule.\u201D You know? It was a little group of crazy people. I think he was \u2014 attempted, you know, one of the first communities he founded, they tried to poison him. Absolutely. It did not go well for a lot of it. Absolutely. Subiaco was bad. Did not go well and, you know, this group of outliers, though, created something that a thousand years later helps keep civilization alive. And I love to think about that and the fact that even I \u2014 from my vantage point with a power, you know, within media \u2014 I do not know what is happening right now in some corner of the world that\u2019s going to keep civilization alive 50 years from now or 1,000 years from now. However \u2026 Hear, hear. \u2014 the two of you \u2026 Absolutely, you\u2019re right. \u2014 and that gives me hope. You\u2019re right. Um, the two of you have lived a long time and you have a keen eye and ear. And I do want to ask you, as we close, you know, is there something you are watching, looking at or listening for, or looking for that keeps you going, that may not be on all of our radars? Or, you know, where would you want us to direct our attention? One of the things that comes most immediately to my mind, Krista, is the City of Detroit, which up until yesterday morning almost, was described to us only in terms of the degradation that was going on there and all the loss and all of the blight. But for reasons that I don\u2019t have time to go into now, I have been blessed with the privilege of actually knowing people in Detroit who have been living in hope and who have been convinced that the moment that they are living in now is a moment of great danger. and, at the same time, a moment of tremendous opportunity. And so, in the midst of the falling-apart of Detroit, there are people from a variety of motivations, including deeply spiritual motivations, who are coming together to build on that broken land \u2014 to build new settings, to build new institutions, to build new gardens, to build the lives of new children. And they are building a new Detroit in the midst of all of the stuff that we hear about the death of Detroit. Life, life, insistent life is growing up in that city. And I am personally deeply encouraged by it and keep looking at it every time I can get a chance to. Thank you. Phyllis, what are you looking at? Well, I, um, I think his metaphor of Detroit is absolutely. I think we can look at the church and look at thousands of groups in pubs and in old yoga clubs and in houses and, uh, yes, all over the world. Uh, there\u2019s a meeting in a couple of weeks in Bangkok where emergence folk are coming from around the world for the first time to be able to say, \u201CHere we are, from our various continents.\u201D Uh, huge hope. And I would like to say, if I may, um, part of the hope for this whole thing is the fact that grandparents are here. I love looking out and seeing some white hair without having to look in the mirror to see it. The carrying of the tradition. Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget that the Abrahamic tradition, the Christian tradition, which says that every human being is a human being. And that\u2019s the fundamental thing, isn\u2019t it? Every human being is a human. I look at you and there is Christ in you or there is a potential Christian in you or there is a flaming Christian in you. How do I know? And the third thing is, and I think it\u2019s probably the most important. We\u2019ve had a \u2014 significant shift in the last hundred years as part of the lead-up to where we are right now, in which in many ways we are arriving at a completion of the Trinity. From Azusa Street and the coming of the Holy Spirit amongst those people at Azusa Street in 1907, uh, we have had the growth of Pentecostalism and of charismatic Christianity, the Renewalists they\u2019re called, so that in many ways we now engage the Holy Spirit massively and the Holy Spirit engages us massively, in ways that, up until now, we\u2019ve not been able to engage \u2014 corporately, we did have. But the coming of the Holy Spirit, the completion of the Trinity in the everyday practice of everyday Christians is, I think, where it is. I think that\u2019s our seed, the thing that is going to really happen. Um, I\u2019m not a Pentecostal, but I\u2019m a great \u2014 I\u2019m very aware historically. Our theology is changing as well. Or our theology is blooming. It is the same theology we had. It is now blooming and coming into fruition and maturing. Yeah, you\u2019ve both named two very important realities, that there\u2019s life in Detroit and that the face of Christianity in this century is largely and increasingly Pentecostal. There are more Pentecostals in the world than there are citizens in the United States. OK. And if you put Pentecostals and Renewalists together, they would be the fourth largest religion in the world. So I just want to say in closing that, um, sitting with the two of you has been such an important remembering that we need our elders. An important piece of truth that Western culture forgot. I mean, because \u2014 and just like \u2014 I mean, when we talk about creating a more multiracial and multiethnic society, we\u2019re talking about becoming more whole. And I think living cross-generationally is also about becoming more whole again. It\u2019s been such an honor. So thank you, Phyllis Tickle, and thank you, Vincent Harding.
