  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CTwo Narratives: Reflections on the Israeli Palestinian Present.\u201D My guests this week and next present views of life in one land that cannot, at present, be reconciled, but their accounts of what is at stake provide substance for our understanding, as Hamas forms a Palestinian Cabinet and Israel prepares for a critical election. Religion is a primary source of conflict in their region, my guests say, and it cannot be bracketed out of politics and peace negotiations. I think we need to start taking religion seriously. It\u2019s terrifying, especially when you confront this tsunami of fundamentalism, but we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with reality unless we get rid of our wishful thinking. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. For the next two weeks, we\u2019ll explore the intersection of the spiritual and the political entrenched in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will not seek to reconcile what cannot be reconciled at present. We\u2019ll listen to understand the difficulty of reaching peace in a land that its inhabitants, on both sides of conflict, consider holy. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, the first of a series, \u201CTwo Narratives: Reflections on the Israeli Palestinian Present.\u201D The modern state of Israel was founded in the aftermath of war in 1948. Other wars and agreements have shifted its borders since, but the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians is locked inside larger histories, among these the Biblical drama of ancient Israel and the tragedy of the 20th-century Holocaust; the politics of the British Empire and the Cold War; the histories of Christianity and Islam and of the disparate, intertwining cultures we now call the Middle East. The Oslo Peace Process of the 1990s initiated a gradual process towards Palestinian autonomy and governance in portions of the long contested West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Oslo raised hopes within the Palestinian and Israeli publics for an enduring peace. The dashing of those hopes accounts in part for the uncertainty and bitterness of recent times. On September 13, 1993, Israel and the PLO had formally recognized each other and signed the Oslo Agreement, which was to provide self government to the Palestinians. Rabin and Arafat vowed to end the conflict, now nearly a century old. We, who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today, enough of blood and tears. Let me address the people of Israel. The difficult decision we reached together was one that required great and exceptional courage. A brand-new beginning after decades of bitterness and suffering. The handshakes in Washington pointed to an era of cooperation. But the opponents of peace were quick to respond. Suicide bomb attacks against Israeli civilians triggered outrage and second thoughts. One of his closest assistants said that it took Arafat a year to understand that he didn\u2019t get a state. The murder of worshipers in Hebron was another brutal reminder of the awful passions generated by long years of conflict. In 1994, Rabin, Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize\u2026 Another round of suicide bombs tips the electoral balance. The result in national elections was agonizingly close, but the opponents of Oslo won. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared that Israel will not abandon any of its Jewish settlements in the territories\u2026 Speaking recently, Mr. Netanyahu called Oslo a flawed, evil accord. What began so brightly looks less and less convincing. Right-wing political leader Ariel Sharon, protected by about a thousand Israeli police, entered the Temple Mount and it was instantly seen as a provocation by Muslims\u2026 Then a new intifada would erupt, this time with deadly weapons in the hands of both sides \u2014 the Palestinians and Israelis farther from agreement than ever before. This week and next, we\u2019ll explore this history as seen through Palestinian and Israeli eyes. We begin today with the perspective of Yossi Klein Halevi, an Israeli Jew and the author of At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A Jew\u2019s Search for God with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land. Halevi\u2019s own life has been a prism for some of the larger conflicts in which current Israeli Palestinian tensions are held. He was born in the United States, the son of a Holocaust survivor. His father raised him with a memory of the Jewish people as a besieged, pursued, hated people that could never find its place with the rest of humanity. As a teenager, Halevi was briefly an adherent of a Jewish extremist movement and a leader in a militant student group set on freeing Jews held captive in the Soviet Union. He renounced violence as he discovered his spiritual homeland in Israel. He emigrated, began his family in Jerusalem and became a respected journalist, both in Israel and the United States. I first interviewed Yossi Klein Halevi in the months immediately after 9/11. I wondered now about his reaction to dramatic, overlapping events of recent years and weeks. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon departed Israeli politics suddenly by way of illness. A former hard-line general, Sharon recently took the step of forcibly evacuating right-wing Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. But Sharon also set in motion the construction of a physical barrier of separation \u2014 in places, an electronic security fence, in others, a wall over 20 feet high that traces contested borders with the West Bank. On the other side of that wall, the Islamist movement Hamas won a government majority in recent Palestinian elections. Hamas was a chief architect of the five-year suicide bombing campaign known as the second intifada that began in 2000 and targeted Israeli civilians. The second intifada hardened many newly moderate Israelis towards the Oslo process, including Yossi Klein Halevi. Though after the first Palestinian popular uprising that had erupted in 1987, Halevi, like many Israelis, had re-examined his own attitudes and Israeli policies towards the Palestinian people. He even undertook a now unimaginable journey that led to his 2001 book about knowing and praying with Palestinian Muslims and Christians. In many ways, that was a magical journey. I was admitted into Sufi mosques in the Palestinian territories in Gaza and the West Bank, and I went as a religious Jew, as an identified and a visible religious Jew, wearing a kippa, the skullcap, and I was accepted by Sufi Palestinian communities, admitted into the prayer line and into the Sufi dance, the zikr. And there was this moment where I felt I could touch Islam, where I could, in some way, embrace Islam and feel at home in a mosque. And my goal, as an Israeli on this journey, was to test the possibility of Israel becoming at home in the Middle East, in the culture of the Middle East \u2014 and there is no Middle Eastern culture without Islam. And for me to learn to overcome my fear of the mosque and to become at home in Muslim devotion was a psychological breakthrough for me and, I feel, a spiritual breakthrough. And the tragedy for me, since this terror war began five years ago, is that Islam has receded since the intifada began, is that Islam, which is all around me \u2014 I live at the edge of Jerusalem on the next hill, there are half a dozen mosques, and I wake up to the sound of the muezzin, and I go to sleep to the sound of the muezzin, it penetrates through the day \u2014 and yet Islam has now receded into intangibility and inaccessibility. And there is an invisible wall, and soon there\u2019s going to be a tangible wall. Coming to your neighborhood, the wall. Yes, apparently it will be right outside my window. I\u2019m at the very edge of the city. Let me push you a little bit. I mean \u2014 and I realize I\u2019m watching all of this from this very safe and luxurious distance, right? But with power, which, I think, Hamas did not even expect to get to the extent that it received it in this election, comes a sense of responsibility. And as Hamas leaders have been interviewed by American journalists these recent weeks, you know, American journalists quote at them the lines from their foundational documents, which call for the destruction of the state of Israel. And for the mass murder of the Jewish people, wherever they are. Right, okay. I mean, maybe this is a completely false analogy. But, I mean, I look at someone like Ariel Sharon, and, I mean, there is someone, who personally, in his lifetime has undergone a kind of evolution, from exercising power, in one way, and interpreting power to different approaches. I mean, do you think it\u2019s conceivable that that could also be something that happens with Hamas \u2014 that there is an evolution that comes with power? Anything is possible. As we say in the Middle East, God is great. Realistically, not in this generation. You know, it\u2019s not to say that individual members or even leaders of Hamas are incapable of evolving. Everyone is not only capable of evolving but, ultimately, I believe will evolve, in this lifetime or another. But if you\u2019re asking me whether Hamas, at this phase of its collective evolution, is capable of leaving behind its theology that is rooted in hatred of the Jewish people and the state of Israel and adopt a pragmatic attitude, which means undoing not just their politics but their theology, my answer is absolutely not. The Sharon analogy, I think, is in some ways, only reinforces that because Sharon was a secular man, and Sharon was never really a believer in the biblical right of the Jewish people to all of the land of Israel. Okay. He was a security-minded general and then a politician whose only interest was keeping Israel safe. When he realized that the settlements had turned into a liability and that it was impossible to stop a Palestinian state, his goal became trying to shepherd Israel through the transition period toward a Palestinian state and keeping Israel as safe as possible. Now, the religious right in Israel has not produced the equivalent of Sharon because their ideology is rooted in theology. And I think we need to start taking religion seriously and religious commitment seriously, for better and for worse. And that is something that Americans and even American leaders and negotiators try to bracket out of the conversation. Exactly, exactly. And it\u2019s terrifying, especially when you confront this tsunami of fundamentalism in the Middle East. But we\u2019re not going to be able to deal with reality unless we get rid of our wishful thinking. I also feel, Krista, that that\u2019s a spiritual imperative. It\u2019s not just a political imperative. To get rid of wishful thinking? Yes. Okay. There is a wonderful story from Ramakrishna, the 19th-century Hindu saint. One of his disciples came back from the market and brought back these broken pots that he\u2019d bought. And he\u2019d been cheated by one of the vendors, and Ramakrishna said to him, \u201CJust because you\u2019re on the spiritual path doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a fool\u201D. And I\u2019ve thought of that story over the last five years over and over again when I come up against Western attitudes toward the Middle East. And I have to respect the intelligence of Palestinian voters, and I also have to take them at their word, and; you know, imagine, if in the upcoming Israeli elections, we were to elect a government, a party that calls for the physical annihilation of the Palestinian people Even if that\u2019s not what \u2014 you could parse that and say that\u2019s not what people were voting about. You\u2019re saying that would still matter? It would still matter, and I think it\u2019s time for the international community to start asking the same kinds of hard questions to the Palestinians, which were rightfully addressed to Israel during the first intifada before a majority of Israelis came to the conclusion that the Palestinians deserve a state. Now is the time for those hard questions to be asked to the Palestinians, and that means listening carefully with respect, but also not with selective hearing \u2014 listening and understanding that not all that\u2019s being said conforms to what we wish were being said. Israeli journalist and author Yossi Klein Halevi. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, the first in a series seeking understanding into the contrasting ways Israelis and Palestinians tell the story of their history and present. This conflict was, for many years, a zero-sum game between two peoples, neither of whom recognized the legitimacy of the other to nationhood. Most Israelis regarded Palestinian nationalism as an invention of the Arab world intended only to destroy Israel. There are 22 Arab countries. They don\u2019t need country number 23. That was the standard Israeli attitude. And of course on the Palestinian side, in the Arab world Israel was seen as either the last gasp of Western colonialism or as a modern-day version of the Crusades rather than what Israel in fact really is, which is the expression of an indigenous people returning home. And until the two peoples can see the legitimacy of the other\u2019s right to define themselves as a nation, there won\u2019t be peace. And that, for you, you see that as a prerequisite for true change? There can be no reconciliation until that happens. The only reason the Israeli public came to endorse the Oslo process was because most of us came to the painful realization that this is a conflict between two legitimate narratives, between right and right. And until we see the beginnings of a serious Palestinian debate about who are the Jews \u2014 are we crusaders, are we colonialists, or are we a fellow traumatized indigenous people \u2014 and if we begin to see that kind of debate happening within Palestinian society then I will begin to be optimistic. You said to me once that something that happened among Israelis, after that first intifada that you just mentioned, was that you feel that Israelis began to perceive themselves and to behave less like victims and more like survivors. Now I hear that in what you\u2019re saying about your perception of where the Palestinians are now. But what you also have admitted is that compromise is something that people can do from a position of strength. And I think when the world looks at the Palestinians, these are not people in a position of strength just economically, to begin with, but in every other way. Yes. There\u2019s no question that it was a lot easier for me as an Israeli as part of the winning side, the side that had created a state and a thriving economy and a strong military presence, to develop empathy as much as I could for the Palestinian narrative, to try to expand my own understanding of the Israeli-Arab conflict and incorporate how Palestinians view the conflict. That kind of generosity is easier for the winning side. The tragedy, though, is that the Oslo process offered the Palestinian people empowerment with tremendous backing by the international community. Just think what the Kurds or the Tibetans or, if you want to go back to the 1960s, the Biafrans, all of those disenfranchised peoples without a state, what those peoples could have done with an Oslo process. And today we would be in an entirely different Middle East if there had been a Palestinian leadership that was the equivalent of Yitzhak Rabin, for example. Rabin told the Israeli people that the dream of greater Israeli is over. Arial Sharon said it at the U.N. six months ago. He said the Palestinians deserve a state. There has not been one Palestinian leader \u2014 never mind Hamas \u2014 from Fatah, who has told the Palestinian people the dream of greater Palestine is over. There are two peoples in this land. We need to share the land. The Palestinian people have never heard that in Arabic from their own leaders. So that a tremendous historical moment of empowerment was squandered. You wrote in your book in 2001, after your journey where you had wanted to understand and pray and, sort of, move towards rather than away from Palestinians and Islam in your part of the world, you wrote, \u201CI insist on revering Islam and its fearless heart.\u201D That was that quality of fearlessness that you found that had a dark side and also a side that you knew you had to, that you wanted to revere. And you wrote, \u201CThe fanatics will not deprive me of that victory.\u201D I mean, have they now? Basically no. And there have been opportunities even in these last five years of terror. A couple years ago, I was part of a joint Arab-Jewish group that went to Auschwitz. This was an initiative by Muslim and Christian Arab-Israelis, Palestinian citizens of Israeli, as an overture to Jewish society to study the Holocaust. It was also meant as a repudiation of the growing Holocaust denial in much of the Muslim world and an attempt to together go on a pilgrimage to Auschwitz. We spent four days in Poland together. We were about 500 people, all told. That\u2019s a huge group, 500 people. It was a huge group. And it was half Jews and half Muslims, or else as Christians were there, too. Yes. I\u2019d say we were about 300 or 350 people from Israel with another 150 people who came from France with a very similar makeup of Muslims, Christians and Jews. And those were some of the most powerful four days of my life. And for me as the son of a Holocaust survivor, it required an enormous effort to trust Muslim and Christian Arabs with my trauma. And by the same token, it required an enormous effort and courage on the part of Palestinian-Israelis to reach out and empathize with the Jewish suffering while their people were suffering and while we were, in effect, in war with each other. So that was a moment where I felt that the fanatics had not deprived me of my capacity to continue revering Islam and to be receptive to those kinds of experiences. You wrote a diary or an essay, what you called an Auschwitz diary, after that experience. And I thought this was such a striking image. You talked about being in Auschwitz and, you know, Arabs were comforting Jews and Jews were weeping on the shoulder of this Christian leader who\u2019d brought you there, who\u2019d organized this. Yes. And you wrote that when you began, you confessed you had wanted Arabs to emerge from this journey understanding about what the Holocaust means for Jews and also for the state of Israeli. And you wrote, \u201CNow those expectations sound vulgar. For now, I want nothing more than to be together with these people in this place.\u201D I mean, just that image, what I wondered, and again, this is me from this safe distance of America, if that could not be an image for a different kind of future, just simply being together without having reconciled everything. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the journey to Auschwitz happened as a result of an initiative by Arab-Israeli citizens. That\u2019s because even after the security fence or wall is going to be built between Israeli and Palestine, we will still be together on this side of the boundary, Arab Israelis and Jewish Israelis, so that we need to stand together and figure out how to create a civic society together. The question of how to stand together with Palestinians, which really was the basis of my journey into Palestinian Islam and Christianity, was exactly that, to see whether we could stand together in prayer, stand together before God. And the tragedy now is that after all that\u2019s happened here, and now with the wall rising as the physical expression of the psychological wall that\u2019s been here now for the last five years, it\u2019s just not possible, even physically possible, anymore for Israelis and Palestinians to stand together. We don\u2019t have any physical ground on which to stand together anymore. I do have ground on which to stand with my fellow citizens who are Muslim and Christian. And for now, that\u2019s the best I can do. But that remains a very strong commitment. Let\u2019s talk about Israeli society and what this does inside you and inside Jewish Israelis. And I have just recently seen pictures of that wall. I spent eight years of my life in Berlin living in a city with a wall. I mean, the wall in Berlin just looks like child\u2019s play compared to this wall in Israel. It\u2019s so much higher. And, you know, one question that would occur to me, we said a moment ago you had said that Israelis had stopped being victims, many, and had become survivors. Have Israelis again become victims? Or maybe that\u2019s not the analysis. But what does that wall do to you? Well, for me personally it\u2019s the antithesis of everything that I hoped to achieve in my journey into Palestinian society six years ago. My goal was to try to find a way of personally feeling at home in the Middle East. And now this barrier is the clearest indication that I\u2019m not part of the Middle East. The Middle East has rejected me. And now Israel has reciprocated. And I can\u2019t bear looking at that wall. But I also know that that security barrier is going to keep my family reasonably safe. And I can\u2019t tell you what hell these last five years have been in Jerusalem raising three children, two teenagers, who go out on weekends downtown. And there\u2019s no way you can keep kids home, even in a war zone. And the suicide bombings, the suicide bombers, went for the clubs and the pubs, the discos, the buses. And who rides buses? It\u2019s working-class people and teenagers, kids. So, the first instinctive response that I have to that wall is horror at what that wall represents, which really is the end, at least for the foreseeable future, of my dreams, of Zionism\u2019s dreams, of normalizing the Jewish people, of restoring us to the Middle East in some kind of a condition of normalcy. And the second instinctive response that I have is \u201Cthank God,\u201D gratitude that the Israeli army figured out a way to keep the killers out of the clubs and the buses that my kids are on every day.

Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CTwo Narratives: Reflections on the Israeli Palestinian Present.\u201D Any discussion, any study of the history and present of this region yields irreconcilable narratives of the same lived events. We\u2019re listening this hour to journalist Yossi Klein Halevi\u2019s perceptions and perspectives as an Israeli Jew. We\u2019re seeking to understand the difficulty of reaching resolution in a land that its inhabitants on both sides of conflict consider holy. Next week in the same spirit we\u2019ll hear Palestinian perspectives. Yossi Klein Halevi has been describing to me his disillusionment of recent years. I wondered if he remains involved with the conciliatory project, Open House, with which he\u2019s been publicly associated. Open House seeks to improve social services for Arab citizens in the Israeli town of Ramle and to provide a place for encounter and cooperation between Jewish and Arab citizens there. Ramle is home to many new Jewish immigrants from Africa and the former Soviet Union, and, like the whole of Israel, its population is about 20 percent Arab, mostly Palestinian. You know, I\u2019m always searching for the stories that aren\u2019t being told and that aren\u2019t in the headlines, not the crisis, but perhaps the kind of humble building blocks for seeing a different picture and perhaps seeing a different future. And you have been involved or were involved in this Open House initiative. Are you still doing that? Yeah, very much so. And the miracle of Open House is that we\u2019ve been able to prove that dialogue can happen not only among university-educated, middle-class people, but it could also happen in a\u2026 That poverty doesn\u2019t have to be a stumbling block or\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026a complete hindrance\u2026 That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And it could happen in a really hard place. The story of Open House is extraordinary. It was founded by a friend of mine, Dalia Landau, who grew up in Ramle. Her parents were refugees from post-Holocaust Europe. Ramle was one of the areas from which Arabs were expelled by Israel in the 1948 war, and Dalia growing up knew nothing about this. And one day after the 1967 war, an Arab family knocks on the door. They had come from Ramallah and now the border was open between Israel and the West Bank after the \u201967 war. Right. And they said we used to live here and could we see the house? This made an enormous impression on Dalia, especially the blind grandfather, who wanted to touch the lemon tree that he remembered grew in the courtyard and was still there. And Dalia later moved out, her parents died. She was an only child. She inherited this house and she decided to donate it to reconciliation work for the future of Ramle\u2019s Arab and Jewish children and she, in fact, did this in conjunction with the family that had originally lived in this house\u2026 That knocked on her door. That knocked on her door. So Open House is really a symbol for possibility. And, yes, it\u2019s true that this, again \u2014 and I can\u2019t emphasis this enough \u2014 this is happening within an Israeli context. We\u2019re dealing with Arab citizens of Israel\u2026 Yeah. I hear you talking a lot about what\u2019s happening between Arab and Jewish Israelis. Because I don\u2019t see at this point a real possibility, at this point, of overcoming the literal wall between Palestinians and Israelis. But I do very much see, not just the possibility but the imperative for the Jewish majority in Israel to reach out to the Arab minority and say we welcome you into Israeli society, you are part of us. We want you as equal citizens and that could possibly, possibly, if when I think of hope in the long term, that could possibly be a long-term bridge to the Middle East. But again, we\u2019re talking about a very long-term process. Israeli journalist and author Yossi Klein Halevi. In his 2001 book, At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden, he wrote, \u201CIf peace is ever to come to the Middle East, religion must be an integral part of the process. The Oslo Accords tried to impose a peace of secular elites on a region whose language and instincts are religious. This book, then, is an attempt at helping to begin to redress that fateful omission.\u201D Despite Yossi Klein Halevi\u2019s own present sense of the limits of both religion and politics in his land, he insists that a failure to take religion seriously is at the root of a Western failure to comprehend the Israeli-Palestinian present. One of the frustrations that I feel in these last years, both with Israel at war and the U.S. at war, is the polarization between a left wing that doesn\u2019t want to look at the political reality and prefers to hide behind wishful thinking, on the one hand, and a right wing that tends to indulge in anti-Islamic racism, hatred, contempt for Islam and that truly hates Islam. And I can\u2019t feel comfortable in either camp. I feel schizophrenic in a certain way. I end up defending Islam against the right and defending the war on terror against the left. You know, and when Europe, Western Europe in particular, represents for me exactly the wrong approach, both politically and spiritually. And if you take this cartoon incident, I think it\u2019s telling that those cartoons, which really were a deliberate assault on Muslim religious sensibilities, those cartoons didn\u2019t come out of the American press. They also didn\u2019t come out of the Israeli press. You don\u2019t see that kind of contempt for Islam in the mainstream Israeli media despite five years of Jihadist terrorism. And I think that that\u2019s telling because what you have in Europe is, on the one hand, a policy of appeasement toward terror and, on the other, a contempt for Islam. And I think that those two distorted policies are expressions of the same basic approach, which is not to treat the Muslim world seriously. Isn\u2019t that also an expression of what you have said that, you know, wanting to dismiss or belittle religion in this picture, you know, to assert that it really shouldn\u2019t matter that much. Exactly. So I can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I\u2019ve had in recent weeks with European journalists. I just had a conversation this afternoon with a journalist from Finland, who , on the one hand, talking to me about the hysteria in Israel about Hamas. And on the other hand, talking about the cartoons in Denmark as, \u2018Oh, just something silly and not serious.\u2019 I take those cartoons very seriously as an offense against a fellow religion and I take the rise of Hamas very seriously as a tremendous distortion of religion and as a threat to my existence\u2026 Right. And that\u2019s because I take religion seriously, and it\u2019s part of the same approach of respect. I will respect Islam as a partner and I will respect Hamas as an enemy and that\u2019s my plea for clarity, if we have political clarity. It\u2019s \u2014 what you\u2019re asking people to do also in the United States is to start seeing the world differently, right? I mean, you\u2019re talking about throwing out categories that people use without thinking to analyze. Yes. Both left and right. Right. Very much so. Right. You\u2019re mixing up the picture. You\u2019re mixing up the way people look at these things all together. Exactly, exactly. And what we need now \u2014 and this is something that really should come from religious people, from religious pluralists \u2014 what we need is a nuanced way of approaching our relationship with Islam. When there are problems, face the problems. Sometimes one requires a hard line in dealing with these problems, but at the same time, never lose your basic respect for Islam as a religion that has brought countless souls to the presence of God and that has taught its believers humility and discipline and love of God and, at its best, love of humanity. That\u2019s there in Islam and I know it\u2019s there. I experienced it. I experienced the \u201Cfearless heart of Islam\u201D that you had quoted earlier. And you also fear that heart everyday. Yes, yes. That\u2019s right\u2026 You fear the dark\u2026 \u2026and at the same time. \u2026expression of that. At the same time, I\u2019m ready to face the darkness that large parts of Islam \u2014 I\u2019m not going to euphemisms here \u2014 large parts of Islam have declared the Jewish people the enemy and have declared war against the existence of the Jewish people and have gone on a campaign of dehumanizing the Jewish people in a way that those cartoons that appeared in the Danish newspaper were just a small taste of what we see here in the Middle East almost every day in government newspapers, the most demeaning, insulting portrayal of Jews and Judaism. The kinds of anti-Semitic cartoons that we haven\u2019t seen since the Nazi era that are routine in Arab government media. And that is part of what I face. So yes, when I speak to Muslims \u2014 as I have in recent weeks \u2014 about the cartoons, my response is very straightforward. I\u2019m with you in affirming the dignity of Islam as a great religion, but I\u2019m going to ask you to look at the kind of cartoons that your people throughout the Middle East see on a daily basis. And I\u2019m going to ask what your response to that is. And there\u2019s real depth and integrity in both of those reactions you have in holding both of those ideas together. It is, I would say, if I had to define what my real spiritual struggle is living in Jerusalem in these last five years, it\u2019s holding onto both those sensibilities and very often losing the balance, then being forced to remind myself that I also have a religious commitment not only to protect Israel and stand strong against what I see as an attack on my very being, but also to remember the dignity of Palestinians, the dignity of Islam and to remind myself of the love that I felt, not just the respect that I felt for Islam in the Mosque when I got on my knees and joined the Muslim prayer line, but really the tremendous sense of gratitude to Islam for making the experience of prayer and surrender to God so overwhelming. There\u2019s just nothing quite like Muslim prayer. And when you\u2019re part of that prayer line \u2014 and you know that choreography of prayer when you get on your knees and you stand and you bend and you stand again and you prostrate and that repeated \u2014 the effect is of a kind of a wave of prayer. And you feel yourself to be this point, this particle in this great wave of prayer and you just join this extraordinary wave that\u2019s just always there and always will be there. That\u2019s a gift that I received from Islam. And that\u2019s something that I have to remind myself even when I\u2019m being politically realistic and hard. Israeli Journalist Yossi Klein Halevi. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Given all the experiences we\u2019ve been discussing, including Yossi Klein Halevi\u2019s early years as a Jewish extremist, I wondered how he responds to crises with a religious dimension elsewhere in the world. Shortly before we spoke, a new spiral of religiously charged violence erupted in Iraq after a major Shiite shrine in Samarra was bombed. I grew up indulging my anger in a Holocaust survivor family, enraged at the whole world. I saw the Holocaust as being the responsibility not just of the murderers, but of the onlookers. Everyone or almost everyone, for me, was implicated in the Holocaust. And I saw my rage as being the most noble part of me. That was the part of me that was purest; that was the most spiritual. I wouldn\u2019t have used that language then. But that\u2019s really what I felt. And I was soaring, I was soaring with righteousness and nobility when my anger was distilled to its purest and its rage. And my spiritual struggle growing out of that was to realize that sometimes the qualities that we think of as our best, our most spiritual qualities are actually our most self-destructive, are exactly the qualities we need to overcome. We need to surrender in order to move on and become real servants of God. And that took me years and years to learn. I was just sitting with a friend yesterday and he reminded me of something that I\u2019d very conveniently forgotten, which was when I\u2019d first come to Israel in 1982, him and I went on a trip together and we went to a Jewish holy site here in Israel. And there were two German tourists in that holy site. And I went over to them and they were speaking German. And I shouted to them and said, \u201CDon\u2019t speak that language in this holy place, don\u2019t desecrate this holy place.\u201D And I don\u2019t remember the incident, fortunately; I\u2019ve protected myself from the memory. But I, you know, it\u2019s true to form. I look back at myself in those years and, yeah, that\u2019s probably what I did. So you see yourself, actually, when you see these people enraged and you see the rage out of control? Yeah, I was looking at some of the pictures after the destruction of the mosque and what I saw in some of the faces was very familiar to me. It wasn\u2019t just rage in the sense of despair. It was the opposite: it was the ecstasy of rage. And that is what I, when I look at those crowds, that\u2019s where I so uncomfortably identify myself and\u2026 So what do you do with that\u2026 \u2026place myself. \u2026fact that you can actually understand, in a way? You know, that\u2019s really the question for me because now that rage is directed against me, it\u2019s directed against my children. And, obviously, my first response is I have to do everything I can to push that rage as far away as possible. And if it means building a wall, it means building a wall. But at some point, I\u2019m going to have to engage that rage. And it\u2019s still a little bit raw for me. I don\u2019t have an answer, but maybe, at some point, that\u2019s the work I need to start thinking about. And that\u2019s very terrifying because I know what that rage is. And I know that if someone had tried to reach me when I was a teenager caught up in the purity of my Holocaust rage, I don\u2019t think it would have been possible.
