  "fullText": "I had just read Lily King\u2019s fun novel about the early love affair between the great anthropologists, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, when I began to rediscover the wise and original writings of their daughter. Mary Catherine Bateson is a linguist and anthropologist herself. She explores life as an improvisational art at every age. Composing a Life is the title of one of her books that has touched many. She\u2019s composed a life that is far more settled, but always in dialogue with the memory of her brilliant, globe-trotting, unconventionally-coupled parents. You cite your mother saying this very insightful thing \u2014 that too many people, when they reject God, go on believing in the devil, that many intellectuals have a sense of evil without a confidence in good. : She did indeed say that, and she said it about some specific people. I think \u2014 I\u2019m not happy with the division between people who say, \u201CI\u2019m spiritual, but not religious.\u201D To me, the starting place is the sense of wonder. And that can take you into science. It can take you into art. Other human beings are amazing and beautiful. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Mary Catherine Bateson is Professor Emerita at George Mason University. Her books include With a Daughter\u2019s Eye, Composing a Life, and Composing a Further Life: The Age of Active Wisdom. She grew up in multi-family households in New York City and beyond. She now lives in New Hampshire with her husband in the same house they bought together as graduate students in 1963. I spoke with her in 2015. You know, I\u2019ve read you across the years. I read Composing a Life, and I read With a Daughter\u2019s Eye years and years ago and then have been really intrigued by what you\u2019ve been writing more recently \u2014 so just by way of saying, I\u2019m really delighted to be speaking with you. And it\u2019s so interesting just to look at the beginnings of your life. I mean it seems like, in some ways, your childhood was this vast anthropological experiment, beginning with breast-feeding \u2014 which most people just can\u2019t say about their infancy. Well, it was a great advantage. I mean after all, I had the benefit of ideas that are now regarded as the better form of child raising. When I was born, middle-class women didn\u2019t nurse babies. That would have been an animal-like thing to do. Only the very poor actually breastfed. So I was very lucky that my mother, having been in Bali and New Guinea, believed that breastfeeding was good for babies and for mothers. And sometimes you\u2019re called Dr. Spock\u2019s first baby. It seems to me, in reading about that, that your mother was educating Dr. Spock as much as he was advising her. Absolutely. He was young, fashionable, and being psychoanalyzed. And she figured \u2014 we\u2019re talking 1939 \u2014 that if he was being psychoanalyzed, he must be pretty progressive, open-minded. So if I ask you to describe the spiritual background of your childhood, whatever connotations you bring to that language of spirituality, how would you start to talk about that? Well, I would start with the fact that the day I was born, my mother received a telegram from her husband, who had sailed to the U.K. to enlist, the war having begun in Europe and not yet \u2014 the United States wasn\u2019t yet involved. And he sent off a cable saying, \u201CCongratulations on Baby Catherine. Do not christen.\u201D Right. It\u2019s very interesting \u2014 I mean it comes through in your writing, but even more in talking to you \u2014 you have such an intimate identification with your parents. But also, there\u2019s a distance \u2014 like you even talk about yourself in the third person sometimes, as a baby, which was something about how the life that you were born into was about living and reflecting, all at the same time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried to track down my first lesson in participant observation, actually, and written about that, because \u2014 I mean that\u2019s what anthropologists do. They live with the people of the culture they\u2019re studying. They eat with them. They hang out with them, ask them questions, all of those things. So they\u2019re participants, but they\u2019re also observing, and they\u2019re also self-observing. So one day, when I was probably about eight or nine, she took me in a cab. She said we were going to visit a family who had a little boy named Bobby, and the parents were worried about him, and he wasn\u2019t behaving well in school. Now Bobby was an awful pain in the neck. I mean he hit me, and he pinched me, and he ignored me, and he wouldn\u2019t share his toys. There was definitely a problem there. So after a couple of hours, she fetched me from the playroom, and we went out and got a cab to head for home, and she said, \u201CNow tell me about Bobby.\u201D And I said \u2014 where I had learned this, I don\u2019t know \u2014 I said, \u201CI\u2019m going to wait till we get home, and I will dictate to you what I think about Bobby, so that if another child ever has to play with a child like that, they\u2019ll have a resource. They\u2019ll have a way of knowing about it.\u201D So even your play dates were anthropological experiments, with you as the anthropologist. They often were, yeah. But actually \u2014 I mean I think there\u2019s a huge benefit in being a participant-observer. There are people who are just observers and don\u2019t engage with others. There are people that just engage and don\u2019t think about what\u2019s happening. And to learn to go back and forth between \u2014 or simultaneously be learning, observing, but at the same time be fully present \u2014 was a marvelous thing to learn. And it\u2019s a marvelous way to live, actually. Well, it\u2019s certainly a ripe field for the work of becoming wise. And I think your book, Composing a Life \u2014 I mean that is a phrase that you brought into the world that\u2019s very evocative and rich, and I think it actually follows on what we\u2019ve just been talking about, this discipline and way of being that you imbibed, growing up, of living and reflecting. So just talk a little bit about that notion of composing a life and how that came to you and what you mean by that. Well, at that point I had been Dean of Faculty at Amherst College for several years, with a faculty that hadn\u2019t gotten used to the idea of coeducation yet and was habitually antagonistic to the administration, which is not uncommon. And I was very aware, at that point in history, that women were going back to school, back into the workplace, trying for the first time to combine family life with an active career \u2014 and finding it very difficult, talking about juggling, which to me is a terribly anxiety-producing metaphor. Right. It\u2019s a very \u2014 I mean you say that in your writing, and I wrote that down, because it does throw into sharp relief what a different way of approaching \u201Ccomposing\u201D a life is, rather than \u201Cjuggling.\u201D But people would say to me, \u201CYou know, I can\u2019t get my life together. I try different things. My husband says I\u2019m not a serious person, because I don\u2019t have a consistent career line. I feel like such a failure.\u201D And what I saw was that they were working harder than their husbands and doing a pretty good job. And I was looking for a metaphor that would allow them to realize that the effort they were making to work out a new kind of woman\u2019s role was creative, that it was an art form. You say, \u201CLife as an improvisation, as an improvisatory art.\u201D Exactly. Well, you know, people think improvisation means you don\u2019t practice. But I have a cousin who is a jazz flutist, and I know that jazz musicians practice improvisation by the hour. And improvisation is a high order of skill. You say, in Composing a Life \u2014 so again, this was some decades ago. This was in the latter part of the 20th century, and now we\u2019re in the early decades of the 21st. You said, \u201CIn a stable society, composing a life is somewhat like throwing a pot or building a house in a traditional form: the materials are known, the hands move along familiar tasks, the fit of the completed whole in common life is understood.\u201D But what you just said about the situation of women in those latter decades of the 20th century is true of everybody \u2014 just about everybody graduating from college now \u2014 that, as you said, the consistent career paths aren\u2019t there for anyone, in that sense. I think that\u2019s the case. I mean I think we now live with constant change. And so they\u2019re onstage without a script. Yes, and which again, I think, just playing with this language and kind of delving into this language of composing and \u2014 here\u2019s another piece of your writing: \u201CI like to think of men and women as artists of their own lives, working with what comes to hand through accident or talent to compose and recompose a pattern in time that expresses who they are and what they believe in, making meaning even as they are studying and working and raising children, creating and recreating themselves.\u201D You know, that metaphor was simply a gift. A bad metaphor can create chaos, literally. In Composing a Further Life, about later adulthood, I talk about what I call \u201Cactive wisdom,\u201D the concept of active wisdom, of having a period before becoming frail and multiple medical problems and so on and so forth, when you have the harvest of a life of learning and thinking and observing, and at the same time, you\u2019re still active. I have to tell you, it\u2019s wisdom on the hoof. I like that. You say there\u2019s \u2014 you talk about \u201CAdulthood I,\u201D the first phase of adulthood, which is what we traditionally have thought of as adulthood. But then, with these suddenly ever-longer productive lives, you talk about \u201CAdulthood II\u201D as a new developmental stage, which I like: \u201Cwisdom on the hoof.\u201D [laughs] I think it is. I think it is so profound a change, it really affects our status as a species. It\u2019s something that gives me hope that we will deal with climate change. We will learn to be more careful with the ways we use the planet, because what\u2019s been happening is, we\u2019ve been living longer and thinking shorter. We\u2019ve been accelerating our activities. And gosh, if we have more people that have lived into a certain degree of wisdom, maybe we\u2019ll think twice. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the wise writer Mary Catherine Bateson. She\u2019s an anthropologist and linguist and the daughter of the iconic 20th century anthropologists, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson. As you yourself have composed your life \u2014 I mean you composed your life. You did become a linguist and an anthropologist, which \u2014 I mean the field which your mother, in fact both of your parents really helped create, has radically evolved \u2014 but you are part of that field. But one thing you said about your mother, as your mother composed her life, she made her marriage and her family fit into that. And you\u2019ve done it very differently. Can I just ask you this? There\u2019s this quote of your mother, of Margaret Mead, that I\u2019ve discussed with other people, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, so I can ask you now. Did she say \u2014 so both of your parents had three marriages, is that right? Each of them was married three times. Each of them was married three times. And I\u2019ve heard that your mother said that everyone has three marriages, even if it\u2019s to the same person. Is that true? I haven\u2019t ever heard it quoted in exactly that way. I think that adding \u201Ceven if it\u2019s to the same person\u201D does make sense. I mean marriage \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard this statistic, but the average duration of a marriage in the United States today is longer than it was in colonial times. Yeah, because people didn\u2019t live as long, and women died in childbirth? Exactly. Divorce could be called a replacement for death. I mean that\u2019s a cynical way of putting it, but the point is, we think of marriage as a relationship between two mature people, hopefully, who love each other and settle in to constancy and continuity. And in fact, those two people are growing and changing all the time. I mean just as you have to keep learning your infant from week to week, because the infant is growing and discovering things, marriage requires a constant rhythm of adaptation between two people who are changing. And much as we would like the constancy, it\u2019s actually quite a challenge. But I think \u2014 I mean it\u2019s funny. One of the things that I tend to talk about a great deal is the amount of learning that takes place throughout adulthood. You don\u2019t graduate from college, and the president of your college says, \u201CStand up. You are now\u2026\u201D The president of Harvard used to say, \u201CYou now join the company of educated men.\u201D Right. Well, far as I can see, they\u2019re out of kindergarten, and they\u2019ve got a huge amount to learn. There\u2019s such a contrast between this truth you\u2019re telling \u2014 because it is truth. It\u2019s really common sense. I mean you\u2019re just \u2014 you\u2019re talking about the reality we all know. And yet, it stands in such contrast to the focus, the ambition and focus that we press on ourselves and on our children \u2014 and on children, it seems, at younger and younger ages. Alas, one of the things we press on them is competition, because we have so much bought into the idea that competition is a law of nature and the only source of creativity. And incidentally, that is not a true biological fact. There is competition as part of the evolutionary process, but there is a tremendous amount of cooperation also involved, even at the cellular level. But even evolutionary biology is \u2014 these days, is paying so much attention to cooperation. And there\u2019s this much broader palette of science that describes us in so many other ways that you\u2019re a part of, too. Co-evolution, endosymbiosis. What\u2019s that? Well, when you were in high school, you looked through a microscope at a cell, and one of the things you learned to recognize was the nucleus of the cell, right? You made pictures of it. Well, the earliest life forms had no nucleus, and on the whole, bacteria don\u2019t have that kind of nucleus. And a biologist named Lynn Margulis, who was a microbiologist studying single-celled creatures and their progenitors, came up with the theory that the cell with a nucleus actually came about by one single-cell organism taking up residence inside the other in a way that was mutually beneficial. The cells in the green plants have little islands of chlorophyll in order to do photosynthesis that is the base of our entire food chain, right? And it is now understood that they were originally like algae \u2014 they took up residence inside these cells, because they needed a home that they didn\u2019t have. And so for millions of years, every cell in every leaf is actually a cooperative enterprise. And one thing that\u2019s so interesting in the vision of life that you\u2019ve been developing is precisely that view, also, of how we compose our lives as the building blocks of that interdependence. I mean you used the word \u201Chome\u201D just a minute ago, talking about the natural world. And homemaking is something you\u2019ve been talking about. You tell this story in a few places, that when you first met your future husband that you were telling him about your life and your parents\u2019 failed marriages and your sense that with these role models, you could never sustain a commitment, and that somehow, that very evening, it ended with the two of you talking about when you would get married. That\u2019s right. Indeed we did. Talk to me about what the word \u201Chomemaking\u201D holds for you. Well, creating an environment in which learning is possible. And that is what a home is. I mean that is what we want the homes that we give to our children to be \u2014 places where they grow in many, many different ways. They learn how to connect with other people. They learn how to care for others. They learn particular skills. They learn their own capacities and how to trust other people and how to trust themselves. They learn what respect is. I\u2019m very interested in the question of how social change happens, how human change happens. Somewhere, you talk about your mother\u2019s enduring question was, \u201CWhat kind of world can we build for our children?\u201D And it seems to me that you are seeing the metaphor of homemaking as a version or a variation on that question that is potentially as profound, or perhaps more what is appropriate to this profoundly interconnected world that we inhabit now. One of the things that biologists have said about human beings is that we retain many of our infant characteristics throughout our lives. You\u2019ve heard stories about the people that wanted to raise a lion in their home, people that have wanted to raise a chimp in their home; other stories of trying to tame a wild animal, and when it matures, it loses its flexibility, and the relationship breaks down. And there are typical physical changes that go with maturity, in many species, that are more dramatic than in human beings \u2014 get a lot more hair, for instance \u2014 and in a sense, human beings remain childlike. They\u2019re open to new learning and even very deep learning that changes your personality, really. Right through the life cycle, human beings remain playful \u2014 and play is a very important part of learning \u2014 and experimental. Most other species, they figure out how to be a rabbit or a chicken or an owl or a fish, and that\u2019s what they do for the rest of their life; so learning is us. What was your mother\u2019s notion of \u201Cevolutionary clusters\u201D? What was that about? Well, you\u2019ve probably seen the slogan that gets quoted all the time \u2014 \u201CNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.\u201D That\u2019s a Margaret Mead quote. Yeah. We\u2019ve never been able to find it in its first iteration in print. But that\u2019s a definition of evolutionary clusters? Yes, and that very often major accelerations of change came out when a group of people got together and learned together and dared to think new thoughts and then pass them on. And that\u2019s true of the disciples of Jesus, a small group that \u2014 pow! \u2014 spread out, spreading ideas that they\u2019d learned. It was true of the American Revolution \u2014 a group of thoughtful colonists thinking, actually, about French philosophy, mainly, and deciding they wanted to be independent. And the point is that the evolutionary part of that was in the relationships between the members of those small groups, feeding off of each other\u2019s imaginations and insights and wisdom and then spreading them out in the society, going forward. You can listen again and share this conversation with Mary Catherine Bateson through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the linguist, anthropologist, and wise woman, Mary Catherine Bateson. She explores the matter of composing our lives, of life as an improvisational art at every age. Since her childhood as the daughter of the towering anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, she\u2019s had an ability to experience life both as an original observer and as a joyful participant. I do find echoes, but also, I find that you are improvising or working with some of the same convictions, but bringing them into a different world. I mean here\u2019s something you wrote about your belief that \u201Cmultiple small spheres of personal experience both echo and enable events shared more widely, expressions of moment in a world in which we now recognize that no microcosm is completely separate, no tide pool, no forest, no family, no nation. Indeed, the knowledge drawn from the life of some single organism or community or from the intimate experience of an individual may prove to be relevant to decisions that affect the health of a city or the peace of the world.\u201D That\u2019s very emboldening. That\u2019s a very central quotation. Now I\u2019m working on a book, the title of which is Love Across Difference. And central to the thinking in that book is that love depends on a recognition of something in common and the valuing of a difference. Right. You don\u2019t want someone just like yourself. You want someone enough like yourself so that you can learn new things from them. I\u2019d like to talk to you about religion. I mean it\u2019s very interesting. Your parents had, as we\u2019ve discussed, complicated lives and philosophies and complicated relationships with religion \u2014 I mean you describe your father\u2019s studied English atheism \u2014 but across his lifespan, he was investigating conscious purpose, and the San Francisco Zen Center was an important place for him, and the Esalen Institute, and you read him passages that he loved from the Book of Job while he was dying. And your mother, you quote this \u2014 these lines of Kipling that I was just so taken with, Kipling\u2019s description of heaven, which your mother loved: Heaven as a place of tireless creativity, \u201Cbut each for the joy of working, and each, in his separate star.\u201D \u201CHis separate star,\u201D will paint \u201Cthe Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They are!\u201D Isn\u2019t that a wonderful line \u2014 \u201CThe God of Things as They are\u201D? It is wonderful. I love it. And it seems to me that across your life, you were more overtly curious and moving towards religion and wanting to understand it and what its place in your life might be. I mean I\u2019m curious about \u2014 both as a human being and as an anthropologist, how you\u2019ve come to think of the presence of these traditions among us, what they mean for human beings and their integrity in this moment of change, because that way your father was is really the way many, many people are growing up to be now. I mean he was quite unique. Well, his father, who was a distinguished biologist, insisted they read the Bible to each other on a fairly regular basis, the parents and the three sons, because, his father said, he didn\u2019t want them to be empty-minded atheists. Your mother said this \u2014 you cite your mother saying this very insightful, wonderful thing \u2014 that \u201Ctoo many people, when they reject God, go on believing in the devil,\u201D that many intellectuals have a sense of evil without a confidence in good. She did indeed say that, and she said it about some specific people. I think \u2014 what shall I say? I think I\u2019m not happy with the division between people who say, \u201CI\u2019m spiritual, but not religious.\u201D To me the starting place is the sense of wonder. And that can take you into science. It can take you into art. Other human beings are amazing and beautiful. The natural world around us \u2014 the more we study it, the more fascinating and intricate and elegant it turns out to be. That\u2019s my interpretation of the Book of Job, incidentally. My father used to say that Job gets over his distress by learning some natural history. But I don\u2019t think it is a matter of \u2014 I mean God, you remember, in the Book of Job, God says, \u201CDo you know why the rains fall here and not there, when the deer bring forth their young?\u201D Et cetera, et cetera. It sounds like a quiz on nature studies. That\u2019s right, yeah. But that\u2019s not really what it is. I think the point about the Book of Job is that Job is a virtuous member of an institution. He\u2019s respectable. He obeys all the rules. He\u2019s complacent. He goes through the appropriate rituals that were required in his community at that time. But he\u2019s lost his sense of wonder. And then God says, \u201CLook. Just look. Realize how beautiful it is, how complicated it is \u2014 the wonder of Creation.\u201D And he wakes up. I actually got interested in the sense of wonder because \u2014 for a series of historical reasons, I know a lot about Judaism. I lived my last year of high school in Israel. And then I came back and decided I wanted to learn about Islam, and so I studied Arabic. And then you spent a good amount of time in Iran, before the Revolution. You had made a home there. About seven years \u2014 well, six years, say. So I thought I should be doing something to address the Islamophobia, the hostility, the prejudice that has grown up in this country after 9/11. The way I went about it was to say, \u201CWhat is it that makes me, as a Christian, empathize with a Muslim? At what point are we together?\u201D And what struck me is that what \u2014 actually, all three of the religions that come from Abraham: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam \u2014 that what we all have in common is the sense of wonder that leads to praise. That is to say, when you go from wonder to a religious context, shared worship, something like that, it takes the form of praise. And in spite of the huge differences in other aspects of the traditions \u2014 a different set of rules, expectations, behaviors, ta-dum, ta-dum, ta-dum, ta-dum, ta-dum \u2014 praise is central in all of them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the wise writer Mary Catherine Bateson. She\u2019s an anthropologist and linguist and the daughter of the iconic 20th century anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson. So do you feel like, even as an anthropologist, that that sense of wonder is as much what religion keeps alive for human beings as ritual? Yes. I think ritual is an important part of it, because ritual is constantly building. You repeat the same thing at different stages of your life, and you\u2019re putting new layers of meaning. You\u2019re re-recognizing the familiar. You wrote a beautiful, beautiful essay about your father\u2019s death in 1980. There\u2019s a lot of drinking sherry and eating Stilton cheese, which he loved, which feels to me like the bread and wine. I mean \u2014 right? It has that same centrality. And you talked about the various things you sent with him into the fire \u2014 a volume of Blake\u2019s poetry and flowers and a crab because, you said, \u201Cin memory of the way he had taught each of us to study tide pools and the way he had taken a crab with him year after year to his opening classes at the San Francisco Art Institute to open his students\u2019 eyes to the fearful symmetries of organic life.\u201D And then, you said, Nora, which was his \u2014 your stepsister, brought a bagel, because he \u2014 Half sister. Half sister. Half sister. Oh, half sister. Right. Eric brought the crab. Oh, okay. He\u2019s a stepbrother. Stepbrother, all right. And she brought a bagel, because your father had quipped at Esalen that the hole in a bagel would be reincarnated as a donut? Yes, I had forgotten that. But there\u2019s this \u2014 there\u2019s something you wrote that \u2014 again, I just want to say, your writing is so beautiful, and so I\u2019m doing a lot of bringing it into this conversation, but I feel like it has its rightful place. You wrote \u2014 and this is, to me, it gets at ritual as something that is also of \u2014 that even the rituals of our personal lives have more than just personal meaning. You wrote, \u201CWe talk in this country often about property rights. We talk more rarely about the shares people have in each other\u2019s lives, and about people\u2019s rights to participation and pleasure, especially at the moments of passage: the right to throw a handful of earth on a coffin, the right to stand up to catch a tossed bouquet, and dream of one\u2019s own future wedding, to kiss the bride or groom, or hold a newborn. Couples today devise new rituals or set up housekeeping together in ways most meaningful to themselves without wondering whether meaning is something they owe to a larger community.\u201D Seems like such an important question, statement, to me. Well, it\u2019s interesting. One of the things that I\u2019ve done for the last few years is, I\u2019m a lector. I\u2019m a reader in my church. And of course, the readings recycle. And one of the things that has fascinated me about \u2014 first, I just thought, \u201CThis is a business of \u2018I\u2019m going to read well and loud enough and slow enough and do a good job.'\u201D But what I\u2019ve found over time is, first of all, that the readings have a different meaning when they\u2019re read from the lectern during Mass, when they\u2019re read in the context of a community. I\u2019ve practiced, so I don\u2019t stumble. I\u2019ve been over them. I\u2019ve thought about them. So you mean it\u2019s different even when you practice by yourself, and then when you stand before the community and read it aloud. Ms. Bateson: It\u2019s one thing that I practice by myself, but when I stand before the community, and I look at these people \u2014 and that\u2019s the other thing \u2014 my relationship with the people has changed, which I didn\u2019t expect. I didn\u2019t know that would happen. And how do you explain that? What is that about? The community comes together, and here are these words that have been read and re-read and re-read and reinterpreted for 2,000 years. When you think about how many people on a given Sunday are trying to find something fresh to say about something that\u2019s been read and preached on in hundreds of churches for\u2026 Thousands of years. Thousands of years \u2014 I mean it boggles the mind. But they do, because you are always meeting the ritual a little bit different from the way you were last week or yesterday or whenever, confronting different things in your life. There\u2019s a resonance between the tradition and the present that makes it fresh. I don\u2019t know how better to put it. Let me ask you this \u2014 this large question, \u201CWhat does it mean to be human?\u201D \u2014 which is a philosophical question. It\u2019s a theological question, and it\u2019s an anthropological question. It\u2019s a question your mother, Margaret Mead, and your father, Gregory Bateson, were asking. I know it\u2019s also a huge question. How would you start to talk about how your sense of that has evolved in the course of this life you\u2019ve lived, perhaps in ways that have taken you by surprise, or not? I was going to give you an excessively intellectual answer about \u2014 having to do with consciousness, and you made it a much more personal question. Consciousness is important. Reflection is important \u2014 thinking about what you\u2019re doing and what it means and the search for meaning. One of the things that I came to believe, when I wrote that piece you referred to about my father\u2019s death, is that death is a very important part of life that we shouldn\u2019t deny, that in spite of our terrible hubris and greed and competitiveness, that we can learn to see ourselves in proportion and realize that we\u2019re small and temporary and don\u2019t understand as much as we need to. And we live in a time of real urgency, where we have to mine the insights of the past. I guess one way of saying it is, we have to learn to use the word \u201Cwe\u201D to include all of life on earth. We have to learn to experience that as a terrible and tender beauty and shape everything we do to protect it. You\u2019ve said of your parents that they were artists as much as scientists, that their knowledge was based in carrying their books, even their scientific books, in different ways full of poetry. And I also experience that in your writing and also in this conversation with you. So I want to thank you so much for just being in the world and sharing as you do. Well, thank you for giving me an opportunity to share with my New Hampshire neighbors and beyond. Mary Catherine Bateson is Professor Emerita at George Mason University.
