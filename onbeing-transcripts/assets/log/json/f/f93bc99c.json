  "fullText": "I remember there was an article about Borges in the New Yorkermaybe 20, 25 years ago. And the last line he said, \u201Cthe soul is contained in the human voice.\u201D And I was like, that\u2019s it. . And I\u2019ve been saying it ever since. This hour I get to have a conversation about the art of listening and the impact of stories with one of my media comrades and heroes, David Isay. You may have heard snippets from StoryCorps, the project he founded, on NPR. But radio pieces are just the tip of the iceberg. As Dave sees it, the StoryCorps booth \u2014 settings where two people ask the questions they\u2019ve always wanted to ask each other \u2014 these are sacred spaces. Listening, he\u2019s learned, is an act of love. And eliciting and capturing our stories is a way of insisting that every life matters. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. David Isay is the creator and president of StoryCorps. He\u2019s also won a MacArthur Genius Grant and, more recently, the TED Prize. StoryCorps has collected over 60,000 stories from across the country, with an archive at the Library of Congress. I spoke with him in 2014. I just want to say how happy I am that you\u2019re doing this, and I understand that you\u2019re having to step outside your comfort zone. So I just want you to think of this like we\u2019re in a StoryCorps booth, and it\u2019s just a little bit longer than 40 minutes. Right. I\u2019m very happy to do this. OK. I was thinking \u2026 I really feel so grateful to the show, because in so many ways, your show gave me the language to articulate StoryCorps. Oh, gosh. So I feel like if you took everything I\u2019ve ever listened to and put it in one pile, and your show, I\u2019ve gotten a thousand times more wisdom and insight from your show than everything else combined. So, I\u2019m very, very, very grateful. Well, thank you. I feel like we have kindred listening spaces, sacred spaces, the way\u2026 We sure do. \u2026you sometimes talk about what happens. So this is exciting. And I really do also \u2014 I\u2019ve been looking forward to this as \u2014 I do a conversation and not just an interview, and so just to have this chance to talk to you about listening \u2026 Sure. So let\u2019s just plunge in. I think you probably know this, that I always open with asking about the religious or spiritual background \u2014 was there a religious or spiritual background to your childhood? And I actually don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading as much as I could about you and interviews you\u2019ve given, but I haven\u2019t actually seen any reference to that, I don\u2019t think. Yeah, I went to Hebrew school when I was a kid. And I didn\u2019t connect at all. I think I\u2019m culturally Jewish \u2014 and I went to a Friends school for high school \u2014 and maybe a little more spiritually Quaker. That\u2019s interesting that you went to a Friends school, because that is a spiritual tradition of listening, really. That makes sense. And I think, when I was there, I didn\u2019t appreciate silent meeting as all. I think most teenagers roll their eyes. But as I got older, I ended up, when I got married, going back with my wife and finding it very useful, and it\u2019s just my speed and my style. Yeah. And then, you definitely belong to a lineage of listeners of different kinds, right? Your father was a psychiatrist, your grandmother was an advice columnist, your mother, very much in this \u2026 Yes, she was. You did do your homework. I did. It seems like, again, whether you were very aware of that or not, you were soaking that up, I think, as a child. Yeah, and I also think \u2014 I was not a particularly happy kid, and I always felt a little bit uncomfortable around kids my age, and liked to spend time with older people and listen to them. And that was just my thing. A little bit weird, but there you go. There\u2019s that story you\u2019ve told that when you were 12 after a Thanksgiving meal, you interviewed your grandmother and her sisters. Yes. I did. We had a tape recorder around the house, because my dad was a psychiatrist. And I guess he taped some sessions. I don\u2019t know. There was \u2014 for some reason, he had a tape recorder. This was ancient history. And it was Thanksgiving, and my grandparents were there. And I asked them to do interviews. I had a grandmother, as you said, who was an advice columnist at the New York Post for 50 years, and she had these sisters. They were all huge characters. I had an Aunt Bertie who was a complete nut. She insisted that she had invented fruit salad. And, well, she was just \u2014 I can\u2019t even go into some of the other stuff. It\u2019s not appropriate for radio. But she \u2014 they were these wild characters, one more so than the next. And I brought them in to do a interview with them this Thanksgiving, and I didn\u2019t know what I was I doing, and I was probably giggling during the interview and whatever. But I had their voices on tape. And then in successive years, when I was 13, 14, 15, that whole generation began to die off. And when I was in my 20s, I went looking for that tape and couldn\u2019t find it. And I still look for that tape. My father\u2019s passed away, but his husband tells me to please stop bothering him about it. And my mom also is not happy with me asking about the tape. And that\u2019s partly \u2014 with StoryCorps, every interview that we do goes to the Library of Congress, which means it\u2019s as safe as it can possibly be. So your great-great-great-great-great-grandkids will get to listen to this interview. So that\u2019s partly in response to the dumb move of me losing this tape, because it\u2019s the only record of these folks\u2019 voices. Yeah, and I think \u2014 I have those \u2014 there are those cassettes in my life, too, that have gone missing, that you remember. Yep. But this is an important one. My grandparents loomed very large. And I think you probably feel the same way. To me, the soul is contained in the voice. So there\u2019s just something very powerful about having that record of someone. Yeah. But that idea that the soul is contained in the voice, do you have any recollection of when you started to think about it that way? Yeah, I think \u2014 I tend to just write down stuff that other people say. I\u2019m a very linear thinker. And I guess I\u2019m a good collector of other people\u2019s deep thoughts. But I remember there was an article about Borges in the New Yorker maybe 20, 25 years ago. And in the last line he said \u201Cthe soul is contained in the human voice.\u201D And I was like, that\u2019s it. . And I\u2019ve been saying it ever since. I have to say I agree with you, and it\u2019s a mysterious thing. It\u2019s actually hard to break down any more than that, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just an experience you have. It is. I was talking about my dad a little while ago, and I lost him very suddenly. And I had done a StoryCorps interview with him, but hadn\u2019t really given it much thought. And he got diagnosed with cancer. He was perfectly healthy, working full time as a psychiatrist, and got sick, and he was dead nine or ten days later. And that night I listened to my StoryCorps interview with him for the first time, and I remember doing it and not thinking that there was anything particularly special about it. But then you listen to it and this is \u2014 it\u2019s him. And it\u2019s your only way that my \u2014 I have two young kids. It\u2019s the only way that they\u2019re going to get to know my dad. There was actually \u2014 it was interesting, because I always \u2014 I feel that this is like the vagaries of memory, and it\u2019s a side point, but my dad was a gay rights activist, and really a magnificent man. And very, very important to me. And I remember that I asked him when we were in the StoryCorps interview, \u201CWhat are you proudest of in life?\u201D And my memory of that was that he said \u201Cthe books I\u2019ve written.\u201D And I always teased him. I said, \u201CDad, we\u2019ve done, whatever, 10,000, 20,000, as time went on, 50,000 interviews, and everybody says their kids. And you, the one person, you said, \u201Cmy books.\u201D And then, the night \u2014 and I just endlessly went after him, and the night he died, I listened to the interview, and I said, \u201CWhat are you proudest of?\u201D And he said \u201CMy kids.\u201D Really? Yep. Was that exchange even in there? What you remember? You just didn\u2019t remember it? Yes, and then he said, \u201CI\u2019m also proud of my books.\u201D Interesting. But that\u2019s how memory works. You hold onto these images of people. And I guess there\u2019s something about the way these interviews, the 40-minute StoryCorps interviews are structured that it\u2019s almost \u2014 in some ways, we think of it as if you had 40 minutes left to live, what would you want to say to someone else? What would you want to learn about them? And in some ways, I think it\u2019s maybe the best way to sum up who someone is in 40 minutes, although that\u2019s a very difficult thing to do. But we have everything going for us, because it\u2019s the voice, and it\u2019s intimate, and it\u2019s honest. I think of it as the opposite of reality TV. No one comes to get rich, no one comes to get famous, it\u2019s just about generosity and love. Yeah. We\u2019ll keep talking about all of that. I do want to note that you first got into creating documentaries when you were right in your early 20s, is that right? Right at the beginning of your \u2026 Yeah, radio documentaries. Right out of college. Which, on the surface, sounds different, but then when I really look at all the things you did, I think most, if not all, of your documentaries start with you handing the cassette recorder to other people. And so the documentary, it takes this form. And your first one started with one story, one couple and a tape recorder, in 1987. Right. Do you want me to tell that? Yeah, tell that story. Sure. I was lucky to find my calling when I was a kid. And I was actually heading to medical school to be part of this long line of psychiatrists in my family. And I actually took a year off to tutor and started a job tutoring kids at my school in science stuff, which I was pretty good at. And then one day, I was walking around the East Village, where I lived, and I saw this window that caught my eye. It was a little storefront. And it was a 12-step recovery store with books and different stuff. And there was art in the window from this couple who ran it. And I started talking to them, and they were remarkable. Right. So this couple was \u2014 this was 1987, I think, maybe early \u201888. And they started talking to me, and they said that they were both former transit workers, and they both had AIDS. He had been an IV drug user. And this is when AIDS was a death sentence. That\u2019s right. And they took me to the back of the store and said, we want to show you something. And they\u2019d created this tongue-depressor model of this \u201CMuseum to Addiction.\u201D And they started unrolling these blueprints of what was going to be on every floor of this Museum of Addiction. Again, the windows, just beautifully done in such incredible detail. And they told me that they were convinced that they were going to open this museum before they died. And that they were intent on doing that. And then pulled out a book that they had, a binder book, with \u2014 they had written to Donald Trump and everybody else, asking for money. And clearly they were form rejection letters, but in those form rejection letters, they saw hope. And I was just, you know, it just was this courage of convictions, just these incredible, beautiful people. And I went home \u2014 and this was the day when they had something called Yellow Pages \u2014 and I started going through the Yellow Pages and calling all the TV stations. I\u2019d never heard of public radio. And they all said no. And then I started calling all the radio stations, and I got to the local community station here, WBAI, and the news director, whose name is Amy Goodman, who\u2019s now well-known for\u2026 Democracy Now. \u2026a radio show called Democracy Now, right. She said, that sounds like a great story, but we don\u2019t have anyone to do it. Why don\u2019t you do it? So I borrowed a tape recorder, and I went to them. And I really did have this moment where, when I sat down with the tape recorder and pushed \u2014 back then it was play and record at the same time to record something. Yeah, right. And started talking to them, I said, this \u2014 at that moment, I knew that\u2019s what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life. I was so, so lucky, at such a young age\u2026 You were going to be pushing play and record and whatever form that continued to take, yeah. Forever, yep. Until they \u2014 even in the box, when they put me away, like play and record was my destiny and my fate. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with StoryCorps founder David Isay, exploring his passion for collecting the voices of ordinary people. You did a documentary called Stonewall Remembered, which \u2014 Right. Remembering Stonewall. Remembering Stonewall, which was not autobiographical strictly, but really was tracing part of your story in a way. For sure. Part of your story and your father\u2019s story. This was the first documentary I actually ever did. And this was just months after the story I just told about the couple. Oh, I didn\u2019t realize that was the first one. Oh yeah. No, and this was \u2014 it was just about the same time that I had met the couple that I had discovered that my dad was gay. And you were \u2014 so you were in your early 20s and you hadn\u2019t known before. 21 or 22, no. No, I mean he was \u2026 And your parents were married, right? They were. And I knew that he was an activist and talked about gay rights, and I had just assumed that this was part of \u2014 he was always someone who fought for the underdogs and was very intent on making sure that everybody was treated with dignity. So I thought that was just part of that. And it really didn\u2019t occur to me that he was gay. But I did find out by accident that year. Just probably around the same month that I did that recording. And, I was \u2014 it was hard for me, because it was a really \u2014 shook everything. Yeah, it shakes the foundations of what you \u2014 of your family identity. Yeah. I\u2019m not big on secrets, and holding secrets and all that stuff, as you can probably guess from the work. So my dad mentioned to me, at some point when we were talking \u2014 he mentioned Stonewall, and I looked into it. I\u2019d never heard of it. It was the riot that happened in late June of 1969 where, at this bar, the Stonewall Inn, there was a riot. And it was the first time that gays and lesbians were mentioned in the paper. And it was just this \u2014 it was one of those \u2014 it was the Rosa Parks moment. It was just one of these seminal moments where everything comes together and focuses at this one place, and this one time. And I took my tape recorder and did this documentary, and dedicated it to my dad, and that was through that documentary I was able to find healing and open a conversation back up with my dad, which continued up until he died. So you did your documentaries for, what, maybe 10 years, and then you started StoryCorps. More than that. More than that? Yeah, 15 years. 15 years. Wow, you started so young. And then \u2014 And now I\u2019m so old. No. You\u2019re still young. And then you started StoryCorps, I believe, in 2003. Is that right? Mm-hmm. So tell me, how would you start to say what you had learned about listening that made you want to create StoryCorps? Well, I thought of, and still think of StoryCorps as the \u2014 it\u2019s the opposite of the documentary work that I used to do. And I did a lot of stories that were in places where people\u2019s voices weren\u2019t heard. And I\u2019d come to believe that the \u2014 for these folks, the act of being listened to was far more important than being in the documentary itself, and could be transformative in people\u2019s lives, because no one had actually ever listened to them. So the idea of StoryCorps was to take documentary and turn it on its head and say what this is about, and it is what it\u2019s about, and continues to be about, is giving the people the chance to have these conversations, and be listened to. And in that act of sitting with a loved one, and being asked who are you, and what have you learned in life, and how do you want to be remembered, being reminded how much their lives matter. It\u2019s a very simple idea. But one thing I knew had to happen, both for the archival piece, because of what I was talking about with the tape that I had lost \u2026 You were \u2014 those tapes would never be lost. Right. The fact that this goes to the Library of Congress tells people that their story is important enough to be part of American history. And I hear all the time, every day, from people saying that the 40 minutes they spent in one of our booths is among the most important 40 minutes of their lives, which is something I hadn\u2019t expected, but I guess I\u2019m not terribly surprised. Right. So, I don\u2019t just sense this \u2026 Have you done a StoryCorps interview, Krista? I have not. OK, well, we\u2019ve got to get you in the booth. OK, we\u2019ll do it. We will. I can\u2019t say no now, can I? So, I don\u2019t just \u2014 I was going to say I sense, but I don\u2019t just sense it, I know it. Because I\u2019m out in the world talking. People are so hungry for the knowledge of how to create these spaces, to create spaces for listening. And for even hearing their own voices. So I just want to break it apart a little bit. Sure. You\u2019ve said, when you\u2019re in the StoryCorps booth, you\u2019re in this sacred space. That\u2019s a big way to start. But, tell me what makes it sacred? Well, it\u2019s interesting, because I had a couple of theories based on the hundreds, maybe thousand interviews that I\u2019d done. And one was that you needed the sacred space to do the interview in. So we created this booth that \u2014 where the lights are low, and you well know what happens when you walk into a recording studio. There\u2019s this sucking sound when the door shuts and you\u2019re in complete silence. And so we built our booths that way, to be these very, peaceful, comfortable places. And then the other theory was that we needed \u2014 to have this experience you needed a facilitator present. And these facilitators are these people who work for StoryCorps, and they call it \u201Cbearing witness\u201D to these interviews. And a couple years into the project, we realized that we could \u2014 that the facilitators could set up equipment in any quiet room anywhere, and people would essentially have the same experience. So the actual physical space turned out not to be as important as I thought, but the presence of a facilitator, who are hired because they\u2019re great listeners, was and remains very, very important to the experience. Yeah, so I wanted to ask you about that role of the facilitator, and reason I think it\u2019s important to describe it is that, when a lot of people imagine a facilitated conversation, they imagine that person really leading the conversation, structuring it, right? Oh, that\u2019s interesting. I never thought of that. Intervening. But I think it\u2019s so, to me, it says it all when you say that they are bearing witness. And so there\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, well, they say that. That\u2019s how they describe it. \u2026a human dynamic then. In a way, Dave, even though these conversations are so intimate, like unbelievably intimate, between people who\u2019ve maybe known each other all their lives, it adds a communal dimension. Right? You\u2019re absolutely right. Many times you\u2019ll have someone and their parent in the booth, and there might be some stress in their relationship. And when they\u2019re asking a story and the parent will say, I\u2019ve told that story before. But then they turn to the facilitator. And the facilitator becomes the ears of the world. And that person in the booth realizes that, and just begins to open up and speak. So there\u2019s something about those three people in the booth that\u2019s just perfect. Yeah. So we\u2019re not going to mess with it. And 40 minutes, is there a magic about 40 minutes? Nope. I don\u2019t know. Different people have different theories about interviewing. I always found that the best material happened when people were able to focus. And when I did these interviews when I was making documentaries \u2014 I think you know this feeling. It\u2019s just this very, very intense listening. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s like a laser beam between my eyes and the person who I\u2019m interviewing\u2019s eyes. And I almost want to put my hands on their shoulders as we\u2019re talking. It\u2019s a lock-in experience. And the energy is so intense that it runs out pretty quick. So we picked 40 because we run on the hour, and it\u2019s 10 minutes to get ready for the interview and 10 minutes to cool down. So, yeah, but it\u2019s important\u2026 And again, that works. \u2026to have that structure. Yeah. Yeah. So it\u2019s a better structure, and it works. And the facilitators will always say, start by asking that question that you\u2019ve always wanted to ask, cause the time goes by so quickly. So they become these very intense conversations from beginning to end and people are pretty spent by the end. That\u2019s interesting, because I do something that, when I first started in public radio, they told me you can\u2019t do this, right? I do 60 to 90 minutes. And I think what happens is that a real conversation fills the space it\u2019s given, right? And I often find that the thing builds and builds, and you have to make a commitment sometimes, in our show, for the first 10 or 20 minutes, because then the conversation really gets going, and you can imagine this. We\u2019ve had editors come in who say, just start there. Start in the middle, where the thing is \u2014 where you\u2019ve got this peak moment. But I say, that\u2019s not how a conversation works. You get to that moment. And you can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not fair to the listener or the conversation to not let it build. But it\u2019s a different dynamic. And I think, I think that when you\u2019re in the 60-to-90-minute range, you\u2019re in the same range of 40. Those are not long interviews when you\u2019re talking to someone about their entire life. The sweep of their life, right. And I think the difference with the StoryCorps interviews is that, in many cases, these two people who know this other person better than anyone else in the world. So they can start at that spot. And then you have no \u2014 also no video in the booth, right? Nope. Never will. So tell me in your words why that\u2019s important. It goes back to a bunch of things we\u2019ve been talking about. The voice, to me, the power of this thing is the voice. The lights are low. You don\u2019t have to worry about what you look like. And video just wouldn\u2019t add anything. We do a photograph of everybody at the end of the interview. But the way it\u2019s set up is \u2014 it\u2019s simple and perfect, so we don\u2019t mess with it. When I started StoryCorps, I actually didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have stories for the radio. And I didn\u2019t care that much. I thought that if we did have stories, they\u2019d start repeating, because there are only so many conversations a grandkid could have with a grandparent. But it turns out that they don\u2019t repeat, except that they all are in some ways about the great themes of human existence. Right. I heard you say birth, life, and death is what it always comes down to. Yeah, that\u2019s right. All of them. You can listen again and share this conversation with David Isay through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with David Isay, the creator of StoryCorps. We\u2019re talking about our shared love of listening and the importance of creating spaces to tell our stories to each other. You may have heard StoryCorps vignettes on NPR \u2014 short, edited versions of 40-minute conversations between two people who know each other intimately. This oral history project travels the country and has collected over 60,000 stories, with an archive at the Library of Congress. One criticism sometimes of StoryCorps on NPR, of the radio pieces, is that they\u2019re emotionally manipulative. They take you into this deep dive, as you say, that makes you cry in a number of seconds. Yeah, I don\u2019t think of it that way. I think what\u2019s happening, I hope, is that when people hear these stories, they\u2019re walking in the footsteps of someone who they, almost by definition, they thought was very different than themselves. But I think that these are \u2014 Sorry. That was a telephone on, unexcusable. I thought I had turned that off. Hold on, let me try this again. OK. I forgive you. Thank you. You said your \u2014 the StoryCorps booth is like a confessional. You\u2019re absolved of your sin here. Thank you. I appreciate that. OK. I think there\u2019s nothing about these \u2014 you\u2019re not watching these people from the outside. And I think that most of them aren\u2019t sad. People get emotional when they hear StoryCorps stories, and from what I can tell, it\u2019s because they\u2019re authentic, when we\u2019re surrounded by so much stuff that\u2019s not. And they\u2019re generous, and you\u2019re hearing about regular people living lives of generosity and, often, courage and decency. And you\u2019re showing us this path, and when you hear those kinds of stories, you\u2019re walking on holy ground. And I think that\u2019s why people get emotional when they hear them. And I think that for some people, getting emotional makes them uncomfortable. And the criticism may come from there. I guess what also occurred to me when I was getting ready to talk to you is that, what you can\u2019t do in boiling even 40 minutes down\u00A0\u2014 40 minutes is not a long time. But in your story, you talked about secrets, right? And every family has secrets. And secrets are painful, and your mother has actually written a lot about this. She works with this. And so what we all know is that if you sat down for 40 minutes and had a true conversation about birth, life, and death with the people you know best, there are going to be hard things in that 40 minutes, also. Absolutely. Possibly redemptive at the same time. I think that\u2019s what you do. You create a space in which the hardness and the redemption are there together. But I just \u2014 I think maybe that is what cannot be condensed into two minutes, or three minutes, or five minutes. As you\u2019re speaking, it reminds me of something I\u2019ve taken a lot from the different people you\u2019ve had on your show. And I always \u2014 I carry around me whenever I give a speech a little thing that I read beforehand that reminds me about what it is and why we\u2019re doing it. And one of the people on your show, I think it might have been Rachel Naomi Remen. Oh, Rachel Naomi Remen, yes. \u201CListening generously.\u201D Yep. She said that the keepers of wisdom in our culture are the people who\u2019ve experienced the most difficult things in their lives. And the view from the edge of life is much clearer than the view that most of us have. And I think that we\u2019re in the wisdom business. And what we\u2019re trying to do every week is let people learn from someone else about the lessons they\u2019ve learned in life. And a lot of times, it comes out of difficult circumstances. Yeah. You make this equation, \u201CListening is an act of love.\u201D And I just wondered if you\u2019d talk about that a little bit. Yeah, I think that sitting and being present with someone, and asking them important questions is something that doesn\u2019t happen that often during the course of day-to-day life, and is one of the most profound and powerful ways we have to tell someone else how much we love them. Just asking them who they are and what they\u2019ve learned in life. And how they want to be remembered. I always find \u2014 I do maybe one or two StoryCorps interviews every year. And it\u2019s always in the middle of this crazy day, and I\u2019m like, I really don\u2019t want to do this. And it\u2019s usually a staff member who\u2019s been with us for five, or six, seven, eight, nine years who\u2019s leaving. And then I\u2019ll go and sit with this person, and it\u2019s like time stops. And it\u2019s one of the most remarkable and nourishing experiences that I know of. But in many ways, I think, StoryCorps is about mortality. And I was with Ira Byock earlier this week, who was \u2026 Yes, we had him on the show. He\u2019s a physician who works with people who are dying. Yeah. In many ways, he talks about the four things you say to someone, which are \u201Cthank you,\u201D \u201CI love you,\u201D \u201Cforgive me,\u201D \u201CI forgive you.\u201D And that\u2019s something that he talks about as being a conversation people want to have before you die. And in some ways, I think what\u2019s happening in StoryCorps is that you have the opportunity to have that conversation now. We\u2019re all dying, I guess. Yeah, right. I don\u2019t know if you experience this, too. I said this a minute ago a little bit but I\u2019ll say it again. I feel like there\u2019s this \u2014 it\u2019s like we\u2019re remembering that we\u2019re listening creatures. But the way we set up our culture in the last period, it doesn\u2019t actually make space. That listening is an everyday art, and it\u2019s a social technology. But we have to \u2014 we almost have to put lofty language around it like that to \u2014 you have to create StoryCorps, right? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not really asking a question, I\u2019m just thinking out loud. It makes me think \u2014 all of us are capable of this. I had thought that, with StoryCorps, I had wondered whether people on the interviewing side were going to be able to do it. And everybody is able to do it. StoryCorps was created the same year as Facebook. And in some ways, it\u2019s \u2014 I do think that \u2014 there\u2019s something I can\u2019t put my finger on. We\u2019ve been talking about this earlier, but I think listening to these stories or participating, that, I don\u2019t know, it brings you in. And it\u2019s not an observing thing. It\u2019s a deep connection thing. And I find, sometimes, with some of the technology stuff, and I\u2019m \u2014 thank God for technology, StoryCorps couldn\u2019t happen without it. But there\u2019s like a remove and an observing thing as opposed to a connecting thing. And listening carefully. And people will ask, especially when I used to do documentaries, \u201CHow do you get people to open up?\u201D Whether I was in prisons or whatever, and I\u2019d say, just be genuinely curious, don\u2019t be a jerk, and just really listen closely to someone, and remarkable things are going to happen. I was talking to \u2014 there\u2019s a great writer, Alex Kotlowitz, who I was talking to recently, and we were talking about, we\u2019re doing stuff with post-9/11 veterans. And we\u2019re talking about this experience of when you\u2019re talking to folks who have served \u2014 and folks in all circumstances\u00A0\u2014 someone will tell this amazing story and then you say, \u201CHave you ever told that story before?\u201D The answer\u2019s no. And then you say, \u201CWhy not?\u201D \u201CWell, no one\u2019s ever asked.\u201D Is there an opening question? Doesn\u2019t StoryCorps have a list of suggested questions? Or is there a way to begin? Right. Yes, so we have the 10 most popular questions. And then we have many, many others that people can choose from, depending on who they\u2019re interviewing. And also fill-in-the-blanks that people can ask. And the 10 most popular questions are big life questions that we talked about before. \u201CHow do you want to be remembered?\u201D And that sort of stuff. And again, it goes back to this idea that the microphone gives you the license to have these conversations that you don\u2019t normally get to have. Yeah, and also as you say, that\u2026 So people jump in with difficult questions. \u2026you have people together who already have an intimate bond and so they don\u2019t have to get there. So you can really plunge into those questions. Can I ask you, when you interviewed your father, what questions you brought into that? The things you\u2019d wanted to ask? Yeah. I think I spent a lot of time talking about his childhood, because that was something he told us about a lot when we were growing up. And I wanted to find out some stuff about who his parents were, and try and get that down. And then some of the bigger questions, like, the \u201CHow do you want to be remembered?\u201D sort of questions, as well. People ask me why I always start with some version of the question about the spiritual or religious background of someone\u2019s childhood. Right. It\u2019s funny, I never \u2014 I listen to the show, and I never realized that. Yeah, well, you don\u2019t always hear it, because \u2026 I guess you do. You include it on every show? Well, we have \u2014 you know what? Interestingly, this is one of the things in the beginning, it didn\u2019t feel like NPR to me, you know? So we used to edit it. You used to not hear it. And the thing is, it is absolutely true that everyone has an interesting story in response to that question, even a cradle atheist has a great story to tell about the spiritual background of their childhood. But the real reason for me that the question is essential is that \u2014 where it plants people in themselves. That\u2019s right. Yep. And so, I don\u2019t have that shared experience with somebody I\u2019m talking to. But it opens them up in a place that\u2019s softer and more searching. And then it makes other things possible later. Yeah, I think people have their set pieces. And probably no one has ever been asked before about their religious background growing up. So, immediately, you\u2019re throwing them out of that, whatever it is, the skip on the record player that they\u2019re used to telling the same stories over and over again. Yeah. So, Dave, I just want to say to you, since here we are, in this conversation, that \u2014 you may or may not remember this \u2014 but you came to American Public Media when I was just starting my show in 2003. And I don\u2019t even think it was a weekly show yet, and I know you\u2019d never heard of me, and I asked to see you. I asked to meet you, because you were in the building. And you so generously agreed and you had no idea who I was, or what my work was. But I think I told you that I felt like you were a role model, that your approach to listening was so kindred to me. And it just occurred to me as I was getting ready to talk to you, and I\u2019m reading about you, that you actually listened to me at a moment when I\u2019d say most of the people in our industry were just not ready, or interested, and also what I was doing wasn\u2019t good yet. I had to learn what I was doing. So, I just want to thank you for that, actually. Well, thank you. That\u2019s one of the things about a StoryCorps interview, which I love, is that often at the end of the interviews, the person asking the questions, we suggest they might want to turn the tables and thank the person that they\u2019re interviewing for the influence they\u2019ve had on their lives. So that means a lot. I told you before we turned on the tape that On Being and Speaking of Faith before that have had a profound influence on helping me articulate and understand what we\u2019re trying to do with StoryCorps. Sometimes, we live \u2014 what we\u2019re doing is a little bit out of sync with the pop culture, right? And it\u2019s easy to get psyched out and say, what are we doing? What are we doing here? But that out-of-sync-ness feels important to me to dwell with. Just a minute ago, you said \u2014 I love this \u2014 that StoryCorps started the same year as Facebook. And I also think that, when I talk about how there\u2019s a cultural awakening in this sphere, there are a lot of related phenomena, although many of them are quite different. Facebook is related in a way. We are reaching out to each other. TED Talks. Right? But the growth of those things is spurred by some of the same impulses, that we are actually of interest to each other. But those things don\u2019t require the commitment. You\u2019ve said before, \u201CWhat I\u2019m looking for is poetry on the margins.\u201D And poetry hurts a little bit going in. Marie Howe, the poet, said that to me. It\u2019s like something we crave, and yet we have to steel ourselves to take it in. And I think wonderful things have always happened on the margins in human history. So I just think naming the fact that this listening, listening as an act of love is so much more than being quiet while the other person speaks. Yeah. No, it\u2019s true. And it is out of sync. I was just looking at \u2014 you had Walter Brueggemann, who said, \u201COur culture is organized against history. There\u2019s a depreciation of memory and a ridicule of hope.\u201D And when you talk about the criticisms of StoryCorps \u2014 and I don\u2019t get too many of them \u2014 but, again, I feel like it\u2019s a little out of step with the culture, but this is what we should be doing. We\u2019ve just got to keep going, keep going. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had that feeling, as well. Yeah. Absolutely. I wondered if you\u2019ve ever heard this quote of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Do you know who he is? Oh, yeah, of course. He was a German theologian. He died in a Nazi prison. Have you ever heard him on listening from his book Life Together? No, but I\u2019m going to have to write this down. I can send it to you. But I love, love, love, love this quote. It\u2019s one of my favorite \u2014 it\u2019s my favorite words in the annals of theology on listening. And then I just thought, how exciting, how fun it would be to read it to you. So I\u2019m just going to read you parts of it. It\u2019s a long section. And Bonhoeffer thought so hard and deeply about \u2014 this was his book Life Together, about Christian community, about human community. So he says, \u201CThe first service that one owes to others in the fellowship consists in listening to them. Just as love of God begins with listening to His word, so the beginning of love for the brethren is learning to listen to them. It is God\u2019s love for us that He not only gives us His word, but also lends us His ear.\u201D He says, \u201CChristians, especially ministers, so often think they must always contribute something when they\u2019re in the company of others, that this is the one service they have to render. They forget that listening can be a greater service than speaking. Many people are looking for an ear that will listen. He who can no longer listen to his brother will soon be no longer listening to God either. This is the beginning of the death of the spiritual life.\u201D Isn\u2019t that great stuff? Beautiful. Yeah. You know that first time we met \u2013 and I do remember that \u2014 you said, I think you should read \u2014 and I guess I might have just been starting to create StoryCorps. You said, you should read Parker Palmer. Yes. The Quaker author. Right. Yep, which I did. And that was an influence, as well. I think of \u2014 there\u2019s that quote \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t know if this is an apocryphal story or not, but there\u2019s a story about Dan Rather interviewing Mother Theresa. And he asked her what she said during her prayers. And she said, \u201CI listen.\u201D And, Rather then said, \u201CWell, then, what does God say to you?\u201D And she said, \u201CHe listens.\u201D Really? I\u2019m so glad you told me that. I\u2019ve never heard that before. There\u2019s one quote I can give back to you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with my fellow listener, StoryCorps founder David Isay. That title of Parker Palmer\u2019s book, Let Your Life Speak, also could be a mission statement for you or me, in a way. To say that StoryCorps, that this work of listening is about every life mattering. And I know it\u2019s obvious to you. And I know you\u2019re living it. It\u2019s just not actually a sentence that \u2014 when you say it, I think everybody who\u2019s listening is like, oh yeah. It makes sense. It\u2019s something we may know, but we don\u2019t know how to articulate or live. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s StoryCorps in a nutshell. Every life matters. But the funny thing is that other than interviewing people, I can be a really terrible listener. Really? The worst. I\u2019m impatient. This is the confessional aspect of our StoryCorps, of our booth experience here. Yeah, I am just a terrible listener. Are you really? But \u2014 yes. Would your children say that? No. No. But my wife would. At times I can be a great listener, but it takes a lot of focus and energy, and all of us have our moments. And I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m impatient. But, again, what StoryCorps does is it forces you back into the space where you can find your highest self. This is probably why it\u2019s another very simple reason that listening is not something that we do all the time. It\u2019s work. It\u2019s a commitment. But, again, to all the people out there who I run into who say, we want to make room for listening. It\u2019s something that we have to start practicing more, right? And it\u2019s something you never regret. You never regret. It\u2019s like all this \u2014 it\u2019s when you\u2019re talking about the social media stuff, and it\u2019s nourishing as opposed to being depleting. And I find that there\u2019s so much out there that we\u2019re all addicted to in the content and other stuff that we encounter. Or many of us are addicted to. There are some lucky people who aren\u2019t. But all that stuff just feels like it chips away at you a little bit. And what I hope happens with StoryCorps, and certainly happens with your show, is that it\u2019s additive as opposed to taking something away, that it nourishes who you are. Right. And in a way, by creating structures, creating a booth, or creating a project, or whatever else other people can create where they live, you send some courage out, right? For people to walk into that experience that they may want, but that requires something of us. And it does take courage. When we have booths in cities, they\u2019re always full, but there aren\u2019t huge waiting lists. And when we have a mobile booth that pulls into a town, we can have hundreds and hundreds, maybe more people on a waiting list two minutes after \u2014 two seconds after reservations open. And I think that\u2019s because people know that this booth is only there for six weeks, and they\u2019ve got to get in. And that creates this tension. As opposed to when something\u2019s in your town, and it\u2019s very easy to say \u2014 because you\u2019re dealing with hard stuff, and you\u2019re dealing with mortality, and you\u2019re dealing with connection, it\u2019s easy to say, I can do it next week. I can do it next week. I can do it next week. So that\u2019s something that we see. Well, are there tools, are there things you\u2019ve learned through StoryCorps that do make you a better listener, even though you say you\u2019re constitutionally not inclined that way? That make me a better listener? Yeah. Or things you know. Tricks. Like if you ever catch yourself just being a human being and not the head of StoryCorps. Yeah. You know when you\u2019re listening carefully and when you\u2019re not. It\u2019s that, we\u2019ve come back to this a couple of times. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re locked into another human being. Either you\u2019re locked in or you\u2019re not. And I was an equally bad listener before starting StoryCorps, but also did very, very intense interviews with people. So, no, that hasn\u2019t changed for me. I think that what has changed \u2014 well, there are a couple of things. I think that what I\u2019ve learned is \u2014 I knew that being listened to was important to people, but I don\u2019t think I understood how important it was. And how widespread it is that people feel like they\u2019re not listened to and never heard, and have things that they want to say and leave behind. I think StoryCorps itself has made me a much more hopeful person. It\u2019s made me much more hopeful about people and much more committed to the idea that we focus so much on what very, very, very few people have to say. And that we would be such a better and stronger country if we widened that out and listened to what the rest of us have to say and have learned in life. And do you find that the stories you hear as being part of StoryCorps, that they work on you, in you, as you then live your life? Yeah. Oh, totally. I get the question a lot, like, \u201CHow come you don\u2019t spend all day crying?\u201D And I don\u2019t spend all day crying. But I\u2019ve learned a lot of things from listening to these interviews that I carry around with me all the time. There\u2019s an interview with a father who lost two kids on September 11. And he talks about how the last words he said to his kids, and the last words he heard, were \u201CI love you,\u201D and what comfort that gives him. And you can bet that I say \u201CI love you\u201D many times every day. I think that there are very, very simple lessons that run through these stories that have completely shaped my life and the way that I live it. That\u2019s wonderful. Well, Dave, you say that your gift is collecting other people\u2019s deep thoughts and that\u2019s certainly true, but you have so many deep thoughts of your own, and I\u2019m really grateful to you for sitting down with me, and I\u2019m really excited to put this on the air. Well, thank you. This was really fun. I wrote a note to myself \u2014 I wrote \u201Cjust surrender.\u201D Good. . OK, well you did. Congratulations. I think you accomplished that. David Isay is the founder of StoryCorps and winner of the 2015 Ted Prize. He\u2019s just released a new StoryCorps book titled Callings: The Purpose and Passion of Work. StoryCorps\u2019 archives are held at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. In addition to their recording booths, and as part of the TED Prize, StoryCorps has created an app that allows users anywhere to record and upload their personal interviews directly to a digital archive. And here\u2019s an excerpt David Isay edited and shared with us from the StoryCorps interview he did with his late father, Richard Isay. What was the happiest moment of your life? When \u2014 I think I was about 11 years old and my mother came after me with a hairbrush and chased me around the bed, and I held her arms and she couldn\u2019t hit me anymore. Are you serious? Yeah. Is that the happiest moment of your life? I think I am happier now than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. So it\u2019s \u2014 happiness is a continuing process. What do you think is the most important thing that you\u2019ve accomplished in your life? What are you proudest of? I\u2019m very proud of you kids. I am very proud of the work I\u2019ve done. And I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one. You think about dying? All the time. Are you scared of dying? No, I think about \u2014 well, I don\u2019t want to be infirm. I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore. It\u2019s more an absence of that. You think I was a good father? I think you were a good father, you\u2019re still a good father."
