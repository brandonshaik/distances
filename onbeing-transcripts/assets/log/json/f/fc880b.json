  "fullText": "All of reality is interaction. This everyday truth is as scientific as it is philosophical and political, and it unfolds with unexpected nuance in Carlo Rovelli\u2019s science. He\u2019s the author of the global bestseller Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. This tiny book is, in my mind, the science writing equivalent of moving from prose to poetry. He\u2019s taken up vast ideas beyond most of our imagining \u2014 like quanta, grains of space, and time and the heat of black holes. He\u2019s condensed them into spare, beautiful words that render them newly explicable and moving. Seeing the world through this physicist\u2019s eyes, there is no such thing as \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Cnow.\u201D Our senses convey a picture of reality that narrows our understanding of its fullness. This is also true of \u201Cthe huge wave of happenings,\u201D as he puts it, \u201Cwhich is a human self.\u201D A thing is something which remains equal to itself. A stone is a thing because I can ask where the stone is tomorrow, while a happening is something that is limited in space and time. A kiss is not a thing because I cannot ask, \u201CWhere is a kiss tomorrow? Where\u2019s this kiss tomorrow?\u201D I mean, it\u2019s just happened now. I see, OK. And I think that we don\u2019t understand the world as made by stones, by things. We understand the world made by kisses, or things like kisses \u2014 happenings. Yeah. So, even for you, a stone seen in \u2014 with a long expanse of time and an understanding of how it became what it is. It\u2019s a happening; not a thing. Yeah. We live 100 years, but suppose we lived a billion years. A stone would be just a moment in which some sand gets together, and then it disaggregates. So it\u2019s just a momentary getting-together of sand. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Carlo Rovelli is professor of physics at Aix-Marseille University, where he is director of the quantum gravity group at the Center for Theoretical Physics. He is one of the founders of Loop Quantum Gravity theory \u2013 an attempt to reconcile the fact that the two pillars of 21st century physics \u2013 general relativity and quantum mechanics \u2013 contradict each other. Carlo Rovelli was born in Verona, Italy, and was in a studio in France for this conversation. I think something, a quality that runs through all of your writing, seems to be this kind of intertwined, interactive curiosity about \u2014 and commitment to both physics as well as philosophy and history. And I\u2019m curious as we start, if you trace the roots of these passions, and the connection you see between them, in your earliest life, do you think was sparked by something in your childhood? I think physics, philosophy, and history are not very separated because they\u2019re all parts of a common desire to understand better the world around us. And there are many ways of being a scientist. One can be a scientist because he\u2019s in love with mathematics, or somebody else can be a scientist because he\u2019s in love with this specific problem and likes to plunge into one specific thing. But then there are scientists who are just curious about the world in general and how the world is made. What can we learn about the way the world works? And there are many of those, and I\u2019m one of those. And from that perspective, science is just learning the great scheme of things as much as possible. And for that, philosophy is very close, and history is the path of this discovery. And I think science is not a set of acquired knowledge. It\u2019s the journey toward the acquiring more and more knowledge. I spent my youth traveling and being a little bit revolutionary in the Italian politics of the time. And at some point, we wanted to change the world. I\u2019m of that generation. We failed. And at some point, I just fell in love with physics, that I was \u2014 I was taking some classes in physics. And I said, \u201COh, this is fantastic because this allows me to see more far than what I\u2019ve been seeing so far. This allows me to really learn something completely new and to see what\u2019s wrong in common way of thinking.\u201D So, I have to tell you. I read Seven Brief Lessons on Physics this past summer, and I just found it astonishingly beautiful. Oh, thank you. So, what I would like to do is walk through some of the observations you make that I just feel are immediately \u2014 one can immediately capture and reflect on as a human being, whether you know science or not. And here\u2019s a line of what I would say \u2014 the poetry of the book. \u201CHere in the vanguard, beyond the borders of knowledge, science becomes even more beautiful. Incandescent in the forage of nascent ideas, of intuitions, of attempts, of roads taken then abandoned, of enthusiasms. And the effort to imagine what has not yet been imagined.\u201D Yeah, congratulations to my translator in English. It\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s wonderful. Yeah. My translators are very, very good. The fascination of science is not what we have learned; it is the process of learning. It\u2019s the discovery. I mean, there\u2019s the wonder of what we learn. \u201CWow.\u201D Then the wonder creates more curiosity, and then we realize that there\u2019s so much we have not learned yet. I don\u2019t think we are near the end of physics at all. I don\u2019t think we are near the end of science at all. There is so much to be discovered. And the beauty of the scientific enterprise is that we are in touch with the unknown, what we don\u2019t know, and we try to make steps into it. So, that\u2019s a strength of science, that it works out of beauty, out of intuition, out of imagination, but it has a very solid way then of checking. And which also means that some \u2014 many beautiful ideas turn out to be wrong. And I think \u2014 you also write about, and many people have \u2014 I mean, that Einstein is this singular mind through which the general theory of relativity came together, a coherent vision of gravity, space, and time. And yet, even Einstein struggled with what happened \u2014 with the discoveries he made, I mean, with the emergence of quantum theory because he really wanted there to be some kind of overriding objective reality that we could describe. A driving point that you make as you describe quantum physics, and really all of physics, is we must accept the idea that reality is interaction. Yeah. This is a very general point in science. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m able to articulate entirely, but I think it comes out for many sciences, and certainly from quantum mechanics, but also from others, we do understand the world better not in terms of things, but in terms of interaction between things, and how things interact with one another, even in biology. We understand biology in terms of evolution, how things change, and how \u2014 we understand the antelope because there\u2019s a lion and the lion because there\u2019s antelope. We don\u2019t have them in isolation. Antelope. Yeah. Antelope. Sorry. And at the core of quantum physics, this comes out very, very strongly. Somehow, quantum physics does not describe how things are, but how things interact with one another. So, I think this is general \u2014 even we human beings \u2014 I\u2019m not a thing; I\u2019m a net of interactions with the world around me, with the people who know me, who love me. It\u2019s a more powerful way of trying to grasp reality by focusing on what interacts with what and how. And somehow, the objects are just the nodes of interactions. They\u2019re not primary thing; they\u2019re secondary thing, I think. So, when I was growing up and studying science in school in a very rudimentary way, I learned that an atom is composed of a proton, a neutron, and electron. The way you describe what quantum physics sees is that an electron is \u201Ca set of jumps from one interaction to another,\u201D and in fact, electrons only exist when they\u2019re interacting with something else. Yes. This is at the core of quantum mechanics, which is one of the parts of modern physics, which is totally central, and at the same time we understand less. Quantum mechanics works spectacularly well. I mean, we have computers based on quantum mechanics. We have all sorts of technology based on quantum mechanics. And still, there\u2019s something mysterious about it, something slippery about it. It\u2019s not a clean, transparent theory, which means that we have to, I suppose, struggle more to understand it. Behind all that is the fact that we understand so much about the world, but we\u2019re not so smart, after all. The world is complicated. It\u2019s immensely complicated. And so, we understand bits and pieces of it, which allow us to do all sorts of things, I mean, to go to the moon, to understand that there are black holes, to \u2014 all sorts of things. But at the same time, we know that both at the core of all this and in parts we haven\u2019t explored yet, there\u2019s so much we \u2014 still to do to better understand the world. You wrote\u2026 And\u2026 Yeah, go on. No, no. Please. There\u2019s a little gap here, so sometimes when you\u2019re speaking, I can\u2019t \u2014 so just forgive me for interrupting, and we can edit this out. So keep going. I\u2019m Italian, so we interrupt one another all the time. All right. OK, good. Well, you wrote this: \u201CIt\u2019s as if God had designed reality with a line that was not heavily scored, but just dotted it with a faint outline.\u201D Yes. One of the key aspects of quantum mechanics is, as you were saying, we cannot think as an electron, as a little stone that moves in space, and is here, and then here, and then here, and then here. It has different modes of happening. So one way \u2014 one alternative way is just to think that it sort of materialized here, and then materialized here, and materialized there. That\u2019s one way of thinking of quantum mechanics. It goes back to the beginnings. Heisenberg is one of the scientists that first entered into this magic of quantum mechanics. And I like this idea because as the world becomes more light, is less full, so I use this image. I\u2019m an atheist, so this reference to God, it\u2019s more literary referenced than\u2026 And when you say \u201Cwhen the world becomes more light,\u201D what do you mean? I think that \u2014 let me put it in this way. There is one view of the scientific descriptions of the world, which is the world is just matter. There are particles moving around. This is 18th century physics. It\u2019s not true anymore. It has changed. And then in the sort of 19th century, there was a period in which physics was saying, \u201CWell, maybe we understand it\u2019s just energy. There\u2019s all forms of energy.\u201D That\u2019s not true anymore because in general relativity, you cannot think in terms of energy. There\u2019s else. So, now we think in terms of quantum fields on space time. But if you do \u2014 if you want to go quantum gravity, you cannot think in those terms, either. So, the stuff of the world is not something we have clear. The stuff of the world, fundamental physics, is not heavy matter. It\u2019s much more light. And the way we describe it is in terms of interaction between systems. Let me give you a pictorial thing. It\u2019s like a little flash here, a little flash there when two things interact. In that sense, there is lightness. And also, in that sense, the world is very, very different from our sort of daily intuition. Our image of things, and things that remain time, and time passes, and space where things are immersed. All this, it\u2019s not wrong, of course, but is an approximation. It\u2019s like the flat Earth. The Earth is flat around us, but if you look a little bit on a larger scale, it\u2019s not flat, it\u2019s round. So, on a larger scale, the world is very different from our intuition. And it simplifies, like space becomes a gravitational field. A lot of different things become the same thing. It simplifies. And what I try to do in the book is give an overall picture of the way I understand it, with the understanding that we are far from a final picture. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the physicist Carlo Rovelli, who\u2019s written the slim, beautiful bestseller Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. So, for example, here\u2019s something. When you write about particles, you say, on the one hand, \u201Cthere is no such thing as a real void,\u201D one that is completely empty. I mean, even the word \u201Cspace,\u201D I think, is outdated because space suggests\u2026 It is outdated. It suggests something empty. But what you say \u2014 what\u2019s there instead, as you say, is \u201Ca world of happenings, not of things.\u201D Yes. A thing is something which remains equal to itself. A thing \u2014 a stone is a thing because I can ask where the stone is tomorrow, while a happening is something that is limited in space and time. I don\u2019t know. A kiss is not a thing, because I cannot ask, \u201CWhere is a kiss tomorrow? Where\u2019s this kiss tomorrow?\u201D I mean, it\u2019s just happened now. I see. OK. And I think that we don\u2019t understand the world as made by stones, by things. We understand a world made by kisses, or things like kisses, happenings. In other words, the elementary quantities or ingredients for describing the world are not things which remain through time. They are just limited in space and time. And I think which remain through time are processes that repeat themselves. A stone is just a common flickering of electrons and things and stuff, which remains together not even forever, of course, because it goes into powder for a long time, for a while. So, to better understand the world, I think we shouldn\u2019t reduce it to things. We should reduce it to a happenaing, and the happenings are always between different systems, always relations. Or always like a kiss, which is something that happens between two persons. So, even for you, a stone is a happening, is seen in with a long expanse of time and an understanding of how it became what it is. It\u2019s a happening, not a thing. Yeah. I mean, we live 100 years, but suppose we lived a billion years. A stone would be just a moment in which some sand gets together and then it disaggregates. So it\u2019s just a momentary getting-together of sand. The permanence of things is \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of \u2014 we look at them for a short time with respect to their own staying-together. I want to read another passage from your writing. \u201CA handful of types of elementary particles, which vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and non-existence, and swarm in space, even when it seems that nothing is there, combined together to infinity, like the letters of a cosmic alphabet, to tell the immense history of galaxies, of the innumerable stars, of sunlight, of mountain, woods, and fields of grain, of the smiling faces of the young at parties, and of the night sky studded with stars.\u201D Thank you for reading this. I think what I wanted to convey is the sense that if you think that reality is just quantum fields and \u2014 or atoms, or nothing else, it does not mean that it\u2019s dry. It means that there is \u2014 out of that, there is space for incredible complexity including the galaxies, the woods, the forest, and including our own emotions, our own complexity as human beings. To think in \u2014 that the scientific description of the world, it\u2019s basically right. There\u2019s nothing else from it. It does not mean denying the complexity of what we are. To the opposite, it means bringing together in a unitary way with what we know about the world. And it seems to me that our understanding of time, well, as well as space, but let\u2019s stay with time, as \u2014 what did Einstein say? \u201CTime is a stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201D Or our sense of times, past, present, and future, this arrow moving forward. Time, I think, we all experience as this basic element we move through, and work with, and struggle with, and try to control, and organize, or lose to through the course of every day. And I feel like the way Einstein reimagined \u2014 the way physics has \u2014 understands time now is just such a huge example of how we have yet to even to begin to internalize the reality of time. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s sort of a complicated sentence. Yes, very well. I know what you say very well. First of all, it intrigues you, and intrigues me, and I think intrigues many people. What has happened is that we have learned that our direct intuition of time \u2014 we have a very good idea what time is, right? I mean, if you ask somebody who doesn\u2019t know physics what time is, he knows what time is. But that idea of time is wrong. It\u2019s not wrong for us. I mean, we have, I don\u2019t know, one hour for talking, and that\u2019s one hour, and number of years for living, and so on and so forth. But it\u2019s an approximation. It\u2019s like the Earth being flat around us. The more you learn about nature, the more you discover that, at some fundamental level, time is not there. And in the basic equations of the theory in which I and many colleagues are working now in quantum gravity, time is just \u2014 there\u2019s nothing like time. So in that sense, time does not exist. But does not \u2014 this doesn\u2019t mean that it does not exist for us. But let me tell you something which I think is central. You quoted a sentence by \u2014 a phrase by Einstein in which he says that time is a sort of stubborn, persistent illusion, and it doesn\u2019t exist. Einstein wrote that, but he wrote that in a letter addressed to the sister in the family of his best friend, Michele Besso, who had just died. I did not know that. Yes. So this is not in a text to physicists or to philosophers; it\u2019s in a letter to a sister who has just lost his brother, a family who has just lost a member of the family. So the content is not a discussion about the structure of reality; it\u2019s a letter to console. It\u2019s a letter in which Einstein expresses his love of Michele, who has been his companion. And in that phrase, Einstein writes, \u201CFor people like Michele and me, time is.\u201D So he\u2019s talking about his relation between \u2014 with Michele, and he\u2019s talking clearly about his own loss of Michele, and his own being in front of death because of \u2014 Einstein died one month and a little bit after Michele, so he\u2019s very close to Einstein\u2019s death. And when he\u2019s saying there is something illusory in time, I think he\u2019s talking about emotions, and he\u2019s talking about something in a sense deeper and more important than the physical nature of time. He\u2019s talking about the illusion of life, of our experiences. I don\u2019t think that phrase by Einstein should be taken too literally. So in a sense, what you\u2019re saying also is that it\u2019s partly Einstein pointing at this challenge of working with time as we understand it scientifically, and time as we understand it as human beings, or simply being \u2014 are you saying he\u2019s really just \u2014 he\u2019s being a human being there. I think he\u2019s \u2014 in that phrase is deeply being a human being. And talk about his love with Michele, and also implicitly talking about his own attitude towards death, which was coming. A month later, he\u2019s dead. But certainly, time is something which touches us in death profoundly because it\u2019s a \u2014 thinking about time is thinking about our finitude. We\u2019re not going to live forever. And what is this time in which we are immersed? I mean, there\u2019s no time on a fundamental level, and nevertheless, we human beings live in time. We live in time like fish in the water. For us, it\u2019s impossible to think of ourselves without time. So, I do think there is more to understand there, and I do think it\u2019s a different question \u2014 \u201CWhat is time in the fundamental level of physics?\u201D from the question, \u201CWhat is time for us?\u201D And for us, it touches a lot of things, including emotional things. You can listen again and share this conversation with Carlo Rovelli through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, we\u2019re exploring how all of reality is interaction with theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli. His global bestseller, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, was originally written as a series of articles for an Italian newspaper. We\u2019re experiencing how he renders vast, complex ideas winsomely and movingly. What he\u2019s learning through science is illuminating \u2014 philosophically, politically, and in terms of what Carlo Rovelli calls the constant \u201Chuge wave of happenings\u201D that is a human self. I wonder how \u2014 if it\u2019s possible to briefly describe what time is for you as a physicist. A fantastic problem to work on. It\u2019s something which \u2014 first of all, it\u2019s not a single notion. It\u2019s not either there is time, or there\u2019s not time; it\u2019s what we mean by time. When we think about time, for instance, we think time is the same for everybody, and we know it\u2019s not true. Time passes a little bit faster in the mountain, and a little bit slower near the sea. The more high you go, the more time passes fast. So it\u2019s relative to how we move, where we are, and so on. I think that, in the fundamental equation of the world, as we have understood so far, we can forget about time. They\u2019re not about how things evolve in time. It is about relations between \u2014 with invariables. I think that\u2019s more or less we can understand. The real problem is, from there, to come back, and in this timeless world, to understand what is this thing that we experience as time. And that\u2019s a problem in thermodynamics, and also, I think this probably is related to what we are as human beings. To a large extent, what we call time is our memory, our anticipation. I think we\u2019re going to understand entirely what time is when we better understand what we are. So I think that time is an approximate thing, not a fundamental thing in the world. Like up and down. Up and down makes sense here on Earth, but not in space. Right. So, you said somewhere \u2014 you wrote, \u201CThe passage of time is internal to the world, is born in the world itself.\u201D So, here\u2019s one very intriguing thing you say again as a physicist. To the question of what explains it for us, time seems to pass or to flow. And you say you believe \u201Cthis is connected to the connection between time and heat,\u201D that the difference between past and future exists only when there is heat. That is such a baffling and fascinating idea. I mean, can you explain that a little bit? Oh, yes. Oh, this is something that curiously has not been said enough. And the known physicists don\u2019t know it, but it\u2019s not something new, and it\u2019s something well established. In fact, since not the last century, but the previous century, every time we give a description of the world, of phenomena where there\u2019s no heat, we cannot distinguish the past from the future. Every time there\u2019s something that distinguishes the past from the future, there\u2019s heat. So, take a movie or something, and you run it backward. Imagine you take a movie of the Moon going around the Earth. You run it backward, and you see a Moon going around the Earth the other way. It\u2019s completely consistent with the laws of physics, and there\u2019s no heat there. But if you throw a pen on the table, and it stops, and you take a movie of that, if you run the movie backward, you see something totally absurd, a pen that starts moving from nothing. And in fact, when the pen stops, it heats the table because there\u2019s friction, and there\u2019s heat. So only when there is some heat around, the phenomena are different in one direction of time from the other. So the direction of time is deeply connected to the existence of heat. That doesn\u2019t explain the direction of time, but is the first step toward understanding it. The direction of time has to do with the presence of heat. Is there a way that we experience this unconsciously in kind of our daily interactions? Or our sense of time? Or is that just a separate experience? I think our own experience of the world, our thinking, our being, our emotions, are so much produced by our brain, our body, which are full of heat. A deeply thermodynamical thing. So we cannot get out from this presence of heat when we think about our experience. When you think, your brain produces heat. When you wake up in the morning, your body produces heat. When you have an emotion, there\u2019s heat producing. And so, we, in our experience, are children of the presence of heat in the world. I think that in a world completely without heat, we wouldn\u2019t make sense. We wouldn\u2019t be able to think. We wouldn\u2019t have memory. Memory requires heat. So because there\u2019s so much heat in us, and that we generate all the time, time, all the time, time seems to be this dynamic, rapid \u2014 I mean, I think we experience time as a bully for much of our lives, at least the way we live now. Yes. There\u2019s something we did understand about heat a little bit after having understood this relationship with time. We say that has to do with the microstructure of space. And what is heat? Heat is the fact that there are many molecules moving fast. So, the second step is to understand that heat has to do with the fact that there is a microstructure we don\u2019t see. A hot glass of water is a glass of water where the molecules move very fast. Cold glass of water is the same glass of water where the molecules don\u2019t move much, but we don\u2019t see the individual molecules. So, we talk about heat because there\u2019s a sort of defocusing. There\u2019s a big simplification in the world as we perceive it. As we perceive it. As we perceive it. Exactly. And that\u2019s what I think we should understand better, and we don\u2019t have yet understood well. So the relation between time and heat is clear, but the next step, which is how come that time, in some sense, emerges when there are many, many degrees of freedom which are not under control \u2014 that\u2019s something we should understand better. It\u2019s one of the mysteries of the \u2014 against which physics is striving at right now, I think. There\u2019s something else you say that just \u2014 I mean, I feel like we\u2019ve now really \u2014 we\u2019re really straddling physics and philosophy, as you do. Just a final thing in that sense that you say that in physics there is nothing that corresponds to \u201Cnow\u201D or to \u201Chere.\u201D That \u201Chere\u201D exists in the mind of the speaker. I just want to tell you I was just working on a program we\u2019re doing with somebody who\u2019s a brilliant person in conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. And it was so interesting to me to be revisiting your ideas and having that conversation in my mind because he also said, from a very different perspective, that \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Cnow\u201D are always subjective for all of the people sitting in a room, even if they are sitting together in the room. That \u201Chere\u201D means something different. Is a different one. It always means something different. And you\u2019re saying the same thing as a physicist through physics. Yes, the philosopher calls it \u201Cindexicality.\u201D There \u2014 let me put it this way. Physics struggles to give an objective picture of reality as much as possible, which is very fine, very good. So it\u2019s reality as seen from the \u2014 as much as possible from the outside. But if you look from the outside, you always miss something, which is the perspective from the inside. If you have a map of a region, and you want to use it, you want to know where you are in the map. So you need extra information, which is where you are. And there are words, like \u201Chere,\u201D like \u201Cme\u201D that have a meaning that depend on who says it. If I say \u201CI\u2019m Carlo,\u201D it\u2019s true. But if you say \u201CI\u2019m Carlo,\u201D it\u2019s false. So the same sentence depends on who\u2019s saying. So I think there is an aspect of reality which is strongly connected to its relational aspect. We perceive reality not from the outside, but from the inside. And there is this little difference between each one of us, obviously. And we have to keep this into account. And I think keeping this into account, it\u2019s one of the ingredients for making sense of what time is. And maybe also one of the ingredients of learning how to deal with one another a little bit better by remembering that we always have perspective on things. And everybody has a slightly different perspective than everybody else. Yes. And that\u2019s so resonant in the world right now. I mean, I think \u2014 when I was talking to this conflict resolution person \u2014 and he talks \u2014 it\u2019s basically \u2014 you can almost see it in terms of physics, that the whole \u2014 the experiences that propelled every individual in a group into a room to talk about conflict, or to interact, are so different. And that all of that is what means \u2014 all of that is going on, swirling around in each of these people, infusing what the definition of \u201Chere\u201D or \u201Cnow\u201D is. But it\u2019s all kind of beneath the surface. Just \u2014 we don\u2019t see that complexity of each other, as you\u2019re saying, just as we don\u2019t see the true complexity \u2014 somewhere you said we realize \u2014 \u201CPhysics opens windows through which we see far into the distance. What we see does not cease to astonish us. We realize that we are full of prejudices and that our intuitive image of the world is partial, parochial, inadequate.\u201D Yes. If I may say something, not as a physicist but as a human being and as a citizen, I think that a lot of what is happening now is becoming blind to the fact that we succeed cooperating, and there is an increasing \u2014 all over, not just in the United States, but also in India, and Europe, and in many parts of the world, a push towards seeing us, one another, as enemies instead of collaborators. I mean, the humanity groups, humanity as a whole, succeed if it works together, not if it works one against the other one. We have seen conflicts and war and disaster so much, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re moving in that direction. And I would like to do everything I can, but I can very little to stop this drive. And when you describe that there\u2019s this strangeness in quantum physics where particles only exist when they hit something else, is related to the fact that a human being is a set of his interactions with his fellow human beings around him. I mean, that works in every direction, right? We can be interacting as enemies, or interacting as fellow citizens with whom we\u2019re trying to build a common life. Yes. I mean, they\u2019re two different things. Of course, we can also exist as warriors, and we interact as \u2014 by making war to one another. But the result is often a disaster for everybody. If we interact by collaborating, everybody gains, I think. Right. I mean, if I take this idea of yours, this overriding idea that comes out of a life in physics that reality is only interaction, ultimately, then it seems also like the failure to interact, or the failure of interaction is actually a move against vitality, against life. Is that interpreting too much? Applying\u2026 It is an analogy. I agree with that. I think that analogies are very good, and help us. It\u2019s the two things that separated, of course. One thing is to understand that, in physics, we can better understand the world through interaction. And one thing is to export that to our politics, our society, our human life. I mean, I think analogies are good. And general \u2014 using ideas that come from one field in another one is good. It doesn\u2019t prove anything. But, look, I don\u2019t think that I, as a person, exist without the rest. I am my friends, my love, my enemies, my \u2014 everything that I interact with. All my ideas come from things I\u2019ve read, I\u2019ve talked, which are all interactions. And all what I do is interacting with the rest. And the same is true for communities. Communities are what they are because they\u2019ve been strongly influenced by different communities. And they\u2019re going to influence other communities, and so on and so forth. This, I think, is not proof of anything, but this, I think \u2014 it\u2019s going to help us if we digest that, instead of going in the direction of defending us from the others. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the physicist Carlo Rovelli, who\u2019s written the slim, beautiful bestseller, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. To me, this is a way of inserting this lesson from history that you take, that you lay out in your writing, that science does and can shape our understanding of the world, our character \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 you\u2019ve said our soul, or the quality of our presence in the world in ways that are not merely scientific. I want to ask you this. If, in fact, as the title of your book, Reality is Not What it Seems, that \u2014 I mean, again, to me, these are some of the things you\u2019ve written that seem so resonant for so much else that \u2014 \u201COur senses often don\u2019t tell us the truth about reality,\u201D \u2014 this is an interesting one, \u201Cthat understanding the world better often entails going against your intuition.\u201D But for you, on a grand scale, you have a sense of the complexity of reality and the cosmos that is so far beyond our senses. So, here\u2019s the question. How does this change the way you move through the world? Is this something you\u2019re able to kind of work with? Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m able, but I do work with. The idea that our senses can mislead us \u2014 this idea, it is very old, right? It goes back to Antiquity. In fact, it\u2019s the key idea of a good part of Greek philosophy. Some philosopher took it even too strongly, saying we shouldn\u2019t believe at all what our senses say. Reality is completely different. Nowadays, of course, we rely on what we see, but we have learned \u2014 and I think we have learned deeply \u2014 that we are like children. Namely, we start with a na\u00EFve idea about the world. We start with a na\u00EFve vision about the world. And then slowly, we learn more. We learn more because we grow. Like children grow, so society has grown, civilization has grown, and has grown by learning from experience, from other people, from books, from experiments, from all sorts of stuff. And what we have learned is, as you say, the complexity. The world is much more complex than what it looks at first sight. I look at this glass of water, and it\u2019s just quite transparent, but I know that, in fact, it\u2019s a crazy zig-zagging of molecules down there, which do all sorts of stuff, and how fast they move the temperature, and so on and so forth. And this complexity, which is at all levels, guards us from being driven by too simple-minded thing. I mean, I think we should keep in mind that the world is complex. We have a good way of dealing with the world, right? Society works, civilization works, we are alive, and we\u2019re seven billion of us on Earth, and many more than before. And in fact, we\u2019re actually more of us on Earth which are out of deep poverty and have education and things to live much more than in the past. So we\u2019re not doing too bad. But at the same time, we know that this knowledge we have, it\u2019s fragile, and we don\u2019t have full knowledge at all. Nothing guarantees that we do better tomorrow at all. We\u2019re not guaranteed by anything. I mean, civilization could stop tomorrow. The Earth is becoming warmer, and it could be a catastrophe. We are too many on Earth, and this might lead to other catastrophe. And worst of all, we are fighting against us more and more, and this could get more catastrophe. So, there\u2019s a sense of fragility, which I do have, both in the \u2014 I don\u2019t think I know the truth. I think I know a little bit about the world, and I know deeply that I have no access to any final truth, to any absolute truth. I know deeply that my brain is limited. It\u2019s something I understand. Sometimes I feel I understand better than somebody else, and sometimes no, I feel that somebody else understands better than me. And I know that my life is limited. I have a certain number of years to live, and that\u2019s it. Maybe humanity itself has a limited life. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that guarantees us beyond that. Can we live this with this uncertainty? Can we live with this fragility? I think we do, and we can. And even more, I think\u2026 And our brains also \u2014 I was just going to say I think our brains also resist fragility and resist the knowledge that our life is limited, kind of work against that reality. Maybe. I don\u2019t know. Some \u2014 we\u2019re different. Some of us more, some of us less. We are terrorized when death approaches, of course, because I think we have an instinct of escaping from the tiger when the tiger was arriving. It\u2019s a good instinct. But fear of death just by itself \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a universal feeling. I think it\u2019s a feeling that many people might not have. And we can accept the fact that our life is limited like we accept that there is a Sun, and there is the sea, and there are the mountains. It\u2019s a fact of life. In fact, I find it reassuring, not scaring, the fact that this is a short life, and that\u2019s it. And in fact, I find, because of psychology, we have \u2014 this is what makes it precious. That\u2019s why we like it. It\u2019s why we love it. If I had to live forever, which I would be scared to death of living forever, because life is beautiful, but also painful sometimes. I don\u2019t want to live forever. I want to live for a short time and as better as I can, and better with my fellow travelers through time, and expressing part of me. And I think that this fragility, this lack of full knowledge, this limitation of life, is something one can live very well with, and is much more reassuring that any potential of knowing the bottom of truth of reality or any idea of living forever. Yeah. I mean, I find it incredibly useful, I mean, I\u2019m going to be working with this now, this notion that even a human being, an individual, is not a thing, but a happening. That \u2014 right? That you say somewhere \u201Can individual is a process, complex tightly integrated.\u201D I feel that this way of thinking also about us and about ourselves and about others does let in the richness and strangeness of what it is to be human, and the complexity of our interactions with each other. Yes. And there\u2019s a complexity of interaction with the others, and there\u2019s also the complexity of our self. My body is enormously more complex than what I\u2019m aware of. The number of things that happen in my brain every second is far, far more rich than what is my awareness of myself, what I\u2019m conscious about. So we are very complicated things, which is fine. And we have a certain partial control of what we are. This is something, by the way, which is strongly emerging from modern contemporary scientific research on brains, neurons, and so on. And there\u2019s all sorts of things that happen inside us, and we have no idea why. Sometimes we\u2019re afraid, and we don\u2019t know why. Sometimes we\u2019re happy, and we don\u2019t know why. And our memory is a teeny, teeny synthesis of all information that got into us. And we are like living on the top of this huge wave of happenings, which is our self, I think. Yeah. I just \u2014 I want to read this because it\u2019s so beautiful. And then maybe you\u2019ll have just some final words. \u201CIt is part of our nature to love and to be honest. It is part of our nature to long, to know more, and to continue to learn. Our knowledge of the world continues to grow. There are frontiers where we are learning, and our desire for knowledge burns. They are in the most minute reaches of the fabric of space, at the origins of the cosmos, in the nature of time, in the phenomenon of black holes, and in the workings of our own thought processes. Here, on the edge of what we know, in contrast with the ocean of the unknown, shines the mystery and the beauty of the world. And it\u2019s breathtaking.\u201D Thank you for reading this. Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 my vision of the world is also \u2014 how would I say? It\u2019s also my dream about myself. I would like to think of myself as somebody who tries to look far away. Each of us has one dream of what we would like to be. I would like to \u2014 I see myself an explorer who tries to look ahead. And that, I think, is not, as I said before, is certainly not the only important thing for humanity, but I think it\u2019s important also that for humanity. And each of us tries to do something for humanity. And that\u2019s a direction which I\u2019ve been trying to go. What is the Italian word for breathtaking? Or what is the word you wrote in Italian? Bella da togliere il fiato. It\u2019s not a single word. It\u2019s a phrase, \u201Cto take away the breath.\u201D Bella da togliere il fiato. \u201CTo take away the breath.\u201D I see. OK. Well, I\u2019m very happy that you chose to talk to me today, however choice really works. It\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re writing these books. And thank you so much. Thank you, Krista. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.
