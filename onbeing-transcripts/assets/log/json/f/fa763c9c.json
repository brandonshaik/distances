  "fullText": "\u201CCompatibility is an achievement of love. It cannot be its precondition.\u201D Alain de Botton\u2019s essay \u201CWhy You Will Marry the Wrong Person\u201D was, amazingly, the most-read article in The New York Times in the news-drenched year of 2016. As people, and as a culture, he says, we would be much saner and happier if we reexamined our very view of love. Nowhere do we realistically teach ourselves and our children how love deepens and stumbles, survives and evolves over time, and how that process has much more to do with ourselves than with what is right or wrong about our partner. How different would our relationships be, de Botton says, if the question we asked on an early date was, \u201CHow are you crazy? I\u2019m crazy like this,\u201D and then understood that the real work of love is not in the falling, but in what comes after? We must fiercely resist the idea that true love must mean conflict-free love, that the course of true love is smooth. It\u2019s not. The course of true love is rocky and bumpy at the best of times. That\u2019s the best we can manage as the creatures we are. It\u2019s no fault of mine or no fault of yours; it\u2019s to do with being human. And the more generous we can be towards that flawed humanity, the better chance we\u2019ll have of doing the true hard work of love. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Alain de Botton is the founder and chairman of The School of Life, a gathering of courses, workshops, and talks on meaning and wisdom for modern lives, with branches around the world. He first became known for his book How Proust Can Change Your Life. His latest book is a novel, The Course of Love. So, we did speak a few years ago, but on a very different topic, and I\u2019m really excited to be speaking with you about this subject, which is so close to every life. And as I\u2019ve prepared for this, I\u2019ve realized that you\u2019ve actually \u2014 I knew that you\u2019d written the novel On Love a long time ago, but you\u2019ve really been consistently attending to this subject and building your thoughts on it and your body of work on it, which is really interesting to me. You wrote On Love at the age of 23, which is so young. And you were already thinking about this so deeply. I think this is the first line: \u201CEvery fall into love involves the triumph of hope over knowledge.\u201D Well, I think what\u2019s striking is that our idea of what love is, our idea of what is normal in love is so not normal. Is so abnormal. Right. So abnormal. And so we castigate ourselves for not having a normal love life, even though no one seems to have any of these. Or not have been loved perfectly. Right, right. So we have this ideal of what love is and then these very, very unhelpful narratives of love. And they\u2019re everywhere. They\u2019re in movies and songs. And we mustn\u2019t blame songs and movies too much. But if you say to people, \u201CLook, love is a painful, poignant, touching attempt by two flawed individuals to try and meet each other\u2019s needs in situations of gross uncertainty and ignorance about who they are and who the other person is, but we\u2019re going to do our best,\u201D that\u2019s a much more generous starting point. So, the acceptance of ourselves as flawed creatures seems to me what love really is. Love is at its most necessary when we are weak, when we feel incomplete, and we must show love to one another at those points. So we\u2019ve got these two contrasting stories, and we get them muddled, and\u2026 And also \u2014 and I feel like this should be obvious \u2014 but you just touched on art and culture and how that could help us complexify our understanding of this. And one of the things you point out about When Harry Met Sally or Four Weddings and a Funeral, one of the things that\u2019s wrong with all of that is that they \u2014 a lot of these just take us up to the wedding. They take us through the falling and don\u2019t see that \u2014 I think you\u2019ve written somewhere \u2014 and you\u2019ve said, \u201CA wiser culture than ours would recognize that the start of a relationship is not the high point that romantic art assumes; it is merely the first step of a far longer, more ambivalent, and yet quietly audacious journey on which we should direct our intelligence and scrutiny.\u201D That\u2019s right. We are strangely obsessed by the run up to love. And what we call a love story is really just the beginning of a love story, but we leave that out. But most of us, we\u2019re interested in long-term relationships. We\u2019re not just interested in the moment that gets us into love; we\u2019re interested in the survival of love over time. A lot of what you are pointing at, the work of loving over a long span of time, is inner work, right? And it would be hard to film that. But I\u2019m very intrigued by how you talk about the Ancient Greeks and their \u201Cpedagogical\u201D view of love. That\u2019s fascinating, because one of the greatest insults that you can level at a lover in the modern world apparently is to say, \u201CI want to change you.\u201D The Ancient Greeks had a view of love which was essentially based around education, that what love means \u2014 love is a benevolent process whereby two people try to teach each other how to become the best versions of themselves. Right. You say somewhere they are committed to \u201Cincreasing the admirable characteristics\u201D that they possess and the other person possesses. That\u2019s right. Your most recent book on this subject is The Course of Love, which is a novel, but it\u2019s a novel that actually I feel you kind of weave a pedagogical narrator voice into it. Do you think that\u2019s fair? That\u2019s right. Absolutely. Woven into the narrative. And you say, at one point, this is the relationship between Rabih and Kirsten. And you said, at one point, \u201CTheir relationship is secretly yet mutually marked by a project of improvement,\u201D which I think we all recognize. And then there\u2019s this moment where you say, \u201CAfter the dinner party, Rabih is sincerely trying to bring about an evolution in the personality of the wife he loves. But his chosen technique is distinctive: to call Kirsten materialistic, to shout at her, and then, later, to slam two doors.\u201D That\u2019s right. And we all recognize that scene. By the time we\u2019ve humiliated someone, they\u2019re not going to learn anything. The only conditions \u2014 as we know with children, the only conditions under which anyone learns are conditions of incredible sweetness, tenderness, patience. That\u2019s how we learn. But the problem is that the failures of our relationships have made us so anxious that we can\u2019t be the teachers we should be. And therefore, some often genuine legitimate things that we want to get across are just \u2014 come across as insults, as attempts to wound, and are therefore rejected, and the arteries of the relationship start to fur. Someone recently said to me \u2014 I\u2019m curious about how you would respond to this. It was a wise Jewish mother who had said to them, \u201CMen marry women with the intention that they \u2014 with the idea that they will the stay the same. Women marry men with the idea that they will change.\u201D Which is obviously a huge generalization. But gosh, it made a lot of sense to me, even in terms of my own life and in terms of what I see around me. Yeah. I\u00A0would argue that both genders want to change one another, and they both have an idea of who the lover should be. And I think a useful exercise that sometimes psychologists level at feuding couples is they say things like, \u201CIf you could accept that your partner would never change, how would you feel about that?\u201D Sometimes pessimism, a certain degree of pessimism can be a friend of love. Once we accept that actually it\u2019s really very hard for people to be another way, we\u2019re sometimes readier. We don\u2019t need people to be perfect is the good news. We just need people to be able to explain their imperfections to us in good time, before they\u2019ve hurt us too much with them, and with a certain degree of humility. That\u2019s already an enormous step. It\u2019s a lot to ask, but it\u2019s so \u2014 it\u2019s also \u2014 it\u2019s sounds reasonable, right? If we could really have that in our minds early enough on in a relationship. That\u2019s right. And almost from the first date. My view of what one should talk about on a first date is not showing off and not putting forward one\u2019s accomplishments, but almost quite the opposite. One should say, \u201CWell, how are you crazy? I\u2019m crazy like this.\u201D There should be a mutual acceptance that two damaged people are trying to get together because pretty much all of us \u2014 there are a few totally healthy people \u2014 but pretty much all of us reach dating age with some scars, some wounds. And sometimes, we bring to adult relationships some of the same hope that a young child might\u2019ve had of their parent. And of course, an adult relationship can\u2019t be like that. It\u2019s got to accept that the person across the table or on the other side of the bed is just human, which means full of flaws, fears, etc., and not some sort of superhuman. Yeah. And I think that question that you said could be a standard question on an early date \u2014 \u201CAnd how are you crazy?\u201D \u2014 there\u2019s also something that you\u2019re getting at that \u2014 it almost seems like we must be hardwired to do this. Although, one of the wonderful things we\u2019re learning in the 21st century is that we can change our brains. But a way you say it in On Love, in a scene in On Love is \u2014 boy meets girl, and they \u2014 you start to be enamored in details of this new person and find things in common like \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 \u201Cboth of us had two large freckles on the toe of the left foot.\u201D And then you wrote, \u201CInstinctively\u201D \u2014 and this happens very quickly \u2014 \u201Che teases out an entire personality from the details.\u201D But also, what I know from my own life is you tend to \u2014 I think we \u2014 when we fall in love with another person, we magnify in our minds those things that are immediately enrapturing and craft our idea of the other person almost exclusively around those wonderful qualities, which is not fair to them or to us. That\u2019s right. And we feel in a way that we know them already, and we impose on them an idea\u2026 And of course, we don\u2019t. Right. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. Which also explains another phenomenon that I\u2019m fascinated by \u2014 you probably would\u2019ve noticed in both novels \u2014 is the phenomenon of being in a sulk, of sulking. Because sulking is a fascinating situation which takes you right into the heart of certain romantic delusions. Because what\u2019s fascinating about sulking is that we don\u2019t sulk with everybody. We only get into sulks with people that we feel should understand us, but rather unforgivably, haven\u2019t understood us. So in other words, it\u2019s when we are in love with people and they\u2019re in love with us that we take particular offense when they get things wrong. Because the kind of the governing assumption of the relationship is, this person should know what\u2019s in my mind ideally without me needing to tell them. If I need to spell this out to you, you don\u2019t love me. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ll go into the bathroom, bolt the door, and when your partner says, \u201CIs anything wrong?\u201D You\u2019ll go, \u201CMm-mm.\u201D And the reason is they should be able to read through the bathroom panel into your soul and know what\u2019s wrong. And that\u2019s such an extraordinary demand. It\u2019s so unfair. We see it in children. This is how little children behave. They literally think that their parents can read their minds. It takes a long time to realize that the only way that one person can really learn about another is if it\u2019s explained to them, preferably using words, quite calm ones\u2026 Yes. Use your words. Which we say to children. When people always say, \u201CCommunicate,\u201D we have to be generous towards the reasons why we don\u2019t. And we don\u2019t because we\u2019re operating with this mad idea that true love means intuitive understanding. And I go crazy when people say things like, \u201CI met someone. The loveliest thing is they understood me without me needing to speak.\u201D Right. And I thought \u2014 so many alarm bells go off when I hear that because I think, \u201COK, well, good luck in this instance, but if you guys get together, that\u2019s not going to go on forever.\u201D No one can intuitively understand another beyond a quite limited range of topics. Right. Your children \u2014 how old are your children? They\u2019re still pretty young, right? Yeah. They\u2019re 10 and 12. Oh, OK. So as \u2014 now that I have young adult children, when you hear that coming out of the mouth of your 21-year-old, \u201CHe should know. He should just know.\u201D And you just \u2014 what I also know is that grasping this, what you\u2019re talking about, is work. It is the work of life, right? It is the work of growing up. It\u2019s the work of love. But it\u2019s interesting that you mention your children and children generally because I think \u2014 it sounds eerie, but I think that one of the most \u2014 one of the kindest things that we can do with our lover is to see them as children. And not to infantilize them, but when we\u2019re dealing with children as parents, as adults, we\u2019re incredibly generous in the way we interpret their behavior. And if a child says \u2014 if you walk home, and a child says, \u201CI hate you,\u201D you immediately go, OK, that\u2019s not quite true. Probably they\u2019re tired, they\u2019re hungry, something\u2019s gone wrong, their tooth hurts, something. We\u2019re looking around for a benevolent interpretation that can just shave off some of the more depressing, dispiriting aspects of their behavior. And we do this naturally with children, and yet we do it so seldom with adults. When an adult meets an adult, and they say, \u201CI\u2019ve not had a good day. Leave me alone,\u201D rather than saying, \u201COK. I\u2019m just going to go behind the facade of this slightly depressing comment\u2026\u201D And understand that that\u2019s actually not about me; that\u2019s actually about what\u2019s going on inside them today. Right, exactly. We don\u2019t do that. We take it all completely personally. And so I think the work of love is to try, when we can manage it \u2014 we can\u2019t always \u2014 to go behind the front of this rather depressing challenging behavior and try and ask where it might\u2019ve come from. Love is doing that work to ask oneself, \u201CWhere\u2019s this rather aggressive, pained, noncommunicative, unpleasant behavior come from?\u201D If we can do that, we\u2019re on the road to knowing a little bit about what love really is, I think. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring the true hard work of love with writer and philosopher Alain de Botton. I\u2019d love to talk about your \u2014 you used this word \u201Cpessimism\u201D a little while ago, and I\u2019d love to dig into that a little bit more. And what you\u2019re really talking about is being reality-based as opposed to being ideal-based. There\u2019s a beautiful video that I\u2019ve shared that\u2019s out there. I think it\u2019s \u201CThe Darkest Truth About Love.\u201D Is that right? That\u2019s the title, isn\u2019t it? Yes. That\u2019s right. Exactly. From the School of Life? Yeah. Made that for YouTube. I\u2019d like to talk through some of these core truths that fly in the face of this way we go around behaving and that movies have taught us to behave and that possibly our parents taught us to behave, these core truths that can put us on the foundation of reality. Yes, that\u2019s very useful. We could chisel them in granite. Look, one of the first important truths is, you\u2019re crazy. Not you, as it were; all of us, that all of us are deeply damaged people. The great enemy of love, good relationships, good friendships, is self-righteousness. If we start by accepting that of course we\u2019re only just holding it together, and in many ways, really quite challenging people \u2014 I think if somebody thinks that they\u2019re easy to live with, they\u2019re by definition going to be pretty hard and don\u2019t have much of an understanding of themselves. I think there\u2019s a certain wisdom that begins by knowing that of course you, like everyone else, is pretty difficult. And this knowledge is very shielded from us. Our parents don\u2019t tell us, our ex-lovers \u2014 they knew it, but they couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell us. They sacked us without\u2026 Well, by the time they tell us, we\u2019re dismissing what they say anyway. Well, that\u2019s right. And our friends don\u2019t tell us because they just want a pleasant evening with us. So we\u2019re left with a bubble of ignorance about our own natures. And often, you can be way into your 40s before you\u2019re starting to get a sense of, \u201CWell, maybe some of the problem is in me.\u201D Because of course, it\u2019s so intuitive to think that of course it\u2019s the other person. So to begin with that sense of, \u201CI\u2019m quite tricky and in these ways.\u201D That\u2019s a very important starting point for being good at love. So often we blame our lovers; we don\u2019t blame our view of love. And so we keep sacking our lovers and blowing up relationships all in pursuit of this idea of love which actually has no basis in reality. It\u2019s simply not rooted in anything we know. This right person, this creature does not exist. And is, in fact, the enemy of good enough relationships. I\u2019m really fond of Donald Winnicott, this English psychoanalyst\u2019s term, which he first used in relation to parenting, that what we should be aiming for is not perfection but a \u201Cgood enough\u201D situation. And it\u2019s wonderfully downbeat. No one would go, \u201CWhat are your hopes this year?\u201D \u201CWell, I just want to have a good enough relationship.\u201D People would go, \u201CI\u2019m sorry your life is so grim.\u201D But you want to go, \u201CNo, that\u2019s really good. That\u2019s kind of \u2014 for a human, that\u2019s brilliant.\u201D And that\u2019s, I think, the attitude we should have. In\u00A0this \u201CDarkest Truth About Love,\u201D you say the idea of love in fact distracts us from existential loneliness. You are irredeemably alone. You will not be understood. But also, behind that is the \u2014 as you say, these are dark truths, but it\u2019s also a relief, as truth always ultimately is, if we can hear it. That again, that is the work of life is to reckon with what goes on inside us. Yes. I think one of the greatest sorrows we sometimes have in love is the feeling that our lover doesn\u2019t understand parts of us. And a certain kind of bravery, a certain heroic acceptance of loneliness seems to be one of the key ingredients to being able to form a good relationship. Isn\u2019t that interesting? And it sounds paradoxical. Of course. If you expect that your lover must understand everything about you, you will be \u2014 well, you\u2019ll be furious pretty much all the time. There are islands and moments of beautiful connection, but we have to be modest about how often they\u2019re going to happen. I think if you\u2019re lonely with only \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 40 percent of your life, that\u2019s really good going. You may not want to be lonely with over 50 percent, but I think there\u2019s certainly a sizable minority share of your life which you\u2019re going to have to endure without echo from those you love. You know, I debated over whether I would discuss this with you, but I think I will. I\u2019m single right now and have been for a few years, and it\u2019s actually been a great joy. Not that I think I will be single forever or want to be single forever. Although, actually, I think I would be alright if I were, which is a real watershed. And also what this part of \u2014 this chapter of life has taught me to really enjoy more deeply and take more seriously are all the many forms of love in life aside from just romantic love or being coupled. Do people talk to you about that? Well, it\u2019s funny because just as you were saying, \u201CI\u2019m single,\u201D I was about to say, \u201CYou\u2019re not.\u201D Because we have to look at what this idea of singlehood is. We\u2019ve got this word \u201Csingle\u201D which captures somebody who\u2019s not got a long-term relationship. But I have so much love in my life. That\u2019s right. And another way of looking at love is connection. We\u2019re all the time, we are hardwired to seek connections with others. And that is, in a sense, at a kind of granular level, what love is. Love is connection. And insofar as one is alive and one is in buoyant, relatively buoyant spirit some of the time, it\u2019s because we are connected. And we can take pride in how flexible our minds ultimately are about where that connection is coming. And I think it\u2019s also worth saying that, for some people, relationships are not necessarily the place where they encounter their best selves, that actually, the person that they are in a relationship is not the person that they want to be or that they can be in other areas of life, that they feel that there are other possibilities that they\u2019d like to explore. And I think getting into a relationship with someone, asking someone to be with you is a pretty cruel thing to do to someone that you love and admire and respect because the job is so hard. Most people fail at it. When you ask someone to marry you, for example, you\u2019re asking someone to be your chauffeur, co-host, sexual partner, co-parent, fellow accountant, mop the kitchen floor together, etc., etc. And on and on the list goes. No wonder that we fail at some of the tasks and get irate with one another. It\u2019s a burden. And I think sometimes, the older I get, sometimes I think one of the nicest things you can do to someone you really admire is leave them alone. Just let them go. Let them be. Don\u2019t impose yourself on them because you\u2019re challenging. I want to read your \u2014 this definition of \u201Cmarriage\u201D that you\u2019ve written in a few places. I think it\u2019s wonderful. And just talk about this. \u201CMarriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don\u2019t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating.\u201D Well, yes. It\u2019s challenging. And it\u2019s certainly contrary to the romantic view. But again, this kind of realism or acceptance of complexity, I think, is ultimately the friend of love. I\u2019m not \u2014 look, its also worth adding \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that everybody should stay in exactly the relationship that they\u2019re in, and that any relationship is worth sticking with, and that in a way the fault is always the fault of the lovers if it\u2019s not \u2014 both lovers if it\u2019s not happy. There are legitimate reasons to leave a relationship. But if, when you\u2019re really being honest, if you ask yourself, \u201CWhy am I in pain?\u201D and you can\u2019t necessarily attribute all the sorrows that you\u2019re feeling to your lover, if you recognize that some of those things are perhaps endemic to existence, or endemic to all human beings, or something within yourself, then what you\u2019re doing is encountering the pain of life with another person but not necessarily because of another person. And because we have that power, in fact \u2014 and for example, you are, in fact, arguing \u2014 as you said before, some marriages are meant to end. And there\u2019s certainly reasons for marriages to end or to end marriages. But you also point out this very contradictory fact that the thing that\u2019s ultimately wrong with adultery as an easy out to what\u2019s going on in the marriage is that it is based on the same idealism that certain ideas of marriages are based on that go wrong. That\u2019s right. In a way that you\u2019re just redirecting your hope elsewhere and\u2026 Imagining that this is the perfect one, right? This is the one person with whom you won\u2019t ever be lonely again, who will understand you completely. That\u2019s right. And so it\u2019s \u2014 on and on the cycles of hurt continue. Something else you name about marriage that I feel is not often enough just named is that \u2014 we spoke a little while ago about children coming into a marriage. And of course, children teach us so much. One thing you say that\u2019s beautiful that children teach us that love in its purest form is a kind of service, that the love we have for our children \u2014 I certainly know this with myself \u2014 that the love I have for my children has changed me, and it is distinct from all the other loves I\u2019ve ever known. But also that children are hard on marriages, right? And for \u2014 I think, on a more complicated level, if there are problems in a marriage, that can get amplified when children are there. And it\u2019s also partly because you just get \u2014 everybody\u2019s tired. Right? That\u2019s right. It\u2019s interesting. In a way, there\u2019s a lot of mundanity in relationships. And one of the things that romanticism does is to teach us that the great love stories should be above the mundane. So in none of the great, say, 19th-century novels about love does anyone ever do the laundry, does anyone ever pick up the crumbs from the kitchen table, does anyone ever clean the bathroom. It just doesn\u2019t happen because it\u2019s assumed that what makes or breaks love are just feelings, passionate emotions, not the kind of day to day wear and tear. And yet, of course, when we find ourselves in relationships, it is precisely over these areas that conflicts arise, but we refuse to lend them the necessary prestige. There\u2019s no arguments as vicious as when two people are arguing about something, but both of them think the argument is trivial. So they\u2019ll say things like, \u201COh, it\u2019s just absurd we\u2019re arguing over who should hang up the towels in the bathroom. That\u2019s for stupid people.\u201D Right. That has nothing to do with \u2026 Right. And you know that that\u2019s going to be trouble. And so we need, in a way \u2014 one of the lessons of love is to lend a bit of prestige to those issues that crop up in love like who does the laundry and on what day. We rush over these decisions. We don\u2019t see them as legitimate. We think it\u2019s fine to\u2026 But they are. But they are. As you say, there\u2019s a lot of life that is extremely mundane. It is the stuff of life. Right. It\u2019s the stuff of our days. There\u2019s this wonderful line from The Course of Love about these two parents with children: \u201CThe tired child in each of them is furious at how long it\u2019s been neglected and in pieces.\u201D That\u2019s right. And in a way \u2014 it\u2019s so funny. If I can be indiscreet on air, my wife used to say to me, in the early days of our marriage, she sometimes would say to me things like, \u201CMy father would never have said something like\u201D \u2014 I would say something, or it\u2019s not my turn to make the tea or something. She\u2019d go, \u201CMy father would never have said it. He would always to do this for us.\u201D And then I had to point out that there was really a \u2014 she wasn\u2019t comparing like with like. She was comparing this man, her father, as a father but not as a lover. And in the end, what I say to her, did end up saying to her was, \u201CIn a way, I\u2019m probably behaving exactly like your father, but just not the father that you saw when he was around you.\u201D The way he behaved toward your mother. That\u2019s right. Exactly. And so one of the things we do as parents is to edit ourselves, which is lovely, in a way, for our children. But it gives our children a really unnatural sense of what you can expect from another human being because we\u2019re never as nice to probably anyone else on Earth as we are to our children. I\u2019m saying this is the cost of good parenting. You can listen again and share this conversation with Alain de Botton through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, we are exploring the true hard work of love with the writer and philosopher Alain de Botton. I\u2019d like to go a slightly different place with all of this. The things you\u2019ve been saying, pointing out about how love really works, that people don\u2019t learn when they\u2019re humiliated, that self-righteousness is an enemy of love. I\u2019m thinking a lot right now these days about how and if we could apply the intelligence we actually have with the experience of love, not the ideal, but the experience of love in our lives, to how we can be as citizens moving forward. Where there\u2019s a lot of behavior in public \u2014 I\u2019m speaking for the United States, but I think there are forms of this in the UK as well. We\u2019re kind of acting out in public the way we act out at our worst in relationships. I think that\u2019s fascinating. I think you\u2019re onto something huge and rather counterintuitive because we associate the word \u201Clove\u201D with private life. We don\u2019t associate it with life in the republic, with civil society. But I think that a functioning society requires two things that, again, just don\u2019t sound very normal, but they require love and politeness. And by \u201Clove\u201D I mean a capacity to enter imaginatively into the minds of people with whom you don\u2019t immediately agree, and to look for the more charitable explanations for behavior which doesn\u2019t appeal to you and which could seem plain wrong, not just to chuck them immediately in prison or to hold them up in front of a law court but to\u2026 Or just tell them how stupid they are, right? Right. Exactly. We\u2019re permanently \u2014 all sides are attempting to show how stupid every other side is. And the other thing, of course, is politeness, which is an attempt not necessarily to say everything, to understand that there is a role for private feelings, which if they were to emerge, would do damage to everyone concerned. But we\u2019ve got this culture of kind of self-disclosure. And as I say, it spills out into politics as well. The same dynamic goes on of, like, \u201CIf I\u2019m not telling you exactly what I think, then I may develop a twitch or an illness from not expunging my feelings.\u201D To which I would say, \u201CNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re preserving the peace and the good nature of the republic, and it\u2019s absolutely what you should be doing.\u201D Yes. And I guess \u2014 I\u2019ve been having this conversation with a lot of people this year. The truth is, more than ever before perhaps, in our world, we are in relationship. We are connected to everyone else. And that\u2019s a fact. Their well being will impact our well being, is of relevance to our well being and that of our children. But we have this habit and this capacity in public to \u2014 and also, we know that our brains work this way \u2014 to see the other, to see those strangers, those people, those people on the other side politically, socioeconomically, whatever, forgetting that in our intimate lives, and in our love lives, in our circles of family and friends, and in our marriages, and with our children, there are things about the people we love the most who drive us crazy that we do not comprehend. And yet, we find ways to be intelligent, right? To be loving \u2013 because it gets a better result. That\u2019s right. And families are at this kind of test bed of love because we can\u2019t entirely quit them. And this is what makes families so fascinating because you\u2019re thrown together with a group of people who you would never pick if you could simply pick on the grounds of compatibility. Compatibility is an achievement of love. It shouldn\u2019t be the precondition of love as we nowadays, in a slightly spoiled way, imagine it must be. Yes. Wonderful. I think this is deeply politically relevant. And it\u2019s\u2026 Totally. And I think if we just try and explore the world \u201Cpolitical,\u201D \u201Cpolitical\u201D really means \u201Coutside of private space.\u201D And we\u2019re highly socialized creatures who really take our cues from what is going on around us. And if we see an atmosphere of short tempers, of selfishness, etc., that will bolster those capacities within ourselves. If we see charity being exercised, if we see good humor, if we see forgiveness on display, again, it will lend support to those sides of ourselves. And we need to take care what we\u2019re exposing ourselves to because too much exposure to the opposite of love makes us into very hostile and angry people. Yes. And I think it\u2019s also such an important thing to bear in mind that the import of our conduct, moment to moment, that that is having effects that we can\u2019t see. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re far more sensitive than we allow for. And we need to build a world that recognizes that if somebody goes \u201Cmm-hmm\u201D rather than \u201Cthis\u201D or \u201Cthanks\u201D rather than \u201Cyes\u201D or whatever it is, this can ruin our day. And we should think about that as we approach, not just our personal relationships, but also our social and political relationships. These things are humiliating \u2014 little things can deeply wound and humiliate. Let\u2019s not forget that one of the things that makes relationships so scary is we need to be weak in front of other people. And most of us are just experts at being pretty strong. We\u2019ve been doing it for years. We know how to be strong. What we don\u2019t know how to do is to make ourselves safely vulnerable, and so we get we tend to get very twitchy, preternaturally aggressive, etc., when we\u2019re asked to \u2014 when the moment has come to be weak. And I feel like there\u2019s almost this calling now because the stakes are so high for emotional intelligence in public, which of course, we don\u2019t \u2014 none of us gets perfectly in our intimate lives. But we do know these things about people we love, and they\u2019re also true of people we don\u2019t know and don\u2019t think we love. But I want to return a little bit to love and sex and eros and all of this. I have to say one thing I really love and appreciate and learned from in your writing is your reflection on flirting as an art, the art of flirting, that it can be something edifying, a pleasurable gift. And you have this phrase, a \u201Cgood flirt.\u201D So would you describe what a \u201Cgood flirt\u201D is? Well, if you think about what flirtation is, in many ways, flirtation is the attempt to awaken somebody else to their attractiveness. I think it would be such a pity if we had to drive something as important as validation and self-acceptance and a pleasant view of oneself through the gate of \u2014 rather narrow gate of sex. And flirtation is kind of an act of the imagination. And what\u2019s fun about flirtation is that it often happens between really quite unlikely people. Two people meet, and maybe they\u2019re both with someone, or there\u2019s a difference in status or background, etc., and they can find that they\u2019re in a little conversation about the weather, and both parties will realize that there\u2019s something a little bit flirtatious going on. And it\u2019s got really nothing to do with sex as such. It\u2019s just two people delighting in awakening one another. It\u2019s pleasant. Right. To the fact that they\u2019re quite nice people, and they\u2019re quite attractive, and that that\u2019s OK. Yeah. I think somewhere \u2014 you also have this lovely film, one of these School of Life films about this. Here\u2019s a \u201Cgood flirt.\u201D You can make these assumptions that this other person maybe would love to sleep with us, won\u2019t sleep with us, and the reason why they won\u2019t has nothing to do with any deficiency on our part. But it\u2019s also not, as you say, a deception; it\u2019s a natural, pleasurable human experience. That\u2019s right. The other thing that we get quite wrong in our culture is the whole business of what sex actually is, because we\u2019ve come from a Freudian world. Freud has told us that there\u2019s a lot more going on in sex than we want to believe, and that a lot of it is quite weird and darker than we\u2019d ever want to imagine, and that sex is everywhere in life, even in places where we don\u2019t think it is or perhaps should be. But in a way, I\u2019ve got a sort of different view of this. I think that it\u2019s not so much that sex is everywhere; it\u2019s that psychological dynamics are everywhere, even in sex. And so often, we think of sex as just a sort of pneumatic activity, but really, it\u2019s a psychological activity. And if you try to imagine why people are excited by sex, it\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s a pleasurable nerve-ending business; it\u2019s ultimately that it\u2019s about acceptance. If you think about \u2014 why is it exciting to kiss someone for the first time? It\u2019s probably more fun eating an oyster or flossing your teeth or watching T.V. than kissing. It\u2019s a bit weird. What\u2019s this odd thing we call kissing? It\u2019s like we\u2019re trying to inflate somebody else\u2019s mouth. And it\u2019s just odd. Nevertheless, we like it. Not because of its physical feeling, but because of what it means, the meaning we infuse. And the meaning we infuse into it is, \u201CI accept you. And I accept you in a way that is incredibly intimate and that would be quite revolting with anyone else. I\u2019m allowing you into my private space as a way of signaling, \u2018I like you.\u2019\u201D And what really \u2014 we call it getting \u201Cturned on,\u201D but what we\u2019re really, as it were, excited by is that someone accepts us with remarkable \u2014 in all our\u2026 Takes delight in us. Right. Takes delight in us. And that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about it. In other words, sex is continuous with a lot of things that we\u2019re interested in outside of the bedroom. And you say that flirting is one way to experience, in the course of ordinary life, in a way that\u2019s completely nonthreatening to whatever your commitments are, what is enjoyable about sex that\u2019s not necessarily the act itself, the fact that we are sexual beings. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. But we feel often conflicted about it. I shouldn\u2019t be flirting. I can\u2019t flirt, etc. So there\u2019s a lot of fear of \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of fear of slippery slopes. In many situations, we can hang on on the slippery slope. It\u2019s OK. We\u2019ve got tools to hang on in there. Yeah. I want to know \u2014 I don\u2019t want to let you go before asking what you think about \u2014 what\u2019s your view of online dating because this a new way that so many people, perhaps most people, moving forward are meeting, are engaging this romantic side of themselves. At one level, online dating promises to open up something absolutely wonderful, which is a more logical way of getting together with someone. The sort of dream is that the secrets of our soul and the secrets of somebody else\u2019s soul will be sort of downloaded onto a computer and that we will find the best possible match for who we are. The darker side of online dating is that it encourages the idea that a good relationship must mean a conflict-free relationship, and therefore, any relationship which has conflict in it, which has unhappiness and areas of tension in it, is wrong and can be terminated because we have this wonderful backup, which is alternatives. So, like any tool, it\u2019s got its pluses and minuses and has to be used correctly. And I think \u2014 what I mean by \u201Ccorrectly\u201D is it has to broaden the pool of people from which we\u2019re choosing our lovers while not giving us the illusion that there is such a thing as a perfect human being. Right. So then you\u2019re back to the basic truth, the darker truth about love. Also, that what online dating does is it introduces you to people, but then really, the whole thrust of your thinking is \u2014 that loving is really what comes next. That\u2019s what comes after the meeting. That\u2019s right. Silicon Valley has been incredibly interested in getting us to that first stage of meeting the person. And that\u2019s great, but the next stage has been abandoned. Where is the app that will tell you how to read, how to interpret somebody else\u2019s confused signals of distress, or that will remind you at a certain point to look charitably upon someone\u2019s behavior because you remember their childhood, etc? So we have a long way to go. Our technology is still \u2014 look, we\u2019re still \u2014 it sounds odd because we \u2014 it\u2019s one of the sort of narcissisms of our time that we think we\u2019re living late on in the history of the world. We think we\u2019re sort of \u2014 we\u2019re late comers to the party. We\u2019re still at the very beginning of understanding ourselves as human emotional creatures. We\u2019re still taking our first baby steps in the understanding of love, and we need a lot of compassion for ourselves. And no wonder we make horrific mistakes pretty much all the time. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a conversation about love with writer and philosopher Alain de Botton. I happened to see your tweet at the end of 2016 when The New York Times released its most-read articles of the year. And your \u201CWhy You\u2019ll Marry the Wrong Person\u201D was number 1, which is really extraordinary, the most-read article in a year of the Brexit vote, the presidential election, war, refugee crisis. I wonder what that tells you about us as a species. Look, it was deeply fascinating and quite extraordinary. And apparently, it was first by a long way. It\u2019s just peculiar. And I think that \u2014 look, first of all, it tells us that we have an enormous loneliness around our difficulties. One could write a follow-on piece \u2014 I may or may not \u2014 called \u201CWhy You\u2019ll Get Into the Wrong Job,\u201D which would probably score quite highly too, and \u201CWhy You\u2019ll Have the Wrong Child,\u201D and \u201CWhy You\u2019ll Go on the Wrong Vacation,\u201D and \u201CWhy Your Body Will Be the Wrong Shape,\u201D and \u201CWhy You\u2019ll Think You Live in the Wrong Country,\u201D etc. And in a way, we need solace for the sense that we have gone wrong in an area, whatever it may be, where perfection was possible. And anyone who comes along and says, \u201CYou know, it\u2019s normal that you are suffering. Life is suffering,\u201D is doing a quite unusual thing in our culture, which is so much about optimism. It sounds grim. It is, in fact, enormously consoling, and alleviating, and helpful in a culture which is oppressive in its demands for perfection. So I think a certain kind of pessimistic realism, which is totally compatible with hope, totally compatible with laughter, good humor, a sense of fun \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be dour. It\u2019s how comedy and tragedy belong together. Right. Exactly. I\u2019m a great fan of gallows humor. We\u2019re all on our way to the gallows in one way or another, and we can hug and give each other laughs and point out the more pleasant sides as we head towards the scaffold. That may be your last word. I just want to ask you \u2014 when we first began to speak about On Love, which you wrote \u2014 which was published when you were 23 in the late \u201890s. You\u2019ve now been married for over a dozen years. What did you really not know? And that book was so wise. And in fact, that book that you published when you were 23, On Love, really presented a lot of the themes you\u2019ve carried forward in time. But I do wonder what you really did not know, what you\u2019ve learned, what you continue to learn about love at this stage in your life. I genuinely thought at that time that problems in love are the result of being with people who are, in one way or another, defective. And in 2002, this belief was severely tested in that I met someone who was really absolutely wonderful in every way. And through much effort, I pursued her and eventually married her and discovered something very surprising. She was great in a million ways. She was very right. And yet, oddly, there were all sorts of problems. And I think it\u2019s been the path that I\u2019ve been on to realize that those problems had nothing to do with her being a deficient person or indeed with me being a horribly deficient person. They were to do with the challenges of being a human being trying to relate to another human being in a loving relationship, that I was encountering some endemic issues that every couple, however well-matched \u2014 and there is no such thing as a perfect match \u2014 but however well-matched, every couple will encounter these problems, that love is something we have to learn, and we can make progress with, and that it\u2019s not just an enthusiasm; it\u2019s a skill. And it requires forbearance, generosity, imagination, and a million things besides. And we must fiercely resist the idea that true love must mean conflict-free love, that the course of true love is smooth. It\u2019s not. The course of true love is rocky and bumpy at the best of times. That\u2019s the best we can manage as the creatures we are, that flawed humanity, the better chance we\u2019ll have of doing the true hard work of love. Alain de Botton is the founder and chairman of The School of Life. His books include Religion for Atheists, How Proust Can Change Your Life, and the novel\u00A0The Course of Love. Love takes many forms, and there\u2019s more love in our lives than we often realize. We\u2019ve teamed up with some incredible artists at Bear Fox Chalk to craft beautiful hand-illustrated postcards, each with a quote evoking one of the four types of love \u2014 friendship, romance, compassion, or lovingkindness towards a neighbor or stranger or oneself. Head over to onbeing.org and fill in a little about a person you care about. We\u2019ll mail them a hand-designed quote card in your name. We\u2019re calling this celebration #FourKindsOfLove. So join us in celebrating love in its many shapes."
