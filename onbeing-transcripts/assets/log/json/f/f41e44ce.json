  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CBeing Autistic and Being Human.\u201D My guests, Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins, a painter and a literary historian, have grappled with autism since the diagnosis of their son, Morgan, in 2002. We\u2019ll step back from controversies over autism causes and cures and explore the mystery and meaning of autism in their family and in history and society. As Paul Collins and Jennifer Elder have discovered, autism is a spectrum that sheds light on human nature, intelligence, and accomplishment. I think that cuts right to the heart of both of our works, that there\u2019s a spectrum, and that we see the world in a completely different way now. You know, it\u2019s not just Morgan. We now see these traits running through our family and through society. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. One child in every 110 in the U.S. is now diagnosed to be somewhere on the spectrum of autism. This hour, we\u2019ll step back from public controversies over autism causes and cures. We\u2019ll explore the mystery and meaning of autism in one family\u2019s life and in history and society. Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins say that life with their child with autism has deepened their understanding of human nature, of disability, and of creativity, intelligence, and accomplishment. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CBeing Autistic and Being Human.\u201D The term autism comes from the Greek word for self \u2014 autos \u2014 a condition in which a person seems quite literally to live in his or her own world. Two physicians described autism and gave it the same name nearly simultaneously in the mid 1940s, though they were an ocean apart. One of them was the Austrian Hans Asperger for whom a form of high-functioning autism, Asperger\u2019s syndrome, is named. After their son, Morgan, was diagnosed, Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins found a vivid history of autism before it was identified as a unique condition. I spoke with them in 2007. Jennifer, an artist, has authored two books for children and families. Paul, a literary historian, pursued the story of Dr. Asperger and other pioneers, as well as figures like Peter the Wild Boy, a probable case of autism. This child, found living alone in a forest, was studied as the philosophers and scientists of the 18th century reflected on what it means to be human. As Paul Collins puts it, autism entails both disability and ability. Isolating difficulties with human relationship, for example, can be the flip side of a fierce aptitude for logic and a capacity for intense independent focus. These personality traits run through families and society and underpin fields like engineering, art, and science. A doctor first suggested that Paul Collins and Jennifer Elder\u2019s son, Morgan, might have autism when he was two and a half, at a routine checkup. Until then, his normal was normal to them. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CDesmond Tutu\u2019s God of Surprises.\u201D We really had no basis of comparison because, for one thing, we\u2019d been moving around a lot. So we didn\u2019t have a situation where we could watch someone else\u2019s child developing over the course of several years and actually notice that the \u2014 sort of the milestones were progressing really differently for other people\u2019s kids. But, you know, we used to notice that what we just thought was his unique personality, like when he was a baby \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 we used to joke that he was inscrutable, because he would just look at you for a long time without sort of smiling or laughing. And, but we didn\u2019t know that was anything strange about it. But I also, I mean toddlers are kind of strange, eccentric beings and inscrutable in a way. And, you know, you also knew that he was smart. And you knew that he was happy. That was one thing that, yeah, that really threw me off actually was that he, what he had what\u2019s known as cognitive scatter, which is that some of his abilities were quite advanced for his age, or at least progressing, you know, quite typically, and others had barely progressed at all. And, you know, you usually think of developmental delays in a child as being kind of an all-around thing. Yeah. And so when I saw that some abilities were really coming along, I just assumed, \u201CWell, you know, he\u2019s a late talker.\u201D Yeah. \u201C\u2026 But, you know, he\u2019s doing so well in all these other things, so things must be going fine.\u201D And not realizing, of course, that that\u2019s really one of the almost defining characteristics with autism that some abilities can actually become quite advanced. Right. And I guess what I\u2019m learning and I think you described on so many levels is, it\u2019s not one thing, autism, right? It\u2019s a spectrum of human character and behavior. So you still have to get to know your child and what it means that your child has this diagnosis. And I think that cuts right to the heart of both of our works, that there\u2019s a spectrum, and that we see the world in a completely different way now. You know, it\u2019s not just Morgan. We now see these traits running through our family and through society. Mm-hmm. That was something that really was kind of a turning point for me, too, which was that, you know, I think initially when we had the doctors saying, \u201CWell, you need to have him looked at for developmental delays,\u201D it seemed like something had happened to our child. Right. You know, we had brought him in and he was fine. And then we brought him out of the office and he was not. And it was just very mystifying. And over time, what I came to see was that, yeah, not only is there a broad spectrum of autistic behavior, but, yeah, that because these traits actually run through families, and not in the form of full-blown autism necessarily, but you can see some of the traits very commonly, particularly in male relatives. When I first heard about that and started looking around at my own family, it really transformed my understanding of my family. And, in some ways, people like my brother and my father started to make a lot more sense. And I think that it was the same for Jennifer with her family, as well. Well, let\u2019s talk about that. That\u2019s one of the things you write about in the book, that you discovered that, in fact, there is data. There are studies about, not just traits of autism, but professions, right? Engineers and artists and scientists tend to be in families where autism turns up. Yeah. There\u2019s been really fascinating research on this done by Simon Baron-Cohen at Cambridge University. And what he noticed essentially was that there seemed to be a lot of autistic siblings, in particular, of students of his who were in science-related majors and, you know, math students as well, and engineering students, and that kind of thing. And so initially, he simply looked at, just sort of did an informal study comparing English majors and the rates of autism in their families with a number of science majors. And the science majors that he was looking at had rates that were like five and six times that of autism in their families. Interestingly enough, the English majors had much, much higher rates of manic depression in their families. Oh, gosh. Which is suddenly all makes sense. So, and then when he expanded to studying the broader population, he found that this held up. That actually, when you looked at the professions that family members of people with autism were in, they tended to be in things like accounting, engineering, computer programming, and had very low rates of employment in fields like sales, for instance \u2026 OK. \u2026 which is all about social contact. Right. One way you described this as \u201Csolitary professions requiring deep focus and abstraction,\u201D which also includes artists in that category. Yeah. And there\u2019s actually, musicians were very highly represented in particular, but also visual artists among these families that he was looking at. And the interesting thing about that for me is the first reaction a lot of people have when they hear his research is they\u2019ll say, \u201CWell, sure, my dad\u2019s an engineer.\u201D I mean, in my case, my dad is an engineer. OK. And my brother is finishing a Ph.D. in computer science. And so the reaction you have is, well, there\u2019s a little bit of shock initially, because he\u2019s right. He pegged their professions pretty well. Right. But at the same time, you think, \u201CWell, but they\u2019re not actually autistic.\u201D Yeah. And that\u2019s sort of his point, really, is that these traits in a much less highly expressed form or less over-expressed form, I guess you could say, naturally make people much better fitted for these professions. Yeah. And, I mean, you also, among your adventures, Paul, you went to Microsoft. Strangely enough, it was actually for my first book that it had come out the year before at that point, called Banvard\u2019s Folly, which was a book about sort of failed or forgotten inventors and artists. And so they brought me up to just do a discussion with their employees. And in the middle of all this, as they were inviting me up, all this started happening with Morgan, with his diagnosis. And so I asked them, \u201CWell, you know, while I\u2019m up there, do you happen to have anyone working on autism-related issues?\u201D Because I had heard rather a lot of whisperings among people that there was a fairly major autism community \u2026 Right. \u2026 in a lot of computing companies. And they said, \u201CWell, yes. We certainly do have a lot going on here in that regard. \u201CFor me, the strangest moment there, I was speaking I think primarily with the, what they described as the math wing of Microsoft. So they had a lot of people doing sort of theoretical mathematical work and working the algorithms and things like that. And I was addressing this room and all these people were working on their laptops as I was talking, even before I started talking. And so they were looking at the laptops rather than at you while you were speaking? Mm-hmm. Yeah, for the entire speech. And at first, I thought, \u201CWow, these are really busy people.\u201D Right. And, but then I realized from some of the questions that they were then asking that they were, in fact, listening to me. And afterwards, I mentioned it to someone. And they said, \u201CWell, they were watching the webcast of you.\u201D I was like, 15 feet away from some of these people. And she said, \u201CWell, that\u2019s just how they prefer to interact.\u201D But, you know, I think, at one level, when you see something like that, you go, \u201CThat\u2019s kind of strange.\u201D But at the same time, I think it\u2019s also really great that we live in an age where people who may, you know, I think in the past probably wouldn\u2019t have gone to a lecture like that at all just because of all the social contact that it would\u2019ve entailed, that in the past, it would\u2019ve been just much too uncomfortable or, you know, kind of painful for them to deal with. Mm-hmm. And, I mean, again, the point you\u2019ve been making is that it is that very same personality-type set of skills that enables them to do this work somehow. The way that Simon Baron-Cohen described it to me was he said, \u201CAll these professions I look at have a systematizing tendency.\u201D You know, they\u2019re seeking an internal logic within a system. And that lends itself beautifully to fields like mathematics or computing, which, in a lot of ways, is basically a subset of math. Right. And \u2014 you know, at the same time, it makes it extraordinarily difficult for them to deal with the highly illogical world of people. Yes. You can read a moving essay by the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould about his son with autism at speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, today exploring autism in one family\u2019s life and in human history and society with Paul Collins and Jennifer Elder. Their first son, Morgan, has autism. Jennifer\u2019s most recent book, Autistic Planet, evokes a world that imaginatively incorporates some of the motor and sensory traits that can make people with autism say they feel alien in human society. These include rocking, hand-flapping, and extreme sensitivity to sound, touch, and texture. Paul took the title of his book about autism, Not Even Wrong, from a criticism the physicist Wolfgang Pauli used to make of his colleagues. He would suggest that their way of thinking and seeing something was so far off the mark as to be not even wrong. One of the classic characteristics of autism is what researchers call a lack of a theory of mind, an incomplete understanding that other people don\u2019t know what they know, don\u2019t want what they want. Therefore, Paul Collins points out, words like \u201Cbelieve\u201D and \u201Cthink\u201D and \u201Cknow\u201D do not mean the same thing in an autistic vocabulary. Morgan, I think, like any autistic person, really interacts a lot with the outside world. In fact, most of his speech consists of either of demands from the outside world, you know, versus asking for things in a very instrumental way \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 or of repeating things that he hears, which is a really common tendency that\u2019s known as echolalia that, you know, lines from books or things from songs or things on TV. In a way, his mind is kind of filled with all these cultural artifacts that kind of replays over and over again. So he\u2019s actually, in his own way, he\u2019s really fascinated with the outside world. And he interacts with us. There are times that he really wants us to be sitting with him or to explain something. But it\u2019s entirely on his own terms, you know? When he doesn\u2019t feel like interacting, he simply won\u2019t respond. And you know, you don\u2019t expect that from people, normally. You expect people to at least take a polite interest when you approach them about whatever. Right. And for him, it\u2019s really, you know, either he wants to interact or he doesn\u2019t. And there\u2019s kind of no in-between. You know, I\u2019ve often explained it to people who weren\u2019t familiar with an autistic child that it\u2019s like somebody watching a video and you\u2019re trying to get their attention. But at the worst, they don\u2019t hear you at all or at best you\u2019re sort of bugging them and they try to swat you away. Right. And that\u2019s what Morgan\u2019s like all the time. He\u2019s got, sort of a video running in his head. And you really have to get up in there to get his attention. The funny thing, too, is that I\u2019m kind of like that. Yes. Well, again, there\u2019s that spectrum, isn\u2019t there? Yes. And, I mean, that was one of the really strange moments for me, particularly when I saw Baron-Cohen\u2019s work, was recognizing these traits within myself. And that \u2026 Like what? I mean, give me an example. When I\u2019m focused on an object or a project or whatever, it has the effect for me of almost as if I\u2019m turning my ears off. I just don\u2019t hear what\u2019s going on around me. And the ironic thing for me is that I can\u2019t imagine having a career as a historian without having that tendency, you know? Right. Because I\u2019m able to go into archives for hours at a time and just focus. And it\u2019s like diving underwater or something. I just don\u2019t even hear the outside world. And we think this might be part of the connection between autism and what you might call genius, is the ability to focus on something, you know? Single-mindedness, yeah. Absolutely. Because in order to come to a conclusion, you may have to think about something without, you know, without your mind wandering for, you know, a terribly long period of time. And Paul can do that. But, of course, when I want to get his attention for a minor matter \u2026 Yes. \u2026 it can be difficult. Right. It\u2019s almost like having to shake me awake or something when I\u2019m working on something. And, and so, I think, you know, what Morgan experiences is a much higher degree of that, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s, I think, helped me a lot in working with him. That I don\u2019t take it personally that he\u2019s somehow ignoring me or something. Yeah. I actually understand. When you described Morgan, again, as a toddler, he also had this not uncommon, he had these abilities, right? He knew things. I remember this, there\u2019s a scene in the book where you had somebody testing him and he was running by saying, \u201CIsosceles triangle, rhombus,\u201D right? He\u2019s going through a geometry phase or something. But I wrote in my margins of the book, when I read that, you know, \u201CWhere does this come from?\u201D I mean, there\u2019s, there\u2019s some real mystery in this, isn\u2019t it? I mean, across that spectrum, as you\u2019re talking about. You know, one of the most curious things to watch, really, with Morgan has been, you know, as parents, we can create an environment for him. We try to encourage certain things or just try to provide a rich environment for him to learn in. But he\u2019s very self-motivated in terms of what he decides he wants to pay attention to and what he finds interesting. And if he finds something interesting, he just has this incredible focus upon it, and will develop so quickly. And I think that\u2019s very common in terms of autistic spectrum-kind of behavior that, you know, Asperger described, you know, people who could do advanced mathematics, among the children of his, who were patients. But if you ask them what their name was, they couldn\u2019t tell you. They didn\u2019t even know now how to respond. And, I mean, it\u2019s sort of an extreme form of it, in a way. But it\u2019s, that really almost epitomizes that, that condition that if there is something that captures their focus, it becomes an immensely powerful tool, in many cases, you know, particularly if one is interested in the sciences or the arts or whatever. But one of the strange things about autism is that it\u2019s very difficult to harness that, you know. Right. I mean, you can try to put things in front of a child and, in the hope that, well, maybe they\u2019ll be really interested in this, and that will be a constructive thing and, you know, perhaps it will be good for them in terms of learning a profession or having a hobby or whatever. But it\u2019s almost impossible to be able to guess what it will be that captures that focus, because they\u2019re really not interested in your judgment of what\u2019s important and what isn\u2019t. Right. But, you know, the same thing is true of any child, you know? I mean, we don\u2019t \u2026 Yeah. None of us knows what is going to grab our children\u2019s attention or where their talents will be. Morgan is passionate about musical instruments, but he\u2019s equally as passionate about YouTube videos, you know? Right. It\u2019s something that seems very trivial to us and just as important as the symphony orchestra to Morgan. I see. And specifically, he\u2019s become fascinated by the, was it the bumpers or whatever, the \u2026 Logos? The logos that film production companies run right before a movie or a TV show starts, like the whole Paramount mountain logo and things like that. Really? Or the Universal opening that shows the revolving planet. And there\u2019s a whole community of people that are fascinated. People will put \u2026 There are hundreds of these posted on YouTube. And \u2026 Yeah. People compile, like histories of them into videos. And they\u2019re passionate about it. And they rework them. They make their own versions on their computers, and parodies. And we had no idea. You know, it\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t usually think that Morgan has any social influences, but he actually picked this up from another boy at school who happened to be watching these YouTube videos one day. Another autistic boy. Another autistic child, yeah. Artist and author Jennifer Elder and literary historian Paul Collins, parents of Morgan, who has autism. Temple Grandin is perhaps the best-known person with autism in the world today. She\u2019s written several books and won wide acclaim for her work to create humane slaughterhouses. The neurologist Oliver Sacks drew the title of his 1995 book, An Anthropologist on Mars, from his profile of Temple Grandin. As Grandin puts it, she \u201Cthinks in pictures.\u201D Here\u2019s part of a reflection she offered on her approach to ethics and meaning for our colleagues at NPR\u2019s This I Believe. Because I have autism, I live by concrete rules instead of abstract beliefs. And because I have autism, I think in pictures and sounds. I don\u2019t have the ability to process abstract thought the way that you do. Here\u2019s how my brain works: It\u2019s like the search engine Google for images. If you say the word \u201Clove\u201D to me, I\u2019ll surf the Internet inside my brain. Then, a series of images pops into my head. What I\u2019ll see, for example, is a picture of a mother horse with a foal, or I think of Herbie the Love Bug, scenes from the movie Love Story, or the Beatles song \u201CLove, love, all you need is love.\u201D When I was a child, my parents taught me the difference between good and bad behavior by showing me specific examples. My mother told me that you don\u2019t hit other kids because you would not like it if they hit you. That makes sense. But if my mother told me to be nice to someone, it was too vague for me to comprehend, but if she said that being nice meant delivering daffodils to the next-door neighbor, that I could understand. I built a library of experiences that I could refer to when I was in a new situation. That way, when I confronted something unfamiliar, I could draw on the information in my homemade library and come up with an appropriate way to behave in a new and strange situation. Temple Grandin compares her brain to a Google search engine, and the Internet has fostered valuable online communities for people with autism.

After a short break, more conversation with Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins, including how life with their son with autism makes them think fundamentally differently about what it means to be human. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CBeing Autistic and Being Human.\u201D My guests, Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins, are a painter and a literary historian and their first son, Morgan, has autism. In art and writing, they\u2019ve also explored autism in historical, medical, and social perspective. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in 110 children in the U.S. falls on the spectrum of autism. This ranges from severe impairment to the high-functioning personality known by some as Asperger\u2019s syndrome. And somewhere above 10 percent of people across the spectrum of autism exhibit extraordinary skills or talents, often mathematical or artistic in nature. But they may be hindered from applying those productively because of interactive deficits, compulsive motor traits, and sensory sensitivities that also mark their lives. This is a recording of the pianist Glenn Gould. Gould hated the sound of clapping and being watched, dressing up for concerts, and shaking hands. He gave up public concerts at the age of 32 and recorded his most famous music alone in a recording studio, often humming unselfconsciously while he played. This 1955 rendition of Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations is one of the best-selling classical albums of all time. Again, Jennifer Elder and Paul Collins. I think, for me, one of the most curious things to watch with Morgan has particularly been his interest in music, because there seemed to be things with music that he just naturally seems to understand. I\u2019m fairly sure he has perfect pitch. And that\u2019s quite common, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. That turns up a lot with autistic children. Right. And he\u2019ll just pick up tunes by ear and play them on the piano, and that kind of thing that, for example, there are few things that are almost as soon as you hear about it, you just go, that again. And one of them is the, you know, perfect pitch or the ability to pick up things on the piano, like that. Another thing is a fascination, for example, with mass transit systems. A lot, a lot of autistic kids are fascinated by bus schedules and bus numbers and railways. And they memorize them, don\u2019t they? Yeah. They memorize a lot of stuff. There\u2019s actually a tremendous fascination with Thomas the Tank Engine among a lot of autistic kids. And I think it\u2019s because there\u2019s a whole little self-contained universe of this island and all these named engines. And the other thing is too, this occurred to me recently, if you\u2019ve ever seen Thomas the Tank Engine, the trains have faces on them. But they\u2019re not terribly expressive. There\u2019s only, you know, they don\u2019t have hundreds of facial muscles \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026the way humans do. They only have a few expressions. And so for, I think, for an autistic child, it\u2019s much easier to interpret the train than it is to interpret people. I remember somebody commenting one time that there are a lot of autistic children who were big fans of Japanese animation or anime. And one of the \u2026 Oh. Right. \u2026 reasons they thought was because in the \u2014 these animations, the expressions of emotion are so strong and clear cut, you know. Stark. Yes. There\u2019s not a lot of nuance. They have wild hair and outfits. But their mouths and their eyes are \u2026 Yeah. Yeah. If they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re either furious or afraid or, you know. And it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s not a lot of in-between. So autistic kids can watch it fairly comfortably knowing what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s no sort of \u2014 there\u2019s nothing subtle to pick up on. Mm-hmm. I have also read somewhere that many autistic children are \u2014 feel a kind of affinity with characters like Dr. Spock in Star Trek or \u2014 I wondered about Commander Data is one of my heroes \u2026 Absolutely. Yes. \u2026 in Star Trek: The Next Generation. And, I mean, is that true of Morgan or other autistic children you know? He\u2019s a little young for science fiction. OK. But absolutely. The fact that you say that you\u2019re a Data fan makes me think you might be one of us, Krista. I know. I know, I know, it made me wonder too. Because \u2014 and there is in those characters, in Spock and Data, the brilliance and the kind of perplexity at \u2014 and in fact, how strange and complicated normal human beings are, right, with the range of emotions and interactions and what a mess that is sometimes. I think, I mean, particularly when you have a character, like Spock, who\u2019s supposed to be sort of, of both worlds. Yes. You know, he has one foot in the human world, and the other one isn\u2019t. And he\u2019s trying to figure it out and trying to somehow reconcile this. And, yeah, that\u2019s one of the reasons that a lot of autistic people find him to be such a \u2014 sort of a sympathetic character, because his situation kind of mirrors their own. They are very much part of our world and, you know, draw from it and actually help make a lot of the things in our world as well. And yet, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to them. And particularly the social interactions are just \u2014 there is so much to social interactions that can\u2019t really be explained very logically. You just have to intuit them. And when you actually try to sit down and explain it to someone, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. Here\u2019s a scene with Spock that takes place around a campfire from the Star Trek movie The Final Frontier. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the sing-along. That\u2019s great. I haven\u2019t sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? (singing) Row, row, row your boat. Row, row, row your boat. I love row \u2014 do you know row, row, row, row, row your boat? That song did not come up in my research, Captain. The lyrics are very simple. The doctor and I will start it off. And then when we give you a signal, you jump in. Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. singing] Merrily, merrily, merrily lightly down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily life is but \u2014 merrily, merrily, merrily life \u2014 come on, Spock. Why didn\u2019t you jump in? I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words. It\u2019s a song, you green-blooded Vulcan. You sing it. The words aren\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that you have a good time singing it. Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. Were we having a good time? I\u2019ve had several conversations over the years about children as little philosophers and little theologians, you know, that in childhood, we start asking these great existential questions \u2014 Where did we come from? Is there a god? If there\u2019s a god, who made god? \u2014 you know? And also ethical questions like, why do people hurt each other? And I wondered, do you experience those kinds of questions, that kind of side to Morgan? Now, I\u2019m not sure how abstractly he thinks about these things. You know, my feeling \u2014 and I won\u2019t speak for Paul since we have different feelings on this \u2014 but I feel that we all come into this world with a sort of immediate natural relationship with God. And so that for Morgan, he has that, you know, that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s always been for him. He has that relationship and it\u2019s unaffected by whatever society has to say about it. But I think that we have to introduce ideas of ethics to him, because this sort of thing just simply doesn\u2019t occur to him. He\u2019s certainly not cruel. Right. But getting back to the theory of mind, he just doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about what other people are experiencing. Right. So I suppose if he\u2019s not \u2014 he can\u2019t really \u2014 he\u2019s perplexed by other people\u2019s reactions. Then I suppose, part of being kind or compassionate is about \u2014 would be such a complicated interaction, kind of beyond the way he \u2014 the way he \u2014 his mind works. Absolutely. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible for him. I just think that it needs to be taught, because it doesn\u2019t come to him immediately the way it might come to us. And one thing we\u2019ve actually had to teach Morgan with his little brother is how to comfort his little brother. And we\u2019re still at the stage where we have to remind him that, you know, if something happens and Bramwell gets upset or if, you know, he falls down and skins his knee, or that kind of thing, that the appropriate thing to do is to ask if he\u2019s OK, or to, you know, to give him a hug or something like that. And otherwise, it doesn\u2019t really occur to him. And not, yeah, not out of any sort of cruel or \u2026 Right. \u2026 or callous sense of, but just that \u2014 I think it really doesn\u2019t occur to him. And that issue of empathy is a very difficult one, I think, for a lot of autistic people, because I think for those particularly not familiar with them, it may seem kind of pointedly callous, when in fact it\u2019s, I think, it kind of comes down to a lack of understanding of the situation a lot of the time. And they don\u2019t see the point in it. So, I mean, Jennifer, when you say that you believe that he \u2014 that we all come into the world with a relationship with God, but with Morgan, is that just more something that you intuit? I suppose, because he doesn\u2019t talk about things the way non-autistic people talk about things. Is that what you\u2019re saying? It\u2019s just something you believe? Yes. Absolutely. That\u2019s right. And, you know, he doesn\u2019t speak very abstractly about anything. And the sort of window into his soul that we have is usually through a sort of a code that\u2019s based on the books and videos that he consumes. So he often somehow puts together phrases and characters from books to express something. And of course, nothing\u2019s coming to mind right now as I say that. But, you know, he will express something by way of mentioning, \u201CThe Cat in the Hat feels sad.\u201D Oh. OK. Or that sort of thing. And that\u2019s how he lets us know that he\u2019s thinking about somebody being sad. So we understand that when he\u2019s putting together these, to other people, meaningless expressions that they are his way of interpreting the world, which he does primarily through literature. Because he doesn\u2019t pick up on scenes in person, you know? He picks up through scenes in books and videos what human interactions are about. I think that human interactions are much too fleeting for him to have a chance to interpret them. Whereas he\u2019ll read a book over and over again, or watch a scene in a video over and over again and can really try to figure it out. Or at least, kind of memorize it as almost a kind of a script for dealing with the world in a way that, yeah, that \u2014 in-person interactions, they\u2019re not repeatable in a consistent manner for him. So it\u2019s very difficult for him to figure them out. Kind of makes you think that 21st century is not a bad time to be born as an autistic person with all this rich world of media that we have. Absolutely. Oh, yeah. I have no idea what autistic people \u2014 how they spent their time before the computer. Artist and author Jennifer Elder and literary historian Paul Collins, parents of Morgan, who has autism. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CBeing Autistic and Being Human.\u201D Until recent decades, autism was conflated with very different conditions such as schizophrenia and Down syndrome. Popular theories about autism blamed childhood trauma or bad mothering. Genetic research and brain studies may now gradually unravel the mystery of what causes or triggers autism and how it is related to the same familial and societal traits that give rise to art and science and logic. Jennifer Elder\u2019s book Different Like Me: My Book of Autism Heroes describes historical figures of great achievement, who she and others believe might have been somewhere on the spectrum of autism. Among them are the scientist Isaac Newton, the primatologist Dian Fossey, the comedian Andy Kaufman, and the artist Andy Warhol. In his book Not Even Wrong, Paul Collins writes this: \u201CAutists are described by others \u2014 and by themselves \u2014 as aliens among humans. But there\u2019s an irony to this, for precisely the opposite is true. They are us, and to understand them is to begin to understand what it means to be human. Think of it: a disability is usually defined in terms of what is missing. \u2026 But autism \u2026 is as much about what is abundant as what is missing, an overexpression of the very traits that make our species unique. Other animals are social, but only humans are capable of abstract logic. The autistic outhuman the humans, and we can scarcely recognize the result.\u201D Jennifer, you also have this book Different Like Me: My Book of Autism Heroes, and it includes, you know, people like Albert Einstein and female mathematicians I\u2019ve never heard of, and the first \u2014 was it the first African-American scientist and \u2026 Yes. And I had never heard of most of these people. Yeah. I mean, some of them, I mean Temple Grandin is in there. And there are those amazing stories in this category of savants, which is associated with autism, and that is so fascinating. And, you know \u2014 but then, what I also know is that all autistic children are not gifted. And there\u2019s some new research about girls in particular \u2014 autistic girls \u2014 that they have higher rates of depression and suicide and not necessarily these skill sets that autistic boys often have. And that is something that, you know, Paul and I have sort of spoken of this openly and Paul wrote about it. But Morgan does take antidepressants. And we feel like when he was first diagnosed, we resisted medicating him. And many of the other children that we knew, autistic children, were medicated. But there came a point for him after we made a move across country where he just became very distressed and couldn\u2019t function and \u2026 And actually been kind of building up for a while as he got older. He became more and more sensitive to things that frustrated him in the outside world and more and more overstimulated by them, and really didn\u2019t know how to handle them, and would get very upset about it. And the move really brought that to a head. And so, at that point, it actually wasn\u2019t a difficult decision, because we also had a small child, and Morgan would be thrashing around. And so there was a real physical danger at that point. Right. And he kind of became his old self, and it was sort of a remarkable thing to see. And his old self, not in the sense that it suddenly he was no longer autistic, he\u2019s, you know, very much so \u2026 Right. \u2026 but he could be sort of happy in the self that he already had been. And that\u2019s also another thing about the era that we live in that makes me feel extraordinarily fortunate. Yeah. I mean, for me, there\u2019s no question in a past era, you know, even just 20, 30 years ago probably. I mean, for one thing he might\u2019ve been institutionalized from the outset. Yeah. But certainly once he became difficult to manage physically and getting really frustrated and that kind of thing, he probably would\u2019ve been institutionalized at that point. And as it is, that\u2019s still a situation that a lot of parents find themselves brought to where they have an autistic child. Yeah. You were sort of bringing this up earlier, that not all autistic children are going be these wonderful prodigies and sort of miracle stories \u2026 Right. Composing music and solving \u2026 Right. \u2026 complex mathematical equations, and \u2014 yes. When you talked about Morgan as a toddler, you called him, you know, he was really happy and playful, right, he may not have been communicative \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 in the way some children his age were. But would you still describe him as happy and playful at eight and a half? Yeah. Generally, he\u2019s a really happy kid. And usually when frustrations come about, it\u2019s just dealing with the outside world. When he\u2019s doing his own thing, he is actually quite happy. And that\u2019s one of those things I think that\u2019s true for a lot of autistic kids. But by the same token, it\u2019s not true for some. There are some that are just in a lot of distress much of the time and have to deal a lot with issues of depression and things like that. Right. And that is one thing I\u2019m very hopeful about that, you know, autism being a condition with a very strong genetic element and one that clearly shapes your sort of neurological development from the get-go, I don\u2019t know that science is necessarily going to come along with something that will somehow reverse all of that. It seems unlikely in that sense. But I do think that we live in an age where there\u2019s much more hope that some of the more challenging or really difficult aspects of it can at least be mitigated a great deal. And, I mean, that\u2019s already the case to some extent. It makes me feel very fortunate to live in this time. Yeah. Yeah. That we\u2019re able to say, you know we have a happy, healthy autistic child, which I think is something that previous generations were \u2026 Right. \u2026 not encouraged to think of it that way. Put all those words in a sentence together. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. I was really struck by these lines, Paul, in your book, as you \u2014 I think along the lines we\u2019ve been speaking. So Isaac Newton was another person in Jennifer\u2019s book, completely single-minded person who happened to be focusing, as you say, on something other people found important. Right. And you said, \u201CThere are Newtons of refrigerator parts, and Newtons of painted light bulbs, and Newtons of train schedules, and Isaac Newton happened to be the Newton of Newtonian physics and you cannot have him without having the others too.\u201D Yeah. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s two things that brings to mind, actually. I was in Italy not too long ago. For some reason, the book has actually been really popular over there. And a journalist there asked me, \u201CWhat if we were able to do genetic screening for autism?\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, that\u2019s actually a really difficult question, because what are you prepared to lose?\u201D Yeah. And, you know, I don\u2019t know if anyone would argue necessarily against addressing issues of really profound autism and of some of the very real and profound difficulties that autistic people face. But those sorts of abilities and the traits that show up in the families around them \u2014 yeah, I don\u2019t know if you want to lose those. But the funny thing about that, too, is that it\u2019s very hard to control where that focus is going to go. Yes. I mean, how does living with Morgan and the way you\u2019ve had to think about autism \u2014 how does that change the way you think about some of these great existential questions or, you know, what it means to be human? How does it change the way you live \u2014 think about yourself? I think I\u2019ve become \u2014 I would hope, at least, much more patient and empathetic with other people when they\u2019re acting in ways that I don\u2019t understand. I think that in the past when someone seemed to be acting oddly or seemed to be sort of very socially awkward or just doing things that seems kind of unnerving or didn\u2019t make sense to me, I would think, \u201CWell, what\u2019s that guy\u2019s problem?\u201D and, you know, maybe avoid them. That\u2019s, I think, a natural reaction for anyone to have. Yes. But at the same time, when I see that now, I actually find myself asking that as a genuine question: What is that person contending with, you know? Or what is it like for that person? You know, I want to say that one thing that has come up with us is Morgan really loves the Goodwill, which is not a place that I gave much thought before he came along. The Goodwill \u2014 the store the \u2026 Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. I have to say that Portland, Oregon, has some of the finest Goodwill\u2019s I have ever experienced in my life. OK. And Morgan will ask for the Goodwill. And we love to take him there, because it\u2019s \u2014 I never would\u2019ve thought of this before Morgan, but it\u2019s a place that\u2019s very friendly to people with disabilities. And when I\u2019m there, I often see other people with developmental disabilities and people who I might not have noticed before, and now I do. Now I think about \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 you know, how to make their world as comfortable as possible. And that\u2019s just a place where they can be, you know, that\u2019s comfortable and accepting. And you really do, when you\u2019re there, you feel like you\u2019re part of a community even if you\u2019ve never seen, you know, if it\u2019s a store full of strangers to you that I \u2014 it gives me another perspective on interacting with people who might be invisible otherwise.

He edits the Collins Library for McSweeney\u2019s Books and is an assistant professor of English at Portland State University. Out of all of the conversations I\u2019ve had, this interview was one of the most difficult to edit. There was so much wide-ranging material to choose from; we had to leave out helpful stories about how Paul and Jennifer initiate contact with their son \u2014 and interesting anecdotes about famous personalities like the comedians Andy Kaufman and Sacha Baron Cohen. Here\u2019s your chance to hear what was cut to make this an hour of radio. Download the two-hour uninterrupted conversation and this produced program for free through our podcast, e-mail newsletter, or website, speakingoffaith.org. We\u2019ve also compiled a collection of writings about autism, including Paul Collins\u2019 essay about the difficult decision he made to put his son on antidepressants. He\u2019s called it the most important thing he\u2019s ever written. Find links to that essay, our staff blog, and much more \u2014 speakingoffaith.org.
