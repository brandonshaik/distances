  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. The ideals and rituals of marriage in America are infused with Biblical imagery. This hour we\u2019ll explore nuances of Biblical teachings about marriage, family, and divorce; the surprising ambiguity of the New Testament; and the striking practicality of Jewish tradition across the ages. The marriage contract talks about all the duties that the man has to his wife, not the other way around. What the Torah itself tries to do is to take an inherently unequal situation in the ancient world and to make it more equal. The real tragedy in Christian theology about marriage is that it has tended to look only at the sacred texts and has tended to ignore the experience of actual married people. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. American ideals of courtship and marriage are infused with biblical messages. But what does the Bible really say, and how has it been taught across the centuries in which the institution of marriage has changed dramatically and often. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about belief, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today we\u2019ll explore nuances of Jewish and Christian teachings about marriage, family, and divorce. Whether a couple is religious or secular, modern relationships echo with imagery from the Book of Genesis. \u201CThe Lord God said, \u2018It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a fitting helper for him.\u2019 And the Lord God fashioned the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man. Then the man said, \u2018This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called woman, for from man was she taken.\u2019 Hence, a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh.\u201D But what does one flesh mean in our time? This hour we\u2019ll speak with a rabbi and a New Testament scholar. Each of these men is, in some sense, more conservative than liberal when it comes to theology, but they offer creative ways to imagine the problems and promises of modern relationship. Neither feels comfortable talking about marriage in our time without including some reflection on committed homosexual relationship. In fact, a close reading of the New Testament reveals a deep ambivalence about the institution of marriage and the centrality of family. We\u2019ll hear about that in a moment from Luke Timothy Johnson of Emory University. He\u2019s a former celibate monk who is now a husband and father. From ancient times, Jewish thought on the subject of marriage has been strikingly reality-based. Rabbinic dialogue gives detailed instruction on how to manage and nurture a marriage. It stresses the needs of women as well as men, and the rabbis always conceded that marriage is difficult and that failure is possible. My first guest, Rabbi Elliot Dorff, is rector and professor of philosophy at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, California, and a leading articulator of law and ethics in the conservative tradition of Judaism. When he reflects on marriage, he begins where the Hebrew Bible begins, with Genesis and creation. Here\u2019s the passage in the Garden of Eden where he points out sexuality and the body were God\u2019s first gifts to humankind. \u201CAnd God said, \u2018Let us make man in our image after our likeness.\u2019 And God created man in his image. In the image of God he created him; male and female, he created them. God blessed them, and God said to them, \u2018Be fertile and increase. Fill the Earth and master it.'\u201D Rabbi Elliot Dorff. First of all, God creates the human being, the entirety of the human being, and calls it not only good but very good in the opening chapter of Genesis. That\u2019s not just the soul, as it were. That\u2019s the body as well. And so from the point of view of the Jewish tradition, the body, the emotions, the will, the mind, all of these things are part of God\u2019s creation. They are morally neutral, all of them, and their moral valence, as it were, depends upon how we use those things. And then in terms of specifically the energies of the body, what the Jewish tradition is interested in doing is taking the various desires of the body and channeling them toward good purpose as defined by the Torah. And sexuality would be considered an energy of the body. That\u2019s right. One of the energies of the body, sort of like your desire for food. What the Jewish tradition does with that is, first of all, the dietary laws as to what you may eat in order to \u2014 that gives you a sense of the fact that the animal kingdom, and life even in the animal kingdom is something to be respected. Well, in terms of sex, both in the stories at the beginning of Genesis and also in the laws of Judaism, it\u2019s clear that there are two purposes for sex as the tradition understood it. In the first chapter of Genesis, you have \u201CBe fruitful and multiply,\u201D so clearly procreation is one of the purposes of marriage. And then in the second chapter of Genesis, you get, \u201CIt\u2019s not good for one to live alone, so a man leaves his father and mother and literally\u2026 \u201CAnd cleaves to his wife,\u201D yeah. \u201C\u2026and cleaves to his wife,\u201D literally sticks to his wife, right? Yeah. Yeah. Clearly, then the other purpose of sex within marriage is companionship. Do you know, I have spent a lot of time with Genesis over the years, but I noticed for the first time when I was getting ready to talk to you that in the first chapter of Genesis, which seems to be the more egalitarian story \u2014 right? \u2014 man and woman are created together\u2026 Right. \u2026the emphasis is on procreation. Yes. \u201CBe fruitful and multiply.\u201D In the second and third chapters, the Garden of Eden, which feminists have interpreted as where the woman is subordinate and woman is taken from man\u2019s rib, which feels a bit insulting to women, the emphasis is on companionship. Well, actually the rabbis carry that on. I mean, on the legal level, you have a commandment to be fruitful and multiply. And then the other commandment that\u2019s relevant to us is in Exodus Chapter 21 in which the Torah says that when a man takes a wife, then her food, her clothing and her conjugal rights he may not diminish. But the Jewish tradition from the very beginning assumes that women have sexual desires just as much as men do and that satisfying both of the sexual desires of men and of women is what marriage is all about, or at least one of the purposes of marriage, right? And the rabbis do what they usually do with the commandments. Namely, they then try to define the commandments. So how do they define that? Well, a man may never force himself upon a woman. They understood marital right. And how often does he have to offer her to, you know, to have sex in order to satisfy her desires? Well, according to the Mishna, it depends upon what he does for a living. So if he\u2019s home every night, then he has to offer to have sex with her every night. If he\u2019s a donkey driver and home every other night, then every other night. Then if he\u2019s a scholar, then once a week on Friday night on the Sabbath. Theologically \u2014 or what is the rationale? Is it simply that our sexuality is part of what it is to be human and that there\u2019s an understanding that that needs to find expression? Right, and that marriage is the proper place in which to\u2026 And that\u2019s a good thing, and that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s a very good thing. \u2026the proper place. It\u2019s a very good thing. It\u2019s not right to remain alone. And hence, you get \u2014 this is not just theoretical \u2014 a long history of you know, I remember that when I finished rabbinical school, we were told already in rabbinical school that if you weren\u2019t married by the time you finished \u2014 at that time it was only men that were being ordained \u2014 the sisterhood would do absolutely everything in its power to get you married off within the first year that you were, you know, serving a congregation, which is indeed true. Yeah. And then I think that the structure of Jewish life also supports marriage, even something like Sabbath, just having that down time and that rest. The Sabbath is probably the best antidote to workaholic phenomenon in America that I think has ever existed because it effectively \u2014 it says that from sunset on Friday, you know, actually, a few \u2014 about 20 minutes before sunset on Friday until about 40 minutes after sunset on Saturday, you may not work. And you do have, on the contrary, obligations to be with family and friends and be part of \u2014 and go to synagogue. And basically it\u2019s one of the most important ways of renewing, you know, family life. It was always important, but it\u2019s especially important when people are sort of eating breakfast on the run. They often don\u2019t have lunch together. Even dinner \u2014 I mean, many families, especially with teenagers, you know, don\u2019t or are not able to have together during the week because they all have these extracurricular activities and the like. I think that\u2019s probably a good discipline for a modern marriage. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right. And it has a lot of symbolism also because the Sabbath is supposed to be sort of a reenactment of the Garden of Eden and also a foretaste \u2014 and the rabbis talk about this \u2014 is a foretaste of the world to come. So it\u2019s supposed to be this idyllic time in which you don\u2019t have to work for a living. All of that has been prepared ahead of time. You\u2019re not allowed to cook on the Sabbath. You\u2019re not allowed to work on the Sabbath. You\u2019re not \u2014 I mean, you don\u2019t have to write\u2026 Right. So nobody is harried and overburdened. Nobody\u2019s harried. In most traditional homes, they don\u2019t answer the phone on the Sabbath and things on that order, right? Yeah. Cell phone, whatever. No computers, no e-mail, none of that. And you simply talk to each other and you sing together and you catch up with each other, and this ultimate sense of being completed comes both in terms of time together and in terms of sumptuous meals and in terms of time to take a nap on Saturday afternoon and sex between a husband and wife. Rabbi Elliot Dorff. He\u2019s a leading ethical thinker in the conservative tradition of Judaism. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. We\u2019re talking about marriage, family, and divorce in Jewish tradition. From ancient times, it was supportive of marriage in practical ways, and Jewish marriages were more stable than the general population. But as newer generations have become more secularized, this has changed. In response, the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, where Rabbi Dorff is rector, created one of the most successful marriage preparation courses in the country. It started in 1975. It was Rabbi Aaron Weiss who had been the rabbi of a large conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. And in 2000 they did a survey of all of the people that had gone through the program, and eight percent had ultimately ended in divorce. So how do you explain that? In some ways, because when people go through \u2014 it\u2019s a 10-week program. It\u2019s 10 couples together. And sometimes during the course of the 10-week program, because of the curriculum, which gets them to talk to each other about a variety of different important things, sometimes they decide, \u201CYou know, maybe we shouldn\u2019t get married.\u201D So some of them \u2014 which is much better for them to decide beforehand than afterward. So some of it is that, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that they get skills through these courses in terms of how to interact with each other. I mean, the first \u2014 it\u2019s 10 sessions. I think the first five deal with communication skills. They come to talk with each other and then in a group about strategies to deal with parents, strategies to deal with friends of one who are not friends of the other, issues of jobs versus children and how to handle them. Well, one really important one is how do you have a fight and still come out married? And part of it has to do also with expectations. I love Broadway musicals, so the way that I like to put it is this, right? The Hollywood image of marriage is from South Pacific. \u201CSome enchanted evening you will meet a stranger across the crowded room. You\u2019ll know even then that somehow you\u2019ll meet her again and again.\u201D Right? Yes. And so the image that you get is that marriage is a series of enchanted evenings. And then when you get married and you find out that indeed there are some enchanted evenings, but most of them are sort of ho-hum and some of them are downright unenchanted, you begin to think that \u2014 if that was your expectation, you begin to think, \u201CWell, maybe this is not the marriage for me,\u201D and you break up. As opposed to Fiddler on the Roof, right? \u201CAfter 25 years, do you love me?\u201D \u201CWell, for 25 years we\u2019ve done this, that and that. Now you ask me do I love you? Well, I suppose I do.\u201D \u201CAnd I suppose I love you, too. After 25 years, it doesn\u2019t change a thing, but it\u2019s nice to know.\u201D Right? Now there, I mean, what that piece speaks is I think the traditional Jewish understanding of marriage. That is, you get married primarily because you like each other enough to do the work of family together, that is to grow old together, to have companionship, to have children, to raise those children. My own grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, had an arranged marriage. My mom asked her why she married my grandfather, and she said, \u201CWell, because I had heard he was a kind man, and that was enough for me.\u201D And they had an idyllic marriage. When you think about these practical skills of communication and knowing how to fight, is that also something that you think about theologically? I mean, those are things we\u2019ve learned in modern times about what makes a good modern marriage. I\u2019m wondering if the tradition also expanded on this notion of companionship. Absolutely. There are passages in Jewish literature which talk about how a man is supposed to try to be very sensitive to his wife\u2019s moods. He\u2019s supposed to hon\u2026 That\u2019s good advice. He\u2019s supposed to honor his wife more than himself. There are even manuals that were written in the Middle Ages about how a man is supposed to treat his wife and others having to do with sexual activity, you know, how to make sure that it\u2019s pleasurable for her as well as for him. There\u2019s a series of other things. Now, I mean, of course, Jewish marriages were to some extent influenced by the marriages of the cultures in which they lived. So the relationships between husbands and wives living in Muslim countries were to some extent influenced by Islam, Islamic practices, and in northern European countries by Christian practices. But throughout the tradition, you get love poetry. See, Song of Songs is a book in the Bible \u2014 right? \u2014 which is simply love poetry. And even though Rebbe Akiva later interpreted it as the love poem between God and the people of Israel, nevertheless, if you simply look \u2014 I mean, sure, he understood that, as everyone else does, that it\u2019s just simply love poetry that is, frankly, very graphic and\u2026 And is it describing marital love? Some of it is, and some of it is not. I mean, some of it is \u2014 some of it is courting. It\u2019s not at all afraid about talking about the desirous nature of the body of the opposite sex, in both directions, by the way, because there are some of the poems that are written by women and some of them written by men. But, interestingly, along the lines that you were just asking me about, in the wedding ceremony, the only description of the couple themselves is as rei\u2019im ha-ahuvim, the loving companions, where \u201Cloving\u201D is the adjective, but \u201Ccompanions\u201D is the noun, right? So they are, first and foremost, companions. The word \u201Chelpmeet\u201D that, you know, has become sort of a cliche, I think, helpmeet, helpmate. Ezer knegdo, yes. Isn\u2019t that a very interesting word in the Hebrew that has a lot more complexity? What does\u2026 Yes, it does. Yeah. What does that connote? Well, the word is \u2014 I mean, there are, frankly, a series of different\u2026 And that\u2019s in Genesis. That\u2019s in Genesis. That\u2019s correct. This is the second chapter of Genesis in which man is alone, Adam is alone, and he feels lonely. And then Eve is created as ezer knegdo. And both of the Hebrew words are subject to a lot of interpretation. First of all, the word l\u2019ezer means \u201Cto help,\u201D but then the word knegdo means literally \u201Copposite him.\u201D But it also can mean \u201Con a par with him.\u201D So as much as she is a help to him, he is a help to her, right? So it could be understood in an egalitarian kind of way. It\u2019s usually not understood that way. It\u2019s usually understood as the woman being the help to the man. But opposite, I mean, doesn\u2019t that imply the tension that we know between men and women in marriage, which it sort of acknowledges, also is a constructive thing? I mean, right? Right. Exactly. The tradition recognizes the fact that men and women are different. I mean, some of that, of course, comes out of certain stereotypical roles for husbands and for wives that the tradition creates. And as a matter of fact, when it comes down to duties, the Talmud spells out what the duties are of a man toward his wife and of a woman toward her husband. And I think the important thing to note there is that it\u2019s not just in one direction. It\u2019s not just that the woman has duties to her husband. It\u2019s quite the opposite. If anything, the marriage contract that we use talks about all the duties that the man has to his wife, not the other way around. And what the rabbis tried to do for \u2014 what the Torah itself tries to do is to take an inherently unequal situation in the ancient world and to make it more equal. Rabbi Elliot Dorff. Today on Speaking of Faith we\u2019re exploring the nuances of what Christian and Jewish traditions have to say about marriage and divorce. Rabbi Dorff is a respected interpreter of ancient wisdom as applied to modern realities. The Jewish Torah provides for divorce, and so from the earliest times Jewish tradition has not treated divorce as a sin. Rabbi Dorff has written that divorce is sometimes the right thing to do, sometimes a tragedy, and often both. The Talmud teaches that the temple altar itself sheds tears upon the termination of a marriage. It sees divorce as a sad thing but not as a sin, and so it\u2019s clearly not something that one should do flippantly. But on the other hand, sometimes divorce is what really, you know, what is necessary. And, I mean, do you think that in some ways you \u2014 that might be surprising because marriage is so highly valued, but, on the other hand, because marriage is described in a complex way, is the allowance of divorce also an acknowledgment of that? That\u2019s right. Basically, see, in American law until the 1970s, except in Nevada, if you wanted to get divorced, you had to show either adultery or insanity in your partner. That\u2019s why Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1968 had to fly to Nevada to divorce his wife because he wasn\u2019t willing to say that she was insane or adulterous. But in the Jewish tradition, this goes back to the rabbis. There don\u2019t have to be any grounds for divorce. It can simply be what we would call incompatibility. They don\u2019t like each other anymore and so they may divorce. The tradition did what it could to try to delay the process, to try to get them to reconcile, because it understood that divorce comes at a great cost to both partners and certainly at great cost to the children, if there are\u2026 The children. \u2026and so you don\u2019t do this lightly. But at the same time if this is the right and proper thing to do, then you don\u2019t have to show that, you don\u2019t have to demonstrate that to any rabbis or a court or anything. In fact, the court only supervises the process. And you\u2019ve said that while it\u2019s allowed and allowed for in these practical ways, it\u2019s also seen as an occasion of deep regret\u2026 Divorce, yeah. \u2026and sadness and grief. And I wonder also, does Jewish ritual also make a place for that sadness to be expressed? Part \u2014 what happens is that the divorce writ has to be written specifically for this couple. That\u2019s one of the ways in which the rabbis delayed the process in hopes of making sure that they really needed to be divorced. Once it is, then there\u2019s the ceremony in which the man gives it to the woman or her agent. They don\u2019t have to be together in order for this, to do this. Sometimes it\u2019s too painful for the couple to do. But if they are there and doing it together, then the man gives the document to the woman, who takes it in cupped hands and then walks with it for several steps to indicate, you know, graphically that what\u2019s happening is that the two of them are leaving each other. And in our own time, there have been a number of other rituals that people have devised to talk about the grief that men and women have in marriage. It\u2019s much \u2014 just because of the way that Anglo-Saxons are sort of created in our country, it\u2019s much harder for men to express that kind of grief than it is for women. And so one of the things that\u2019s been sort of interesting is men\u2019s support groups as well as women\u2019s support groups in this kind of thing. It\u2019s very hard to get men to come to those kinds of support groups, truthfully, because of the way that men are acculturated to American society is that they\u2019re not supposed to show their feelings, which is, frankly, crazy. Here\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you before we go. You are a rabbi, and you have four adult children. And I\u2019m wondering, as you watch them be adults in our time, what are some of the ways that you see them struggling with this tradition, particularly of marriage and divorce in Judaism, and what are some of the ways that their struggles bring you back to reconsider the tradition? My own family is, in some ways, really, statistically I think fairly typical of other families. I have a daughter and a son who got married, married people who were very much part of the community and the like. I have a son who married somebody who was part of the Jewish community, but they got divorced two and a half years later. And then about seven years after that, he married a Jew by choice, that is somebody who\u2026 Who converted to Judaism, OK. \u2026a woman who converted to Judaism. Right. And I have a daughter who came out as a lesbian and was just recently artificially inseminated and gave us our first grandson. And so\u2026 So you have a modern family. I have a modern family. And how do you hold that together as the Biblical norm, as an ideal, with the reality that divorce happens, that you have a daughter who will never marry a man. Right. How do you reconcile that ideal, that norm, with these other realities, which you also, clearly, you don\u2019t judge? You\u2019re not condemning these other \u2014 so\u2026 No. No, not at all. I mean, I think\u2026 So how does it work? I mean, how are we supposed to live with those norms? Well, I think that the tradition very much prized marriage and saw that as the primary way to do it. It also understood divorce and did not condemn it as a sin and saw it as being something that you do only after a lot of consideration and every attempt to reconcile, but sometimes there was divorce. It did not know about single parents, except in the case of widowhood or divorce. And in the case of single parents, it tried to get them remarried as quickly as possible. And interestingly, that continues on in the Jewish community. Even though the rate of divorce in the contemporary Jewish community is more or less the same as it is in the general American population, the rate of remarriage in the Jewish community is far higher. Gays and lesbians, of course, out of the closet is a whole new phenomenon in our generation, let alone their having children qua gays and lesbians. And I also think that it\u2019s not good for them to be alone any more than it\u2019s good for \u2026 for straights to be alone, and so I think we in the Jewish community need to create the matchmaker again.

He\u2019s the author of Love Your Neighbor and Yourself: A Jewish Approach to Modern Personal Ethics. This is Speaking of Faith.

Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about belief, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CMarriage, Family, and Divorce.\u201D We\u2019re exploring some of the nuances of Jewish and Christian teachings on the institution of marriage. Biblical symbols and phrases are part of the American rituals of courtship, marriage and family, even for many who are not religious at all. And Christian teachings are woven into American culture\u2019s moral sensibility about marriage and sexuality. In recent decades, as the divorce rate grew and fewer and fewer families have included two biological married parents, more and more Christian groups have created marriage enrichment programs and pro-family movements. But, according to my next guest, Christian tradition expresses ambivalence towards marriage and family. Emory University theologian Luke Timothy Johnson is one of the most highly regarded experts on Christian traditions and the author of a classic work, The Writings of the New Testament. He brings historical, literary and theological context to modern questions surrounding marriage, family and divorce. It\u2019s not a simple matter to be reading these ancient texts as guiding our lives; relatively simple, though involved, to read them as historical sources or as cultural texts. That\u2019s fun and interesting because it\u2019s \u201Cother.\u201D But when we try to bring them home and to think about how do our lives correspond to them, how can we imagine our own lives while imagining scripture simultaneously, it\u2019s difficult. Why do we do it? The same texts that confuse us are also the ones that give us life. Luke Johnson says that the vigorous pro-family message coined in our time is not to be found easily in the New Testament. The New Testament does not provide Christians with a positive living model of marriage. Muslims have a prophet who married several times and fathered children. Jews have many examples of marriage and family in all its complexity among the patriarchs and matriarchs. But Jesus never married. Jesus\u2019 disciples left their families behind to follow him. Later the apostle Paul remained celibate and preached this as a moral ideal to new Christians. In short, modern Christians inherit in scripture a deeply conflicted message about whether and how marriage and family matter. For Luke Timothy Johnson, this does not mean that modern people can\u2019t consult Christian tradition for guidance. But taking it seriously means acknowledging its complexity and its contradictions. The real tragedy in Christian theology about marriage is that it has tended to look only at the sacred texts \u2014 this is really important \u2014 and has tended to ignore the experience of actual married people. I mean, a great deal of Christian theology was carried out by monks and celibates who, quite literally, didn\u2019t know who they were talking about. So what Jesus doesn\u2019t give us, what the New Testament doesn\u2019t give us, where are we going to learn it? Well, one way, by default, is to simply take all of those things in the Bible that affirm marriage, sex and family in a sort of a straightforward way, losing that critical edge that Christianity brings to that. You\u2019re right. You can pluck out verses which affirm marriage. Absolutely. But talk about, holistically, what is to be found there. On the subject of sex, family and marriage, yes. On the subject of \u2014 yeah, sex, marriage and family. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a whole collection of thoughts \u2014 is that \u2014 and guidance. That\u2019s correct, and they go together. They\u2019re interrelated. And what really distinguishes the Christian collection, the New Testament canon, is this deeply conflictual character. So on the one side you have, let us say with family, you have clear passages that affirm family and the household. For example, in Paul\u2019s letters to his delegates, qualities of good parenting are qualifications for leadership within the community. Young widows are to marry and raise their children and run households. So all of this is very affirming of family, and you can pick out those texts. On the other side, Jesus says, \u201CIf you want to follow me, you have to hate your father and mother.\u201D Right. You know, \u201CLeave your wife and your husband and your children, by the way. Abandon them and come follow me.\u201D A reading from the Book of Matthew. \u201CJesus said, \u2018For I have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one\u2019s foes will be members of one\u2019s own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.'\u201D A reading from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11, verses 34 through 37. I\u2019ve heard lots of sermons in my life trying to massage that and interpret it so that it is palatable. Again, this is the case of Christians tending to privilege one set of texts and ignoring the other set. And all Christians do that. The question is, are they doing it with any degree of responsibility at all? I have to share a story with you on this very point. Many years ago I gave a talk at a conference called \u201CGod Doesn\u2019t Like Families,\u201D and I basically wanted to trace that stream in scripture from Abraham on \u2014 right? \u2014 \u201Cleave your family, leave your home,\u201D right? Yes. And running through the New Testament and suggesting God doesn\u2019t seem to be that interested in families. Or as a colleague of mine, Luther Smith, memorably said in a sermon one time, what the Bible seems to say is that families are necessary, but they\u2019re not sufficient. And I was asked by a local parish if I would come give a talk on that subject. And I sent them the title \u201CGod Doesn\u2019t Like Families.\u201D I arrived in the church. I opened the bulletin and it said, \u201CGodlike Families.\u201D So I began my presentation by saying, \u201CThis is the problem.\u201D So they had misprinted your\u2026 Yeah. They had mis \u2014 quite deliberately. They thought my title was very much too scandalous. Quite deliberately. Right. Godlike families. Yes. That\u2019s right. And so clearly one problem within one version of Christianity is a kind of idolatrous posture with regard to family, so that a family is not only necessary, which all of us would acknowledge, but that it\u2019s also sufficient. And losing that edge which is essential to the biblical tradition the prophetic edge of moving beyond family, moving behind kinship into a larger world which is God\u2019s creation. But are those two things in tension? How are\u2026 Oh, indeed they are in tension. \u2026they in tension? Does that make it more difficult to be committed to your family necessarily? I think it actually helps being committed in a more appropriate way. I think, for example, that good parenting does not have as its goal keeping kids at home. It\u2019s preparing them to be free to leave home, so that a certain degree of distancing is required even to do the job, that if you cling too closely, you ruin them. Just as if you abandon them, you ruin them. So there is that tension. That\u2019s probably true in marriage, isn\u2019t it, as well? Exactly the truth. Giving the partner space is really important in order even to have intimacy. So that if there\u2019s not really two persons there, you really can\u2019t have intimacy. So, similarly, the draw outside the kinship system to serve a larger world I suspect is a premise for really good commitment to the kinship system, to family. Unless I see our family life as part of a larger ecology, the tendency is to make it idolatrous, to absolutize it. And we\u2019ve certainly done that, especially in our age with the nuclear family, right? I mean, it\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026just gets tinier and tinier, and it is the center of the universe. Absolutely. So, I mean, what you\u2019re saying is you can affirm it, and you can be critical at the same time, and that the Bible\u2026 Yes, but I\u2019m also saying this. \u2026asks us to do that? Yes, but I\u2019m also saying this. These alternative forms of family that people are thinking about now also provide us an opportunity to think about what is the essence of family itself as opposed to what are the accidentals of family. So that we can view our present societal situation, fatherless families \u2014 and in some ways it really does represent a crisis, obviously \u2014 homosexual families, adoptive families, for example, or other kinds of groupings of people \u2014 we can regard that as a challenge to the family, a threat, or we can regard it as a reminder that kinship and belonging in the human reality is a matter of social construction, and it is a matter of choice, even one\u2019s own family. I mean, one can be born into a biological family, obviously \u2014 many of us are \u2014 and leave it and leave it behind and hate it. And we just want to get free of it. Family is not just given but chosen. New Testament theologian Luke Timothy Johnson. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, exploring marriage, family and divorce in the biblical traditions. Luke Timothy Johnson points out that for early Christians, all the rules and structures of this world, including marriage and family, were up for grabs. This comes through especially in the writings of the apostle Paul. He chose not to marry in what he believed were the end times. Jesus had preached a message of radical equality between men and women, and this too defied old ways of being. And though Jesus and Paul talked often about love, they were not usually speaking of the romantic love we associate with marriage. The most common New Testament notion of love was agape, or practical love. I think that the deepest Christian dimension of love is this dimension of agape, of self-giving, of mutuality. I apply this absolutely to my life in as concrete a way as trying to cook a gumbo. I mean that if my little daughter came knocking at the door of my study when I\u2019m trying to write a paper, that is the call of God to me. \u201CDaddy, come play with me.\u201D On the other hand, if I answer every time and go play with her, I make a tyrant out of her. If I never answer the door because I\u2019ve got my project to do, then she stops knocking, and there\u2019s another loss. So this agapic love, this love of looking to the good of the other, is never simple. It calls for what I call the asceticism of attentiveness. I mean, one really has to be alert at every moment to what are the real needs of the other and what are my own needs, and how do I live in a way in which there is flourishing. This word agape that you\u2019re referring to is the Greek. There are different words for love which connote different things that we tend to mush together\u2026 That\u2019s exactly right. \u2026in the word \u201Clove.\u201D Right. So there\u2019s eros, which is the more erotic, romantic love. Romantic love, and that\u2019s usually the basis for marriage in the Western world. Right. But agape is really the way of living in the New Testament, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s right. Which has all this connotation of practical care? Looking to the good of the other for the other\u2019s sake. And it\u2019s all\u2026 Not for your sake. Not for my own sake. Now, in between those two kinds of love and I think very important for married life, the middle term, if you will, is the love that\u2019s called filia, friendship, which I think is extraordinarily important. The friendship in our contemporary world tends to be acquaintance, sort of a casual thing. For ancient philosophers and for most of Christian theology and Jewish theology, friendship is one of the most important philosophical topics because the friend is another self. And there is an intimacy of, not of gazing into each other\u2019s eyes, as Saint-Exupery said, but of looking together in the same direction. And I think a marriage without friendship is not a real marriage. A marriage can lose some of the erotic element; can\u2019t lose the friendship dimension. And I think that you present this in some of your papers, that, you know, Paul, also like Jesus, was not married. He was leading what looks like a celibate life, right? I think that\u2019s quite clear, yeah. OK. So you can read some of what\u2019s in the New Testament and feel that it\u2019s quite dismissive of sexuality, that it\u2019s a problem \u2014 right? \u2014 that you sort of have to address, but you don\u2019t want to spend too much time on. But you can also read it that it\u2019s acknowledged to be a powerful dimension of life, and that precisely because it is so powerful, it\u2019s important that it be ordered\u2026 Yes. \u2026and that it be fulfilling in that marital relationship so that Christians can get on with all the other important things in life. Is that a fair reading? I think that\u2019s a very fair reading. And I think the single greatest and most important text here is Paul\u2019s first letter to the Corinthians. This is the famous passage in which Paul says it\u2019s better to marry than burn. But a more careful reading reveals that this is really quite a remarkable passage. It\u2019s remarkable, first of all, simply because of its gender equality. Unlike any philosophical text that I know in antiquity, he addresses both partners. He addresses the man, he addresses the woman, and he carries that all the way through the discussion. This is quite thrilling to me. From a letter of the apostle Paul to the new Christians at Corinth: \u201CFor the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does. Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer. And then come together again so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. \u201CTo the unmarried and the widows, I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.\u201D A reading from First Corinthians. Paul\u2019s argument is for him, it\u2019s not that sex is unimportant; it\u2019s so powerful. So it\u2019s a pretty positive view of what marriage is about, I think. And, you know, it strikes me often that in our society there\u2019s a well, there\u2019s a great obsession with sexuality in general. But what is dividing churches now is this matter of homosexuality, is different kinds of sexual lifestyles aside from marriage. But that in the sweep of the New Testament, there\u2019s much, much, much more teaching about marriage and divorce which, at the same time that alternative sexual lifestyles have grown, the institution of marriage is in huge disarray. I mean, how do you read what the New Testament says about divorce and what that has to say to us today? Yeah, I think you\u2019re right. I\u2019d like to pick up from your first comment about we\u2019re so sexualized. We obsess about sexuality. Whether or not we\u2019re actually more robustly sexual I think is a really open and interesting question. In my view, homosexuality has become a scapegoat for churches to keep them from focusing upon the genuine lack of engagement with the very serious issues with sexuality. With heterosexuality. With heterosex \u2014 and my argument is that the church must be against porneia, the church must stand against sexual sin. Yeah, and porneia I think is very interesting. You know, you talk about what\u2019s happening with Internet pornography, and you know that the Greek word that\u2019s used in the New Testament is porneia\u2026 Porneia. \u2026and you translate that as sexual sin. Sexual, yeah, immorality in the broadest sense, so it includes prostitution, it clearly would obviously include pornography and all these kinds of things. So the church has to take a stand against this. The forms of sexuality that are violent, that are manipulative, that are exploitative, that are breaking boundaries, obviously, all these things are clearly incompatible, that are noncovenanted. My argument about this homosexuality thing is, is that we need to sort of level the playing field a little bit and recognize that what counts for homosexuality also counts for heterosexuality. And so that if we\u2019re going to forbid porneia on one side of the ledger \u2014 namely, homosexuals \u2014 you can\u2019t approve of the baths or promiscuity and so forth, then we have to also look at the Playboy lifestyle with equal seriousness. So the issues then of divorce that you bring up, this is really quite remarkable. If Jesus ever said anything seriously, you know, it\u2019s this, right? This, meaning\u2026 Paul \u2014 divorce. Don\u2019t divorce. And yet, in effect, divorce has become a way of life for Christians. \u201CSome Pharisees came to Jesus, and to test him they asked,\u2019Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?\u2019 He answered, \u2018Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said, \u201CFor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh, so they are no longer two but one flesh.\u201D Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.'\u201D A reading from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 19, verses 3 through 6. This is Speaking of Faith. We\u2019re talking today about what ancient Jewish and Christian teachings actually have to say about marriage, family, and divorce in our time. My guest, Emory University\u2019s Luke Timothy Johnson, explains that Christian scripture is much less tolerant of divorce than Jewish tradition. The New Testament is pretty unequivocal about divorce. I mean, so that you have the sayings of Jesus saying, \u201CDon\u2019t divorce.\u201D Now, it\u2019s clear that this is a really hard saying from the beginning because we have it in an absolute form in Mark. And in Matthew\u2019s gospel, the saying of Jesus is repeated twice. But we see that the Matthean community is already struggling with the absoluteness of Jesus\u2019 command by inserting an exceptive clause. \u201CExcept for porneia\u201D or \u201Cexcept for unchastity,\u201D right? So there\u2019s a wiggle room here. You can divorce if your partner\u2019s\u2026 Right. If it\u2019s happened. \u2026promiscuous or something \u2014 or adulterous. And then Paul, again, he affirms the divorce thing, that is the indissolubility of marriage, but then he also goes on to say, \u201CBut if an unbeliever chooses to separate and doesn\u2019t want to hang around, then the partner is free.\u201D So my point is that we see within the pages of the New Testament itself a struggle with the absoluteness of Jesus\u2019 demand. And that\u2019s partly because Jesus is envisaging the order of creation, and we actually are \u2014 we\u2019re claiming we\u2019re living in the new creation, but we\u2019re also still living within the realm of sin, inadequacy, failure and all of these things. Now, your question, though, is also: What should we think about these texts as we go through the struggles of life? And it seems to me that here again \u2014 I want to bring this back to the level playing field with homosexuality and heterosexuality \u2014 plain fact is we don\u2019t live by a lot of what scripture says, and in a variety of ways we seek to negotiate that gap between what we do and what scripture says. Anybody who says they just live by the New Testament\u2019s just lying, either to themselves or to you, number one, because it\u2019s impossible because scripture says such conflicting things. Right. You can\u2019t live all those different ways at once. You can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t live all those ways \u2014 you can\u2019t be a Presbyterian and a Roman Catholic simultaneously in terms of church order. And they are not a simple script that we live. They really represent an ideal often toward which we strive. If we think of scripture as something \u2014 a script that I simply enact, once I fail to do that, I\u2019ve got to toss out the scripture. I mean, there\u2019s no relationship anymore. It\u2019s sort of like I\u2019m in a relationship with a spouse and I\u2019ve looked lustfully at somebody and, \u201COops, I\u2019ve already committed adultery in effect, so let\u2019s split,\u201D rather than, \u201CLet\u2019s work to repair this,\u201D or, \u201CLet\u2019s get past this thing.\u201D Same thing with this scripture stuff, so I think that what the New Testament is presenting to us on marriage and divorce is an ideal, and we fall short of it. But we don\u2019t want to eliminate those texts because we don\u2019t match up to them, because if we normalize divorce, as our culture has done, if we view it as something as trivial as changing high schools, we really do weaken marriage, right? I mean, we just have sort of serial polygamy, in effect, which is very, very bad for children, very bad for becoming a robust human who is able to deal and work, as you said, through stresses, through hard times and so forth. You know, I left a monastery. My wife is a divorced woman. I mean, I\u2019ve struggled with these issues very much. But I think we need to have the texts say what they\u2019re saying, recognize that we\u2019re not living up to it, and be really honest and self-critical about this. But if we\u2019re doing that, and we say, \u201CI\u2019m still living within the church, even though I\u2019m a divorced person, and I\u2019m going to try to live within that ambiguity, God help me, I can do no other. It\u2019s simply where I am,\u201D then I also have to apply the same thing on the side of homosexuality. Luke Timothy Johnson is Robert W. Woodruff professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University. Earlier in this hour you heard Rabbi Elliot Dorff of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Each of these men, steeped in the texts and the history of his tradition, presents a nuanced and complex understanding of marriage and divorce. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but it does stand in contrast to simplistic pronouncements we sometimes hear in our public life about the Bible\u2019s teachings. Rabbi Dorff\u2019s Jewish perspective is refreshingly realistic with its focus on the goodness of marriage coupled with practical support for marriage. Luke Timothy Johnson\u2019s analysis of Christianity\u2019s ambivalent teaching suggests new ways for analyzing why, in America\u2019s Christian-influenced culture, marriage is so puzzlingly troubled an institution. Finally, it seems important that these two devout, learned men have long been incorporating reflection on committed homosexual relationship into their broadest understanding of what the Bible says about marriage, love and family.
