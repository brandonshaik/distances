  "fullText": "From Occupy Wall Street to the National Association of Evangelicals, there are echoes of what was called the Social Gospel a hundred years ago. This movement coined the phrase, \u201CWhat Would Jesus Do?\u201D And for three years running, its pivotal text by its leading figure, Walter Rauschenbusch, sold more copies than any religious book after the Bible. Rauschenbusch called for Christians to be at the forefront of social renewal, healing that era\u2019s social crisis. But his subject headings alone sound oddly present: The Morale of the Workers; The Physical Decline of the People; The Wedge of Inequality. Fast-forward to today, and Walter Rauschenbusch\u2019s great-grandson, Paul Raushenbush, is the religion editor of the Huffington Post. We have some fun this hour. We learn some things, about reemerging strains in the DNA of Christianity. And we take in a counterintuitive view of religion and culture from an emerging realm of our time. Paul Raushenbush likes to recall a complaint from a blogger named \u201Cgrumpy\u201D to one of his posts on the Huffington Post: \u201CNow I have seen it all, the Huff post asking what would be the correct thing to do from a religious standpoint. \u2026 I cannot believe I am seeing this on the Huff post.\u201D Paul Raushenbush replied, \u201CWell, grumpy \u2014 believe it.\u201D People are surprised, but that\u2019s my standard line: \u201CThis is good, but it could be a little more religion-y\u201D (laughter). And by religion-y, I just mean go deep into your tradition. Don\u2019t be shy about it. From APM, American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being: \u201COccupying the Gospel.\u201D Paul Brandeis Raushenbush has been Senior Religion Editor of the Huffington Post since that section\u2019s launch in 2010. He also spent nine years as chaplain and Associate Dean of Religious Life at Princeton University. He grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, where Walter Rauschenbusch\u2019s son settled with his wife, who happened to be the daughter of Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice. Despite his noble lineage, Paul says, he only distinguished himself religiously in his early years by being the first person to flunk out of Presbyterian confirmation. And you, of course, had in your DNA and in your family history this great American Christian religious figure of Walter Rauschenbusch. How aware of that were you of him? How did you become aware of him growing up? You know, we really weren\u2019t particularly aware of him. I think we may have said one of his prayers at Thanksgiving. He has beautiful prayers. If people are interested in Walter Rauschenbusch, they should first go to the prayers because they really are the right door to understanding who he was. So he had a beautiful Thanksgiving prayer that we would read on Thanksgiving or occasionally at grace. But, you know, my parents were very reluctant to kind of get into, well, you have this important great-grandfather or \u2026 You also had two important great-grandfathers, right? The other one, Justice Brandeis? Yeah. Brandeis was actually much more the kind of overwhelming figure, and I knew much more about Brandeis than I did Rauschenbusch. It was only later actually in seminary and even beyond when I started to read Rauschenbusch and really began to actually resonate with what his message was and found myself just loving his writing style and what he had to say and he felt so fresh and contemporary and funny and heart-rending. So that\u2019s when I really began to realize that actually I kind of had a kindred spirit with him. But it really wasn\u2019t a part of growing up. You know, Rauschenbusch was in the background. So let\u2019s talk about this person of Walter Rauschenbusch because he really was a very important figure in the very early 20th century. You know, he was an exemplar and a very strong voice in the roots of American Protestantism and indeed what called itself Evangelicalism that were socially activists, this Social Gospel movement that people roughly date between something like 1880 and 1920. Say something about that \u2014 that world that he helped create and that he came out of. Well, talking about the world he came out of is really important because Walter was the seventh generation of pastors who \u2014 his father came over as a Lutheran missionary to the United States, became a Baptist, taught at a German Baptist seminary. And Walter was raised in a very Evangelical atmosphere, went to seminary and, you know, it was a time when people were beginning to talk about historical critical method. People were beginning to talk about, well, what is the Gospel saying to the situation in the world? Rauschenbusch\u2019s first pastorate was in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in New York City, which was, at that time, very aptly named. It was a really rough part of the world. He dates his real conversion to that experience. His first book was dedicated to the people of that pastorate, who opened his eyes for a second time because, you know, what he said about that time, he said, \u201CI just kept burying too many babies. The little boxes, they broke my heart.\u201D And so he went down there to kind of, you know, transform their spirits and evangelize in a traditional way. And then he became determined because he said, \u201CWell, what does the Gospel say about the lives of these people that are being crushed by poverty? I have to \u2014 I have to \u2014 as a pastor, I have to deal with this. I have to deal with the body of these lives.\u201D He went back to the Bible and he has this great parable: A man was walking through the woods and all around him were the warbling of songbirds and yet he didn\u2019t hear any of it because he was a botanist. And I think this is a great metaphor for how we approach the Bible. You know, we see there what we are expecting to see and then, when he went back with these eyes opened by, you know, the suffering of his congregation, he saw all these calls for social renewal and the idea that the Gospel also dealt with the person and with the lives on this earth, not just afterlife, but this life. Now he took the Old Testament prophets as his guide and as his models. I love something that he wrote about them, just the way he wrote that. Figures like Amos and Jose and Isaiah and Jeremiah, \u201CThey lived in the open air of national life. Every heartbeat of their nation was registered in the pulse throb of the prophets.\u201D Isn\u2019t that great (laughter)? Yeah, it is. Yeah, and he thought that Jesus was the heir of that tradition, that Jesus was the heir and the culmination of the prophetic tradition and that Jesus had kind of brought that into fruition and, to understand Jesus, we had to look at the prophets. And, you know, I could imagine somebody listening to this and saying, \u201CWell, we\u2019ve had Christians enter public life and what that has meant is entering political life and it\u2019s associated with a number of issues.\u201D I think it\u2019s important, though, to really paint this canvas here because, in fact, Walter Rauschenbusch in many ways was quite a different kind of character and the Social Gospel was different. So let\u2019s just flush that out. I mean, he had this insistence that it\u2019s wrong to think of religious morality as the only thing God cares about. He said, \u201CThe social problems are moral problems on a larger scale.\u201D I think Rauschenbusch was in some ways a skeptic of religion, just as he was a pastor and, you know, a national figure on the religious scene. He didn\u2019t de facto take the authority of religious figures. He said they always had to be set up against a test of how they would bring people together. Will they make us a more cohesive, more loving, more positive society? He also said that about Christians. You know, people can be converted and they\u2019d be worse than they were before. Jesus said that about the Pharisees making converts and making them twice as fit for hell. So it wasn\u2019t just a fact of being more religious. It wasn\u2019t a fact of being more religious like a certain kind of religion, Baptist or anything like that. It was really about how are you converted to this wider project of making a more beautiful world where actually heaven is created on earth and we can identify that by people living together peacefully and with equanimity and with more equality. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today: \u201COccupying the Gospel\u201D \u2014 with Huffington Post Religion editor Paul Raushenbush. His great-grandfather, Walter Rauschenbusch, went on sabbatical to Germany in 1907 just as his book Christianity and the Social Crisis was published. He came home a year later to find himself a celebrity. The dedication page of his book was a shortened section from the Lord\u2019s Prayer: \u201CThy Kingdom Come! Thy Will Be Done on Earth!\u201D Rauschenbusch\u2019s de-emphasis on the afterlife and his insistence on the social responsibility of Christians in this life was criticized by some as leftist, even Marxist. But he had a strong friendship with his contemporary the capitalist John D. Rockefeller. In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. cited Rauschenbusch as a deeply formative influence. And Walter Rauschenbusch is read and studied in seminaries \u2014 all kinds of seminaries \u2014 still today. He considered himself Evangelical, and he saw Dwight Moody \u2014 now revered as a founding father of modern Evangelicalism \u2014 as his forebear. I know you\u2019ve been inside this history, but there was also a rift that developed in that time, right? I mean, there was some parting of the ways among \u2014 between different kinds of Protestants and, in fact, a retreat from public life, which, in fact, was \u2014 in some ways those were the forebears of today\u2019s Evangelicals who re-entered public life in the last few decades. Can you say a little bit about how that worked and what the dynamics and issues there were? Well, it\u2019s interesting. When Rauschenbusch started, he hadn\u2019t thought about the personal element of the faith \u2014 might also hold that, you know, kind of in concert with one another. Then, unfortunately, a split developed and, you know, for instance, the Social Gospel was never Rauschenbusch\u2019s term. He didn\u2019t like that term. Oh, I didn\u2019t know that. He later used it in his last book, but he always resisted it. He said, \u201CIt\u2019s just the Gospel. There is no social gospel or private gospel. It\u2019s just the Gospel.\u201D But then you had these divisions and people felt like it was just, you know, that there was no transcendent value to it, that it was just Marxism. And so people forget that Rauschenbusch actually worked with Moody, a very kind of traditional \u2026 Right. Dwight Moody, yeah. Yeah. He translated some of his works into German. I mean, there was a cohesion there at the beginning that Rauschenbusch, it broke his heart. You know, his father, a lot of his colleagues at the seminary, there was a really big effort for him to keep people together, but afterwards, there was a strong split. What\u2019s so interesting for me today is many of the descendants of those people who split off from the Social Gospel into fundamentalism or Evangelicals are now actually some of the most interested people in what the social elements of the Gospel have to say. Right. These young \u2014 mostly young Evangelicals who are all of a sudden saying, \u201CWait a second. What does this have to do with the poverty I see around me?\u201D And they become very active. So what I\u2019m really actually thrilled about right now is this kind of, in a sense, reuniting of the social and the private religious fervor and, in some ways, working together to really see some of the common issues that we all want to face, such as hunger. I mean, a very basic one, poverty. I remember when I first released Christianity and the Social Crisis, the 100th anniversary edition, I contacted Brian McLaren and I said, \u201CHey, I\u2019m not sure if you ever heard of Rauschenbusch, but I released this \u2026 Part of the emerging church movement. Right. Right. He wrote me back this amazing email and said, \u201CI\u2019ve heard of Rauschenbusch and I heard all these sermons growing up about how awful he was and how evil the Social Gospel was. Then I finally read it and I realized, \u2018Oh, my God, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life.'\u201D So he had come this half circle towards, you know, wholeness and I myself had actually become a little more invested in this spiritual element of the Gospel because of the trajectory my life took. Say some more about that trajectory for you. (Laughter) So you know, I went to college and I majored in religion, but I became much more interested in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle, and part of my history is just, you know, getting clean and going to a rough halfway house in south Boston and having this old craggy, Irish Catholic drunk woman \u2014 ex-drunk, I mean, she was a sober drunk. She, you know, would put my shoes under my bed and I would say, \u201CMarilyn, why are you putting my shoes under my bed?\u201D She says, \u201CI want you on your knees praying.\u201D The whole thing was this kind of transformation. That\u2019s when I started to pray again, and that\u2019s actually where I heard The Lord\u2019s Prayer again because you pray that in AA. Right. \u201CThy kingdom come.\u201D \u201CThy kingdom come,\u201D and so it was like this it became such a part of my life. Then to kind of go back later to go into seminary and see like what part The Lord\u2019s Prayer played in Rauschenbusch\u2019s life and his thinking and just realizing this is all a piece, this is all a part of the whole. It was so beautiful. So for me, you know, it\u2019s been an ongoing process of, you know, beautiful discovery. And so you \u2014 you went to Princeton, is this right, in 2003? Is that when you started working? Uh, yeah, I mean, I, you know, I had a series of different kinds of jobs. I worked at the Riverside Church and I\u2019d worked as a chaplain in a drug rehab center in Brazil and all sorts of street kids in Seattle. But I got called to service, Associate Dean of Religious Life in the chapel at Princeton in 2003, which was an incredible honor and privilege. And you know, I can\u2019t imagine that this path that you\u2019d walked, which was growing up with religion as an influence, leaving it behind, coming back with some curiosity, I think that that\u2019s a pretty common trajectory in this culture. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just curious about what you discovered there, how you also understood that in terms of your own journey and also this legacy of Rauschenbusch, which I almost feel like you kind of embody as much as know about, how you then brought this life and legacy of yours then together with this life of students in our age. The great thing about religion at a place like Princeton is that the students really care about knowledge. They\u2019re very curious. They want to know. They\u2019re not willing to, you know, kind of X anything out very quickly. One of the kind of daunting things was I never had to kind of say, \u201CHey, everybody, pay attention.\u201D I mean, they were there, you know, I mean, they were interested and they were looking for authenticity. I think that what young people are looking for more than anything is authenticity. They want to know. They\u2019re looking for meaning. They\u2019re looking for truth. They\u2019re really trying to work these things out in a lot of different ways and I found the interest in religion coming from all different religious traditions. I mean, what\u2019s interesting is how much interest there is in religion on university campuses these days. Right. I don\u2019t know that that story\u2019s really been told, but people \u2026 It\u2019s amazing. I mean, there is incredible attendance in all different religious traditions. There\u2019s great interest. I mean, I had a group of about 25 students who applied to be on this interfaith council and, you know, often we could only accept about 30 percent of the people who applied to be part of this interfaith council, which means that \u2014 and all of them were qualified. It just means that there was a hunger for these conversations, for honest, truthful, authentic conversations. It\u2019s a wonderful thing. I always say that one of the reasons I\u2019m so hopeful about the world is because I got to work with students for a long time, also in such a heightened intellectual atmosphere which really approves of curiosity, approves of exploration. I think we need more spaces like that in our churches and synagogues and mosques where we really approve of that kind of curiosity, where that\u2019s part of what we think of as a religious message. Rather than certainty, actually, curiosity is what defines a religious person. This conversation with Paul Raushenbush sent us looking for his great-grandfather\u2019s prayers. They are poetic and filled with imagery from the natural world. The Thanksgiving prayer mentioned earlier draws to a close with these lines: \u201CGrant us a heart wide open to all this beauty; and save our souls from being so blind that we pass unseeing when even the common thornbush is aflame with your glory.\u201D Find that prayer and another one we loved at onbeing.org. Though I\u2019d read Walter Rauschenbusch when I studied theology, I hadn\u2019t realized until now that the phrase \u201CWhat Would Jesus Do?\u201D came out of his Social Gospel movement. In our time, the acronym W.W.J.D. is pasted on car bumpers and threaded into bracelets and associated with Evangelical Christianity and an emphasis on personal morality. But in its origins a century ago, it was primarily an expression of the conviction that social justice issues are moral issues writ large. So we called up a theologian, John D. Caputo, to hear the fascinating and little-known story behind this phrase \u2014 it\u2019s also a story of the nature of the split between what we now know as Evangelical Christianity and mainline Protestantism. It\u2019s a split, as Paul Raushenbush points out, that new generations are reframing. Find more on our blog at onbeing.org. Coming up, what happens when a theologian from an historic Christian lineage takes up religion on today\u2019s online frontier. It\u2019s very funny because I\u2019m always saying, \u201CThis is really interesting but could you make it more religion-y?\u201D I think people, you know, sometimes when people approach me initially they think they have to kind of erase out the specificity in order to make it OK for everyone. I\u2019m like, \u201CNo, no, no, no I really want you to reference the richness of your tradition so that I can learn.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being: \u201COccupying the Gospel.\u201D My guest, Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, is the great-grandson of Walter Rauschenbusch. He was a galvanizing social activist Christian leader of the early 20th century. Martin Luther King Jr. said he learned from Rauschenbusch, quote, that \u201Cany religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of men and is not concerned about the \u2026 social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting burial.\u201D Paul Raushenbush is a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll producer turned college chaplain and now editor of the Huffington Post Religion section. He helped launch it in February 2010. So you from those earliest days committed yourself openly to convening a discussion that was going to happen between the strident polls of strident religious voices on one end and strident voices, as you named, on the atheist side who denigrate religious people and their traditions. But you\u2019re doing this on Huffington Post, which itself has a very, let\u2019s say, a liberal reputation and can take a very liberal strident tone. How do you walk that line? Is that a challenge? You know, we don\u2019t really \u2014 you know, I \u2014 honestly, it\u2019s not about left-right liberal-conservative. In some ways, it\u2019s about trying to figure out like how do you live life well? I mean, we do have people who come in with really hard-core political views and then they say, \u201CAnd Jesus said love your neighbor.\u201D I\u2019m always like that\u2019s kind of lazy. You know, I mean, let\u2019s really actually start with what Jesus said and then whatever evolves from that. But I really sometimes say, \u201CYou know, it\u2019s not OK.\u201D What I\u2019m not looking for is just like political view plus Jesus. It has to be like really more and more I\u2019m getting a much broader kind of audience and much broader kind of writing, you know, bloggers who are really interested in being a part on the same page, not necessarily agreeing with, but on the same page as people who think differently. And so we\u2019re really trying to get beyond this kind of left-right. You know, I\u2019m actually \u2014 the one thing I really don\u2019t like on the page is like people who are just so stridently anti-religion that they\u2019re just like all religious people are idiots. I mean \u2026 That\u2019s a lot of the comments there? Yeah, we have a lot of comments like that. You know, I kind of feel like the women\u2019s section of this site wouldn\u2019t have like blatant misogynists. We don\u2019t have to have people who just hate religion and think, you know, simplistic ideas that religion is the source of all evil. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2026 I mean, what\u2019s that about? Where do you see that coming from in our culture? Because it is a kind of stridency that resides more on the liberal, or whatever these labels mean, in American secular liberal culture, though, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Yeah. I mean, that may be the case now. It certainly wasn\u2019t the case with, you know, Martin Luther King Jr. or other people. I think it\u2019s a fairly recent phenomenon, but the idea of liberal versus religious is just a crazy dichotomy and it doesn\u2019t take into account any of the actual history of America. I want to say one other thing about that. There are atheists who are interested in interfaith conversations and there are secularists who really want to be part of a conversation about meaning, and I think that\u2019s important. I do. I always want to know, OK, so what are the seculars bringing to the table? Like one of my cousins \u2026 Mm-hmm, in terms of positive content? Well, in terms of tradition. I mean, my cousin Dick Rorty, who wrote the afterword to Christianity and the Social Crisis, was a very famous secular humanist who was, you know, a philosopher and a pragmatist and one of the most well-known philosophers of the 20th century. He was an amazing man. I loved to hear him talk. I loved to hear his ideas. I thought it was so important what he had to say. So what I\u2019m looking for, for people who are not religious or who come from a secular humanist tradition, is bring it. Where do you find your roots? You know, figure out what you believe and why you believe it. And do you think that\u2019s a challenge for modern people? I mean, I feel like there\u2019s a few generations here, especially when you and I were growing up, where it was actually not an intelligent, educated thing to have deep convictions and present them. Because, in fact, it might work against tolerance and pluralism. Right. I think that the idea of \u2014 I mean, in some ways, it ties into this idea of, OK, what do I want to say about that? In our personal conversations, people never talked about religion. Only later did I figure out that a couple of my good friends in high school were Jewish. We just never talked about it. Right, and didn\u2019t know how to talk about it, right? I mean, didn\u2019t actually have a robust, intelligent vocabulary for talking about it outside the confines of our own \u2026 Well, we were told not to talk about it. Right. You know, religion is something you don\u2019t talk about. So we privatized it in such a way that we didn\u2019t have the language to talk about it. I think that that was a polite way to interact it, but it\u2019s such an amazing thing. The moment you ask someone like, \u201CWhat do you really believe? What is your tradition?\u201D It opens everything up. So I think you\u2019re getting at something that actually is quite striking when you go to the Huffington Post Religion site and there\u2019s a lot going on there. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s very straightforward that I hadn\u2019t thought about this way. But it is along the lines of developing a vocabulary and a basic knowledge, right? What is Shariah and why does it matter? What does the Bible actually say about gay marriage? You\u2019ve told me that some of the things \u2014 some of the pieces that get passed around the most are about Scripture. Yeah. (Laughter) Tell me about that. I mean, what gets passed around? Isn\u2019t that amazing? Well, tell \u2014 yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s, you know, we started doing these pieces where it was, you know, what does the Bible say about women? What is the Bible? You know, one of the biggest pieces to date is this piece that said the five things you should know about the Bible. You know, it\u2019s very important for me to have intelligent voices about what Scripture is, to have a piece about Shariah law. We\u2019re talking about Shariah all the time as if we know what it is, so we\u2019d better know what it is. So to get the foremost scholar on Shariah to write a piece about it so that we can actually have an intelligent conversation about it, I mean, you have to know. One of the traditions that I love from the Brandeis household was they would be having a conversation and, if they didn\u2019t know a fact, they would actually stop and look it up before they continued, whereas my tendency \u2026 And they didn\u2019t even have iPads, right? No, they didn\u2019t have an iPad. They would actually go to the encyclopedia. You know, it\u2019s really very funny. Our tendency is just to go, OK, well, whatever. Let\u2019s keep going. I mean, the opportunity here with the Internet is that, if you know how to sift through a lot of the garbage that\u2019s on the Internet, you can find real knowledge and that\u2019s part of what my job, I feel. This ministry, the reason I\u2019m doing this is it feels like a calling, is to push as much positive, as much productive, as much intelligent information out into the Web as possible. What else has surprised you, either that\u2019s come in or that people have read and commented on and passed around in that online world? Well, I think what\u2019s been interesting for me, we do have all these comments that come in and very kind of vicious. It\u2019s like a very sort of mean \u2026 Kind of a big contrast between the high tone of the blog pieces and the low tone of the commentary. The bite that happens on the comments. But what was interesting for me personally to experience was when I had the tragedy and my nephew died and it was just a heartrending thing and I published the eulogy I gave in honor of Sam. He was a young man, right, 20? Yeah, he was 20. I mean, it was just awful. I made myself vulnerable, it\u2019s very clear, and the comments were so amazing because they were talking about people who they\u2019d lost. Then there was this one person who wrote, like, \u201CWell, I\u2019m sorry about your nephew, but you know God is a fairy tale and you shouldn\u2019t. \u2026\u201D and the rest of the commenters all kind of ganged up on him. They said, \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D So there is a soul out there. I think what\u2019s been interesting for other pieces like that, when people are vulnerable, people will pass it along and say, \u201CDid you see this?\u201D because we\u2019re all hurting, left, right, it doesn\u2019t matter. People hurt, people go through pain, people are looking for some sense that they\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s not just kind of, you know, knowledge or kind of ideas. It\u2019s also about the truth of life, the truth of what people are going through. And if you can convey that, I think it\u2019s respected on the Web. It\u2019s interesting. I mean, you hear a lot about the Web as this free-for-all. I mean, that\u2019s it too much information, I mean, it\u2019s open to an extreme. But I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve heard people talking about vulnerability online. And I wonder if you think maybe that \u2014 because say one thing I really treasure in religious traditions that I think is in contrast to our culture is that they actually honor human vulnerability and, you know, meet us there and ask us to make sense there. Do you think that it\u2019s because of the subject matter of Huffington Post Religion that maybe something special in terms of people showing vulnerability and responding to it online becomes possible? That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. I mean, I think of prayer services where people say, you know what, I\u2019ve lost my job and I just need prayer. When I worked at Riverside, we would have prayer services like that. So what I would like, you know, is for people to have that sense of meeting someone there, even if they\u2019re not of the same religion, even if they don\u2019t agree on many social issues. I want people to actually feel like there\u2019s a basic humanity to the site. We had an ongoing series. Every day, this imam wrote about Ramadan and about what he was going through and about the thoughts and the difficulties and all this kind of stuff, and it was very personal and very beautiful. I was following it and I was just like, wow, this is such an insight into someone else\u2019s heart that is from a completely different religious tradition than mine, and it felt like an honor to be able to read it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today: \u201COccupying the Gospel,\u201D with Huffington Post Religion editor Paul Raushenbush. What do you feel, what have you learned, what new sense or ideas do you have about American religious life, not politics, but the religious life in this country? How has this experience of Huffington Post Religion, of working on this online, in fact, creating a new space for this, what do you know now or what feels more important to you that you didn\u2019t see before, didn\u2019t grasp before? I think how eager everyone is to be on the same page. To be on the same page. Not thinking the same thing, but being together on the same page. I see (laughter). On the same page, yeah. Yeah. By page, I mean the Huffington Post Religion, yeah. You know what I\u2019m saying? Yeah. So, you know, I kind of intentionally made that a little confusing because I think we see this around questions of, you know, what\u2019s the role of pluralism in American society? How are we going to understand our Muslim neighbors? How are we going to deal with the true humanity of gay people? You know, all of these things that are in the mix. I see how much, you know, the Sikhs, the Hindus, the Buddhists say, \u201CEverybody is kind of looking to have a voice, to be a part of a general conversation.\u201D I\u2019m hoping that that actually reflects what\u2019s going on in America. But I think that, in some ways, there is a question there. Are there some people who just, you know, kind of refuse to be in the same space as people who they view as other? But, you know, I think something that\u2019s worth teasing out is, you know, when you say on the same page, I think it can \u2014 not this new online way, but the old way \u2014 it can suggest agreement and it can suggest at least kind of a surface agreement that may not be very rich or interesting. But one of the emphases for you, I mean, I think personally as well as an editor, is that you really \u2014 and maybe this the Walter Rauschenbusch gene in you also \u2014 that you really want people to be grounded in their texts and traditions. And so, I mean, it\u2019s interesting that you can create this diverse space, but there\u2019s so much going on that is about that kind of grounding in one\u2019s own beliefs as well as, as you said, the curiosity about others and that there\u2019s no contradiction there. No, no. In fact, I\u2019m always \u2014 it\u2019s very funny because I\u2019m always saying, \u201CThis is really interesting, but could you make it more religion-y?\u201D Right. Uh, you know, like could you really, like, I think people, you know, sometimes when people approach me initially, they think they have to kind of erase out the specificity in order to make it kind of OK for everyone, I\u2019m like, \u201CNo, no, no. It\u2019ll be much more interesting for everyone if you go deep into what your specific tradition is.\u201D That\u2019ll be a much more interesting read for me. I want to know actually what the Hindu roots of your understanding of life or loss. I really want you to reference the richness of your tradition so that I can learn. So I\u2019m always kind of going, you know, it\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s very funny. People are surprised, but that\u2019s my standard line: \u201CThis is good, but it could be a little more religion-y\u201D (laughter). And by religion-y, I just mean go deep into your tradition. Don\u2019t be shy about it. And I think one of the sad things, I guess, about my own kind of upbringing \u2014 and this is not my parents\u2019 fault, believe me. I\u2019m the one who skipped confirmation. But how, um \u2026 But maybe generationally. It may be generation, but I do, you know, I think that the idea of going deep into Scripture, going deep into tradition and finding its richness is something that I want to make sure that the main-line church, which is my tradition, make sure that they appreciate how important it is to know the Bible, to get deep into the Bible, to know the great thinkers, the great sages, the great wisdom teachers of our own tradition. Then you can go out and be conversant when you talk to a Jewish person who has done the same thing in their tradition. It\u2019ll make the conversation way more interesting. It\u2019s exciting and, again, it goes back to this curiosity, curiosity about the other, but curiosity about where you come from, learning from your grandparents. What\u2019s the intellectual tradition you come from? What\u2019s the spiritual tradition you come from? And just to speak to that eagerness too, I just remember looking at, say, for example, a video piece you did where you just went out on the street and you asked people about prayer, right? About their prayer life? What was the question you asked? Oh, I just said, \u201CWhat do you think about prayer?\u201D Yeah, and how do you pray? That was the follow-up. You know, basically, I just was like, \u201CHey, what do you think about prayer?\u201D What was so interesting is how people engaged that question, right? So differently, yeah. So there is the fact that we haven\u2019t known how to talk about this and we haven\u2019t talked about it, but like when you just walked up to people and asked that simple question, they were absolutely ready to go there with you and shared much more than I expected in every case. Oh, yeah, and there was so much more that, of course, we couldn\u2019t include like always. But it was just \u2014 it was amazing and you just kind of sensed that people wanted to talk for a long time about it, and that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s walking around with, a kind of hunger to have this conversation about what\u2019s dear to them. And even if it\u2019s not dear to them, you know, like \u201CI don\u2019t pray.\u201D Like one person was just like she wanted to talk. She was like, \u201CI don\u2019t pray. I\u2019m agnostic, but I think it\u2019s this.\u201D You know, it was very beautiful. It was like an engagement with an idea and people have a lot to say. We have so much to learn from one another. I wanted to quote you some lines of your great-grandfather Walter Rauschenbusch, whom we started out talking about. \u201CReligion is a tremendous generator of self-sacrificing action.\u201D \u201CIf the hydraulic force of religion could be turned toward conduct, there is nothing which it cannot accomplish.\u201D I really like that. I\u2019ve thought and I\u2019ve said openly, so Christian voices in particular re-entered public life and political life in a big way in this country a few decades ago, but it\u2019s not associated with conduct. It\u2019s associated with issues. But I wondered, I mean, when you hear those lines about this hydraulic force of religion, if it could be turned toward conduct, there\u2019s nothing which it could not accomplish. Do you believe that? And what does that suggest to you? What would you like to see that look like? I think it\u2019s such an interesting quote. And I guess, for me, part of the history is following the trajectory from Rauschenbusch to Niebuhr to King, as well as seeing, you know, the divergence of people who left and then came back. Part of what I see today is, you know, the power of religion is not just about like the hydraulic push, but it\u2019s also in some ways to hold back. How does religion force me not to seek out more things, more power, more money? I think, in some ways, what he was talking about there is that religion has a power to make us put other things in front of our own drive towards accumulation, drive towards me, me, me. And so the power of religion in some ways is to choose not to do it, whether that\u2019s, \u201CI will not pick up a gun.\u201D \u201CI will not destroy the environment.\u201D I will not bully.\u201D You know what I mean? The power of religion is to actually offer a transcendent vision of what\u2019s more than just me, what\u2019s more than just my own needs and my own goals and to say actually I have to look at this with a bigger vision. For Rauschenbusch and for me, it\u2019s still what does the Kingdom of Heaven look like? What is a wider vision that will allow me to live my life in accordance with a higher ethic? And religion can do that. It can help people. You know, part of the effort here is to figure out how navigate the religious voice so that it really does that in a responsible way and a way that is beneficial to everyone. I know that, in that letter in February 2010 where you introduced Huffington Post Religion, you also \u2014 and since then you\u2019ve talked about wanting it to be a place where religious and nonreligious people can in fact interact and that nonreligious are ethical and moral beings as well. Has that happened and do you see that as, you know, something that\u2019s also evolving at this point as we move through the 21st century? That some of these important ethical discussions are also happening across that divide, not different religious people, but religious and nonreligious? Absolutely. I see the idea that religious people have some sort of monopoly on morality is absurd. But, again, you know, the question is, OK, so where does your morality come from? Again, I bring in my cousin, Richard Rorty, who had such a clear sense of where he was coming from and what he was drawing upon. He was a secular atheist. He was a secular humanist and, frankly, a boogeyman for a lot of the Religious Right. But, you know, he cared so deeply about people and the pragmatist tradition and how we are going to get better and how we\u2019re going to keep moving forward, and that was someone who I just wanted to work side by side. I wish I could do half of what he accomplished. And so there\u2019s the opportunity here to really learn from one another and to really grow. I have something to learn from the pragmatist philosophical tradition. You know, a great friend of mine and mentor is Cornel West, who also came out of that tradition, was a student of Dick Rorty\u2019s. So he\u2019s someone who is a professing Christian and also a pragmatist. We have much to learn from one another. So how has this experience so far, this interactive online religious life that you live and foster, you know, how is it \u2014 I think this is a very hard question to answer. I hate it when people ask me this, but I\u2019m going to do it to you anyway . Great. How does it flow into your sense of faith and your \u2014 you know, how has it changed your sense of the places religion faith in our common life? You know, I\u2019m not kind of a journalist. That\u2019s not my primary sense of who I am. My primary sense of who I am is as a minister. So but how does it affect me personally is kind of a harder question. It\u2019s hard because you realize how much is out there and, in some ways, like all day long, I\u2019m reading opinions about what people think about the world and about the ultimate questions. What I have to be on guard against, and I think we all do, is kind of saying, OK, yeah, that\u2019s just that. You know, kind of, in some ways, making it too simple, when these things are so complex. So what I have to remember is that all of it represents lives, and I have to make sure that I\u2019m taking care of myself and I\u2019m being a part of some sort of spiritual community or tradition so that it doesn\u2019t just become sort of process the information. It becomes actually like remembering that each one of these people is a child of God, you know, honoring them with what they have to say. But it\u2019s tough because it\u2019s a very fast-paced place. You know, I have to be very careful about how I approach it and keep my soul steady . Paul Brandeis Raushenbush is the Senior Religion Editor for the Huffington Post. He edited Christianity and the Social Crisis in the 21st Century \u2014 a hundredth anniversary edition of his great-grandfather Walter Rauschenbusch\u2019s classic text of the Social Gospel movement. The final chapter of that book includes these lines: \u201CThe Kingdom is always but coming. It is true that any effort at social regeneration is dogged by perpetual relapse and doomed forever to fall short of its aim. But the same is true of our personal efforts to live a Christian life; it is true also of every local church, and of the history of the Church at large. Whatever argument would demand the postponement of social regeneration to a future era will equally demand the postponement of personal holiness to a future life.\u201D We talked about Huffington Post Religion this hour, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that there\u2019s a growing sphere of religion news and discussion online, with a vast array of viewpoints and approaches. Here are some of our favorites: CNN\u2019s Belief Blog, Christianity Today, USA Today\u2018s Faith & Reason, Religion Dispatches, and The Revealer. I\u2019ve contributed to a few of these as well as the Huffington Post.
