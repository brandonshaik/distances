  "fullText": "We\u2019ve heard a lot about Black Lives Matter, but you may never have heard one of its co-founders reflect outside a moment of crisis, presenting a luminous vision of the resilient world we\u2019re making now. I met Patrisse Cullors, who is also an artist, in a cross-generational conversation with Dr. Robert Ross. He\u2019s a physician and a leader who is helping redefine public health in terms of human wholeness. They give voice to the generative potential in this moment we inhabit \u2014 its courage and creativity, its seeds in trauma and resilience, and its possibility for all of our growth as individuals and community. You see the light that comes inside of people to other communities that are like, \u201CI\u2019m going to stand on the side of black lives.\u201D You see people literally transforming. And that\u2019s a different type of work. And for me, that is a spiritual work. It\u2019s a healing work. And human to human, if you take a moment to be with somebody, to understand the pains they\u2019re going through, you get to transform yourself. I think what Black Lives Matter is a living case study about is about narrative change and framing. Because then it leads to, \u201COK, if black lives matter, then what does it mean for schools?\u201D \u201CIf black lives matter, then what does it mean for police reform?\u201D \u201CIf black lives matter, what does it mean for economic development and jobs?\u201D And so it leads to a whole host of, \u201COK, so if that\u2019s true, what does that mean?\u201D I think for those of us in my generation, Patrisse, who are in charge of stuff, it challenges us to rethink our frames and pick different kinds of fights. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. My conversation with Patrisse Cullors and Robert Ross took place in 2016 with an invited audience of social change and nonprofit leaders. We\u2019re at the Los Angeles headquarters of the California Endowment, which Dr. Ross leads. We most often grapple publicly, I think, when it comes to Black Lives Matter and our whole encounter with racial and social inequity, in terms of news events and violent injustice and political and legal actions. And I\u2019m sure we will touch on those things in this conversation. But what we\u2019re also trying to do at the same time this morning is carve out a space to explore human and spiritual underpinnings and promise in these things. And so I want to start with a little bit \u2014 just hearing a little bit about the spiritual ground and formation of each of your early lives and focus that on what you would now \u2014 perhaps not then, but now \u2014 call experiences of trauma and resilience that were seeds of the passion for addressing these things that you\u2019re now bringing to all of us. And Patrisse, I want to start with you. You grew up here in Los Angeles in the 1990s. Born and raised. Born and raised. Yeah. So where does your mind go if you think about the spiritual underpinnings of your life as they had to do with what you would now call trauma and resilience? I love this question. We don\u2019t get asked these things a lot in our movement. But, one, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for having me on, and thank you, California Endowment, for inviting me. And for me, I feel like I\u2019m not just bringing myself, but I\u2019m bringing the movement into this conversation. I\u2019m bringing my ancestors into this conversation. And my great-grandmother, Jenny Endsley, who would\u2019ve been 103 just a couple days ago, is a deep reminder for me around why I do this work. She raised me and my three other siblings while my mom had to work three jobs to barely get food on our table. And she was both Choctaw, Blackfoot, and African American, grew up in Oklahoma. Her father was a medicine man. And she told us lots of stories about the KKK, lots of stories of her father defending their family against the KKK, and her eventual move to Los Angeles. And she was probably one of the most glamorous women I ever met. She had hundreds of wigs in her closet and lots of sequins, and she was this amazing singer and had such a powerful impact on me and my siblings and my family\u2019s life because she stood up for black life so fiercely throughout her lifetime. And that looked like being a part of the NAACP; it looked like picking up her black grandchildren all the time from after-school programs; it looked like helping my mom navigate a system that was consistently trying to separate her from her children. And so those are sort of my early years of understanding my own formation here in Los Angeles. And then my grandmother was the first person to put me on stage. I wrote a speech, \u201CIf I Were President,\u201D when I was in second grade, during the first Bush administration. And she would always ask me, \u201CWhat did you do in school today, grandbaby?\u201D And I read the speech to her, and she was like, \u201COh, well, I\u2019m going to have you read that speech at the women\u2019s club.\u201D And I remember getting on stage at 9, reading this speech, \u201CIf I Were President,\u201D her giving me this trophy, and it was just this moment where I was like, \u201COh, someone believes in me. Someone believes in what I have to offer.\u201D And I think what we forget when we are raising young black children is that the belief in them is absolutely necessary in building their own spiritual foundation and their own fortitude. And I believe if I didn\u2019t have my great grandmother, who deeply believed in me and my siblings, I would not actually be who I am today. That story is so wonderful, and I love that the question elicited a whole different answer because that story you just told about your grandmother and her glamour and that belief and that beauty and courage, strength was against a backdrop, which is the story I\u2019ve heard more often, of growing up in Los Angeles in the 1990s in a neighborhood full of crack addicts and crackdown, which, as you said, had essentially criminalized poverty and the effects of poverty. But it\u2019s that both/and is what brought us you now. Yes. And I think it\u2019s important in this current historical moment that we\u2019re naming the tragedy and the resilience. So the tragedy is black people are being killed often and continue to be killed often. The tragedy is that black people are living in poverty. Black folks have the highest rate of homelessness. Those are the tragedies, but there is this \u2014 also this other side, which is this amazing movement that is challenging age-old racism and discrimination. And I always tell audiences what a great time to be alive to show up for this current historical moment. Yeah. So Bob, you grew up in the South Bronx, and I don\u2019t know a lot about your upbringing. How would you start to talk about the formative seeds for your passion about trauma and resilience? Sure, yeah. Patrisse, by the way, do you still have that speech that you wrote in the second grade? I don\u2019t know if I still have it. I would love to see it. Yeah, so, my upbringing, a bicultural upbringing, my father\u2019s African-American. My mother\u2019s Puerto Rican. We grew up in the South Bronx at a time when it was \u2014 still is a challenged community. My mother was \u2014 at the time, I didn\u2019t realize she was a community organizer, but she was. I mean, in retrospect, I now know she was a neighborhood organizer, and she would rally neighbors and residents to, for example, try and take back this vacant lot that the kids used to play in and had glass and rocks and litter and try and take it back as a park for the kids \u2014 for us kids and try and shoo away the drug dealers from the park. And so my brothers and I thought she was just this nosy busybody, but\u2026 Which is what made old-fashioned neighborhoods healthy. Exactly. Little did I know that she was teaching me a lot about what my work would look like. I would say, for me, the spiritual pivot, if you will, that\u2019s related to the work that I do \u2014 my staff has heard me say this \u2014 you mentioned crack cocaine. When I was a practicing pediatrician in the mid \u201880s, late \u201880s, early 1990s in Camden, New Jersey and in North Philadelphia is when crack cocaine came to the United States, when crack cocaine came to neighborhoods like \u2014 communities like Detroit and Los Angeles and New York. It was an awakening for me in a couple of fronts. One, before 1984, poor people couldn\u2019t buy cocaine. Crack cocaine gets \u2014 some evil genius comes up with crack. All of a sudden, the euphoric, short-acting passport to nirvana known as crack cocaine hit neighborhoods and communities. And for five bucks, you could buy your way into euphoria and into hope. But it\u2019s a very short-acting, 20-minute drug, and then you have to get at it over and over and over again. So that got introduced into inner city communities, and it had a substantive impact on my experience in the community as a pediatrician and a healer because now we\u2019re seeing youth violence go through the roof, gun violence go through the roof, massive increases in property crimes and personal crimes, mothers, pregnant mothers and young mothers, forgetting that they were actually mothers and parents of children as a result of being addicted to crack, attending a lot of deliveries of crack babies. And I was being introduced to what we call later the \u201Csocial determinants of health,\u201D the roles that poverty and hopelessness and housing and lack of jobs all play in wellness, in health and healing. I don\u2019t know when you were born, but how did the Civil Rights Movement intersect with your coming of age and your consciousness about these things? Yeah. I feel like I\u2019m in the lost generation, which is why \u2014 so it was my parents\u2019 generation who weathered the Depression, defeated Hitler, brought the Civil Rights Movement. So, on my dad\u2019s watch and my parents\u2019 watch, they did all that, OK? Which was as much in the \u201850s as the \u201860s, although we tend to think of it as the \u201860s, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I came in at the tail end of the Civil Rights Movement, enough to remember Martin Luther King on television, but not marching. I was too young. And so I feel our generation has pretty much dropped the ball. I\u2019m curious for both of you about \u2014 so we are remembering our own history. I also wonder how you think about ways in which that movement and all it stood for, if there are things we are only now able to appropriate. I mean, I think about W.E.B. Du Bois saying, \u201CThe problem of the 20th century is the color line.\u201D What we didn\u2019t know in the 20th century, what we know now through science is that there\u2019s also a color line in our heads. So that even as we pass laws and most of us, the vast majority of us, decided that racism was wrong and bad and didn\u2019t apply to us, we still continued to behave in ways that didn\u2019t sync with that. And I wonder how \u2014 to both of you again, are there ways you think we are able now to rise to this occasion, that we have some \u2014 that what tools do we have, what knowledge do we have that they didn\u2019t to live into that vision? One blink reaction to that question, Krista, is what this generation has that we didn\u2019t have: social media. Yeah, right. A movement that started with a hashtag or a new narrative that started with a hashtag. And you mentioned a term, \u201Cnarrative change.\u201D So I think what Black Lives Matter is a living case study about is about narrative change and framing. Because then it leads to, \u201COK, if black lives matter, then what does it mean for schools?\u201D \u201CIf black lives matter, then what does it mean for police reform?\u201D \u201CIf black lives matter, what does it mean for economic development and jobs?\u201D And so it leads to a whole host of, \u201COK, so if that\u2019s true, what does that mean?\u201D And I think for those of us in my generation, Patrisse, who are in charge of stuff, it challenges us to rethink our frames and pick different kinds of fights. I would argue the same thing: social media. I don\u2019t believe social media is the end all be all, but what it has allowed for is a new generation to speak from their own perspective. It\u2019s allowed for a new conversation, new reach. I think a new generation of anti-racism white allies have been really important in this conversation. And I remember specifically after the acquittal of George Zimmerman how many anti-racist white folks wrote stories about their own whiteness and their relationship to it. And it was this powerful conversation with sort of like the public in this vulnerable way around how people are continually behaving and supporting anti-black racism by their own behavior. And when Mike Brown was murdered, we saw another round where whole communities, non-black POC communities in particular, coming out and saying, \u201CYou know what? My community is deeply anti-black, and I want to challenge that.\u201D And so we get to see a new generation speak for ourselves through social media, through online platforms. We\u2019re living in the era of people writing blogs all the time. And social media accounts, although sometimes really self-absorbed, can be really self-reflective, and I think it\u2019s powerful. It also presents a whole different model for how social change happens. I think most of us, at the end of the 20th century, would\u2019ve thought social change is about large numbers of people on the streets, charismatic leaders, and that is how it worked. But this is much less leader-centric. It\u2019s a network of change. It\u2019s also amorphous, right? I mean, and I know you hear this, and I also want to ask you \u2014 when there\u2019s criticism of Black Lives Matters, that rage is out front. And when people compare the Civil Rights Movement of 50 years ago with Black Lives Matter, they say \u201CWhere is the love?\u201D And I want to talk about love in a minute, because I don\u2019t want to just throw that word out there because it\u2019s a big, robust word. But there are dialogues, like, between Ta-Nehisi Coates and Cornel West about \u2014 it\u2019s not just Black Lives Matter, but is \u2014 if rage is at the center, what is being created in terms of building a different world? So how do you respond to that discomfort? Well, I disagree. It\u2019s both rage and love at the center of our work, I think. From the beginning, Alicia Garza\u2019s \u201CLove Note\u201D to black people that ended with, \u201COur lives matter, black lives matter,\u201D it was from a place of rage, but also from a place of deep love for black people. And I think that \u2014 when we show up on the freeway, when we chain ourselves to each other, that\u2019s an act of love. That act of resistance is an act of love, that we will put our bodies on the line for our community and really for this country. In changing black lives, we change all lives. And I think that\u2019s the conversation that needs to be penetrated into folks, right? This conversation about black lives mattering is a conversation about all lives mattering, and I think that our work shows as such. When we have actions of people \u2014 have they ever been a part of a Black Lives Matter action \u2014 it\u2019s deeply spiritual. It\u2019s often led by opening prayer. Folks are usually sage-ing. We use a lot of indigenous practices. People build altars to people who have passed. And so it\u2019s this moment to both stand face-to-face with law enforcement, but it\u2019s also this moment to be deeply reflective on the people who\u2019ve been killed by the state and give them our honor. It\u2019s an honor to protest for them. So many of our people, names have been lost, and so we\u2019ve said, \u201CWe will not forget you. This protest will keep you remembered.\u201D And Sandra Bland was a perfect example. When she was arguably killed inside a jail cell, we said, we will not forget your name, because so often the names are forgotten. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors and physician and California Endowment President Robert Ross. I think this is a tricky conversation to have because \u2014 one thing you\u2019ve said is \u201CBlack Lives Matter\u201D \u2014 and this was probably a moment \u2014 \u201CBlack Lives Matter at this moment is about exposing.\u201D And that is what has been so galvanizing. So \u2014 I have a 17-year-old son who\u2019s a white boy, and there was a killing in Minneapolis. He talked to me about how he heard news from Baltimore and St. Louis and Los Angeles and New York and thought that doesn\u2019t happen here. And then there was a vigil at his school and all these kids \u2014 he goes to a great big urban high school. All these kids he\u2019s been at school with for years stood up and told stories about things that had happened to them. It was completely shocking to him, things like what happened to you in your childhood \u2014 their fathers being dragged out of their houses and taken to prison. So this \u201Cexposing\u201D \u2014 this is pretty amazing. I don\u2019t think you can put this back in the box. And it was in a box, and that\u2019s what we realized. Yes, a tight one. Yeah, I was \u2014 I mean, it was in the box for a part \u2014 there\u2019s two Americas. For those of us who\u2019ve lived in it, it was not in a box. We were experiencing it on a daily basis. It\u2019s been trying to expose it to the America that has kept it in the box and that has been able to have the privilege to not witness, to not go through. I think now that that\u2019s been exposed to the other America, you can\u2019t put that back in. There\u2019s no turning back. To your question, Krista \u2014 and I\u2019m not a scholar in the history of social movements and activism. It\u2019s not what I do. I try to learn. We try to learn. But in the moment and at the time, the activists are employing a form of strategic outrage, right? Yes. And at the time and at the moment, they\u2019re always criticized, marginalized, targeted for being outrageous, right? I mean, Martin Luther King is now on a stamp, and it\u2019s a holiday, and there are parades. And as you mentioned earlier, Patrisse, he was detested\u2026 Yes. Yes. \u2026in many circles during his time, as was Gandhi, as was Mandela, put in jail for 27 years, and it was just fine, thank you. And so, if you\u2019re not being accused of being outrageous, then you\u2019re probably not successfully deploying activism, is one point. The second point, which I hope we get to \u2014 I just want to tease it \u2014 the science on the trauma side and what it does to us is a lot better developed than the resiliency side, but there is something about civic activism and engagement that appears to be powerfully immunizing against poor health. We know there\u2019s something quite holistically health-supporting. Life-giving. And life-giving when those young people are engaged. Mm-hmm. And you\u2019ve both spoken about how young people, in particular, experience injustice with an immediacy and a rawness, take it in in a way that \u2014 to varying degrees we learn or try to learn to shield ourselves as we get older. So let\u2019s talk about love. Love was a pivotal, essential word in that original Civil Rights Movement, I think, even for King and everyone around him, but also Malcolm X in the end. But it was a complex, robust vision of love, right? And that language of the \u201Cbeloved community,\u201D which is what everything was aiming towards, was also full of biblical imagery. I heard something that I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about. At the American Academy of Religion meeting this year, which is, like, 12,000 theologians, Ruby Sales, one of these women whose name we don\u2019t remember, talked about how \u2014 she said, \u201CNone of us considered ourselves to be religious in the way our parents or grandparents were and there was a lot of religion, but we were rejecting so much of what we\u2019d grown up with. We didn\u2019t think that defined us. And we only realized later that even though that was true, we were steeped in that tradition, in the hope, in the sense of love, in the songs, in the community. We had our armor on.\u201D And she said, \u201CAnd then we became involved in policy, and we sent our children out into the empire without their armor on.\u201D And I\u2019d love to know how you hear that and think about it. I love that. I love that she said that. I think we think about it differently. I mean, to be honest with you, so many of us in the Black Lives Matter movement have either been pushed out of the church because many of us are queer and out, many of us \u2014 the church has become very patriarchal for us as women and so that\u2019s not necessarily where we have found our solace. And I think we have had to contend with that during this movement. How do we relate to the black church and how do we understand ourselves in relationship to the black church inside of this movement? But that hasn\u2019t stopped us from being deeply spiritual in this work. And I think, for us, that looks like healing justice work, the role of healing justice, which is a term that was created probably about seven or eight years ago and was really looking at how, as organizers, but also as people that are marginalized that are impacted by racism and patriarchy, that are impacted by white supremacy, how do we show up in this work as our whole selves? How do we be in it as our best selves? And how do we look at the work of healing? I\u2019m really appreciative that Dr. Ross calls himself a healer because I believe that this work of Black Lives Matter is actually healing work. It\u2019s not just about policy. It\u2019s why, I think, some people get so confused by us. They\u2019re like, \u201CWhere\u2019s the policy?\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CYou can\u2019t policy your racism away.\u201D We no longer have Jim Crow laws, but we still have Jim Crow hate. Yeah. But see, that, I think, is a new insight. Right? I just don\u2019t think they knew that 50 years ago. Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. I think when there are laws on the books that are so hateful, of course our first instinct is to get rid of those laws, transform those laws, reform those laws. But there\u2019s something much deeper inside of us that causes our behavior to be biased or discriminatory. And to me, racism is a sickness. If we\u2019re approaching racism and sexism and homophobia as sicknesses, you\u2019re not just gonna think, \u201CWell, if someone writes standards over and over again, \u201CI will no longer be racist, I will no longer be racist,\u201D that it\u2019s going to change them. No, it takes something else. It takes a sort of exorcism. I deeply believe that. And you see it in people\u2019s transformation in this work. In the last year and a half, from the black community in and of itself, as we say \u201Cblack lives matter,\u201D and sort of you see the light that comes inside of people to other communities that are like, \u201CI\u2019m going to stand on the side of black lives,\u201D you see people literally transforming. And that\u2019s a different type of work. And for me, that is a spiritual work. It\u2019s a healing work, and we don\u2019t have it codified. There\u2019s no science to it. Really, it\u2019s \u2014 we are social creatures. Human to human, if you take a moment to be with somebody, to understand the pains they\u2019re going through, you get to transform yourself. And I think the last thing I\u2019ll say is Black Lives Matter is a rehumanizing project. We\u2019ve lived in a place that has literally allowed for us to believe and center only black death. We\u2019ve forgotten how to imagine black life. Literally, whole human beings have been rendered to die prematurely, rendered to be sick, and we\u2019ve allowed for that. Our imagination has only allowed for us to understand black people as a dying people. We have to change that. That\u2019s our collective imagination. Someone imagined handcuffs; someone imagined guns; someone imagined a jail cell. Well, how do we imagine something different that actually centers black people, that sees them in the future? Let\u2019s imagine something different. Ms. Tippet: You can listen again and share this conversation with Patrisse Cullors and Robert Ross through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in a cross-generational conversation about the courageous, resilient world we\u2019re making now, with artist and Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors and physician and public health leader Robert Ross. We\u2019re at the Los Angeles headquarters of the California Endowment, which Dr. Ross leads. Bob, I want to pull you into this in a minute. I do want to give a shout out. Diane Winston is here from USC, and actually, the only place I saw writing about the spiritual aspect of Black Lives Matter was in Religion Dispatches. Did you see that piece? Yes, of course I did. It was terrific and they \u2026 It was wonderful. It was just telling \u2014 it said, \u201CWhen you think of the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, you may think of Ferguson, you may think of Baltimore, you may think of \u2018I Can\u2019t Breathe.\u2019\u201D It goes on and talks about this aspect of the movement, and it says, \u201CBlack Lives Matter\u2019s chapters and affiliated groups are expressing a type of spiritual practice that makes use of the language of health and wellness to impart meaning, heal grief and trauma, combat burnout,\u201D \u2014 which the original Civil Rights leaders will tell you they weren\u2019t good at \u2014 \u201Cand encourage organizational efficiency.\u201D And, Bob, it seems to me that this also, again, it gets at what the work you and California Endowment are doing with trauma and resilience. Working with that is precisely in the same field. You\u2019ve written about the old saying that time heals all wounds is simply not true. \u201CNot these wounds.\u201D Yeah. And what we struggle with, as a private health foundation, we want to be disciplined and anchored in what the science says about improving public health and well-being, right? And so now we\u2019re talking about love and justice and movements, and it makes our heads spin. How do we connect? Well, and it\u2019s the narrative of those things doesn\u2019t allow for such words, or it\u2019s uncomfortable with such words. It is \u2014 we\u2019re getting increasingly comfortable with it. We\u2019re beginning to get over ourselves, I think, as many of our grantees notice. So a couple of quick sort of concrete examples of how the love thing plays out in the work that we do. Many of the folks that are here in the audience worked with young people on the school discipline reform, zero tolerance, school suspension issue, which came to us from the mouths of young people themselves, was not on our radar screen as a health foundation. They said, \u201CWe want you to help us get rid of zero tolerance.\u201D We said, \u201CWhat are you talking about?\u201D As a parent, I\u2019m thinking zero tolerance is a good thing for schools, isn\u2019t it? They said, \u201CNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the portal to the incarceration super highway.\u201D But what they were also saying to us that the science and the research bears out in terms of their experience is, think about the message you are sending to a young person who is acting out in school, for whatever reason or however you defined \u201Cacting out,\u201D and you suspend them or expel them out of school. If that is not the opposite of love, I don\u2019t know what is. Exactly, right. Right? That is an act of unlove, right? Right. And then the data, if you\u2019re suspended one time, even one time, you have a two to three times likelihood of being involved with the incarceration system, of dropping out of school. I think you also say that in the juvenile justice system, there is, in fact, no question \u2014 no interrogation of is there trauma in this life? Exactly. I mean, so there\u2019s a movement now, and I\u2019m sure Black Lives Matter is \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re absolutely at least familiar with this if not part of the platform, Patrisse \u2014 why do we have juvenile incarceration at all, period? For anybody in this country, right? And so, again, we are criminalizing sick, traumatized, oppressed children early. This is powerfully spiritual, important work upon which the future of this nation rests, and I think it calls upon us to bring the best of the total experience of our best selves to the table. It\u2019s not \u2014 we can\u2019t mail it in on addressing inequality in this nation. Each of us is going to have to bring the best of ourselves to the equation. Not just the best of ourselves, but the best of ourselves in unity and in coalition. OK. So if you have questions, why don\u2019t you write them down, and then we\u2019ll open it up. Hello, and thank you so much for the jewels of wisdom that you\u2019ve brought. My question is, someone said to me recently and it really resonated, that the system is without a soul. And in the midst of your work, especially around pushing policy, how do you suggest that we bring some spirit back into the system? Yeah, that\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s very personal when you\u2019re working on these fights that your life has been impacted by. And I think \u2014 I\u2019m not clear if the system can gain a soul. I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s what their purpose is. But what I think we must do is not lose our own because it is very easy when you\u2019re fighting big systems who crush whole communities to feel like, \u201CWell, what\u2019s the point?\u201D And I think the point is \u2014 although a victory is amazing, let me tell you. I\u2019ve had some victories, and that feels good. The point isn\u2019t necessarily the victory. The point is building the power of our communities, and that looks like the organizing. It looks like what it takes to have those conversations. It\u2019s the door-knocking. It\u2019s the community meetings. It\u2019s the idea that we had the audacity to imagine something different for ourselves. I think the Civil Rights Movement talked about it a lot, right? We might not see these things in our lifetime, but if it\u2019s about something bigger than us, then we\u2019re going to stay in it for the long haul because the hope is 100, 200 years from now, this place will still be in existence, and that we will have left it better off. I\u2019d like to know your thoughts about reparations? Do you want to talk about\u2026 No. OK. I want to hear what you have to say. Yeah, I\u2019m a strong believer in reparations. I\u2019ll specifically talk about the community of Flint right now. If any community in this moment in history needs and deserves reparations, it\u2019s that community. We have no idea what the long-term impacts of a community who have been ingesting lead for two plus years is going to have, not just on them, but our entire country. We can\u2019t separate ourselves from Flint. We can\u2019t separate ourselves from Detroit. And so I think \u2014 I\u2019m a firm believer in sort of global reparations, but I do want to sort of specifically talk about Flint and the crisis that exists. And just reading article after article and talking to the community organizers down there, it\u2019s desperate. It\u2019s in these moments where I sort of scoff at the language that we\u2019re living in this \u201Cland of the free,\u201D where everything is possible for us. And then you sort of zoom into Flint, and you\u2019re like, \u201CExcuse me?\u201D 60 percent black, mostly poor, and now lead poisoning? I mean, tragic. And so, yeah, I think there\u2019s a huge argument for why that community in particular deserves reparations. Others? I\u2019m the rector of a small church in Altadena, beginning to wake up and wanting to engage in the work of healing and hope with the oppressed in our immediate community. What would each of you say is the first best step? You go. OK. I love Altadena. Thanks for being in the room. I think the first best step would be hosting a community meeting and seeing where folks \u2014 how this movement, current movement is landing on people. What are people feeling most impacted by in the city of Altadena? What are people\u2019s needs? We have a Black Lives Matter chapter in Pasadena who\u2019s doing great, great work, and I know that you\u2019re neighboring cities and towns, and it would be good to even maybe have, like, a community meeting with Black Lives Matter Pasadena members who is interested in having a broader conversation. I\u2019m a big fan \u2014 I think part of what I miss the most in the work \u2014 because I don\u2019t get to do it as much as I used to because I live on a plane most of the time \u2014 is sitting with people and just listening and listening to what folks care about the most, what needs aren\u2019t being met, and take it from there. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, at the California Endowment with its president Robert Ross and Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. We\u2019re taking questions from the invited audience of non-profit and social change leaders. There was one more. John Lewis will be in town, I think, tomorrow, attending a prayer breakfast. And if you had an opportunity to meet with him prior to his address, what would be one thing that you would praise him for? And then what would be one thing that you would ask him to do or to say or to address? I want to meet him. I would praise him for setting such a remarkable standard for what it means to show up for black life during his lifetime and his ability to stay the course. Yeah, I think that would be, like, \u201CThank you.\u201D Like, deep, deep gratitude. And then the second thing I would ask for is, \u201CCome train us.\u201D I think people think that Black Lives Matter leaders and members don\u2019t want to be \u2014 want mentors. We do. We want mentors. We want elders that were part of the Civil Rights Movement to train us. We don\u2019t want them to tell us what to do, but we want training. We want to be talked to. We want to be in conversation. I had the pleasure of meeting with Sekou Odinga in a similar intergenerational conversation, the brother that was incarcerated from the Panther party. He was incarcerated when Assata Shakur was incarcerated. And it was one of the most beautiful exchanges, and it was just us looking at each other and him being like, \u201CThank you,\u201D and me being like, \u201CThank you,\u201D and dropping some wisdom specifically around surveillance and the role surveillance played in his movement, and now it\u2019s playing in ours. And we need deep mentorship, and I would love if the older generation would show up for us in that way. That\u2019s a wonderful question and a wonderful answer. Do you have questions of each other as we draw to a close, anything you\u2019d want to ask? I have one. OK. What has inspired you to be in the work that you\u2019re currently in, and what are you feeling most inspired by, by this current movement? I\u2019m a very patriotic American. OK, I understand that patriotism has been ideologically handcuffed these days. But I love the idea of this nation and its promise. And for those of you that \u2014 I\u2019m going to take you back to maybe a painful moment when you were in college and you had to read Democracy In America by Tocqueville. It\u2019s like, \u201COh my god.\u201D But in the last third of Democracy In America, Tocqueville describes \u2014 and it was interesting because he\u2019s this French sociologist. He comes to America in the 1800s, and back then, in Europe, monarchs and kings and queens ran stuff. The people didn\u2019t run anything. And so he comes to America saying, \u201CWhat\u2019s up with this?\u201D And ostensibly, he comes interestingly to study our prison system, which is another interesting tidbit. And he gets \u2014 OK, there\u2019s a president, and there\u2019s a Congress and \u2014 remember the three branches of government from high school Civics 101 that we all learned. And then he recognizes there\u2019s this thing that happens off the org chart that\u2019s pretty powerful, where Americans come together and using their voice \u2014 come together to solve problems through executing on their own agency. And they don\u2019t wait for permission from the king or the queen or even the Congress to do it. And so what keeps me going is when I see and we see the most marginalized, the most oppressed, the most stigmatized exercising agency and voice and power to change systems. That\u2019s pretty heady stuff. That\u2019s spiritual, right? That\u2019s \u2014 I mean, I go to church on Sunday, but I go to church when I visit the organizations we support. So, for me, that has been inspiring, is inspiring today, continues to be inspiring for me. I was gonna ask a final question, which Dr. Ross has just answered, which is what makes you despair, and what gives you hope right now? And when you talked about trauma, that was your despair, and you\u2019ve just given us this really beautiful moment of hope. And so Patrisse, I want to end by asking you right now, in this moment, what makes you despair? Where are you finding your hope? I think the despair is definitely in knowing that we aren\u2019t currently living the dream that we have dreamt for black lives that \u2014 I think there was something I put on social media the other day that it\u2019s intense when the very movement you started isn\u2019t necessarily translating to supporting your own family. When you\u2019re fighting the criminal justice system, and your nephew just caught a case \u2014 18-year-old nephew, just turned 18. We successfully were able to keep him out of juvenile hall, but now he just caught a case, and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s difficult, and it tugs at me. What else could I be doing? What more can I be doing? But the hope is \u2014 for me, the hope lies in the movement, the mass movement, the folks who are unapologetic, and our love for black life and black people, our consistency. Folks did not think we would last this long. I think people are now being like, \u201COh, I guess we really got to deal with these people.\u201D And that feels good. I joined this work because I was angry and depressed and did not feel hopeful, and it was in this work where I found a deep sense of faith and resilience and possibility. And so my nephew can catch a case, but he knows that his auntie is not gonna let him go out like that. And so we bring our community together to help raise money so he can get a private attorney, so we can fight as much as we can fight and get him the best deal possible. And then we show up back on front lines and try to fight bigger enemies. And so literally, my hope comes in this fight. I think I always have \u2014 everything becomes a campaign to me, whether it\u2019s in my family or in my life. I\u2019m like, \u201CHow do we make this a campaign?\u201D And I think those tools have been absolutely necessary for my own health and wellness. It\u2019s been a great honor and also very nourishing to be part of this conversation today. Bob, you spoke a minute ago about being our best selves, and culturally, we\u2019re a lot better at dwelling on what\u2019s going wrong, but we want to be called to our best selves. And the work you\u2019re doing here is aspirational, and Black Lives Matter is aspirational, and so I just want to thank you for being part \u2014 and I\u2019m really \u2014 thank everybody in this room because I think everybody in this room is part of this work of calling ourselves and our communities to their best, and in so doing, helping make that happen. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Krista. Dr. Robert K. Ross is president and chief executive officer for the California Endowment.
