  "fullText": "\u201CWe are going to Mars for the same reason Marco Polo rocketed to China, / For the same reason Columbus trimmed his sails on a dream of spices, / For the very same reason Shackleton was enchanted with penguins, / For the reason we fall in love, / It\u2019s the only adventure.\u201D Nikki Giovanni is one of our most beloved poets \u2014 and I had such fun interviewing her, she is utterly at home in herself. She\u2019s a teacher at Virginia Tech, where she brought beauty and courage by way of poetry after the 2007 shooting there. She was a revolutionary poet of the Black Arts Movement that nourished civil rights. As Ebony magazine describes her, \u201CShe has been there to chronicle the Black experience and interpret it for us in words we could understand and feel.\u201D Today Nikki Giovanni is a self-proclaimed space freak and a delighted elder \u2014 an adored voice to hip hop artists and the new forms of social change this generation is creating. You are enjoying being in your 70s, I sense. I do. I recommend it. I do I love it. And I love how you are just continuing to wrestle and change your mind and your vision is just constantly evolving. But everybody\u2019s is. The only difference between me and most people is that I\u2019m not afraid to talk about it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Nikki Giovanni has received numerous awards for her books of poetry and her works for children. She is a Distinguished Professor in the English Department at Virginia Tech, where she has taught since 1987. One of the most striking things that just jumped out of me all the way through your writing and writing about you, and all the way to the latest volume of poetry you published in 2013, is how from the very beginning you were held and cherished and taught by courageous, loving women. Yeah. Your mother \u2014 you were named \u2014 your first name is Yolande, right? You were kind of named after\u2026 Yeah, it used to be \u2014 when mommy passed, I had it legally changed to Nikki just because that\u2019s what everybody knows me. I would\u2019ve never done it when mommy was here\u2026 I see. \u2026 \u2019cause I wouldn\u2019t want her to think I didn\u2019t want to carry her name. I\u2019m Yolande, Jr. Yeah. And so how old were you when you changed your name legally then? Oh, mommy\u2019s been dead ten years so I was 62, something like that, 63 years old. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And how do you say your grandmother\u2019s name. Louvenia, Louvenia? Louvenia. Uh-huh. Louvenia. But everybody actually calls her Emma Lou. OK. Emma Louvenia Watson. Also that you were all, sounds like, foodies before the name \u2014 the word had been invented. Oh, definitely. Grandmother was a foodie and grandmother\u2019s friends were foodies. And, of course, I ended up living with grandmother. Not ended up, but was fortunate to live with grandmother. So mommy was a good cook because she was grandmother\u2019s daughter and my aunt Ann was a good cook. Living with grandmother, I learned all of their tricks. My favorite was, of course, her greens and I\u2019m still, still, still working on that because working on that \u2014 because making greens is one of life\u2019s difficulties. It looks like you just clean them and stuff. Well, mommy \u2014 well, and grandmother, too, you pull the stems and then you tie the stems and you put the leaves in and you use the stems to flavor and then you pull it out. And so she was very good at that. But the other thing I was laughing and then I\u2019m laughing about this \u2014 you didn\u2019t ask me about this, but in grandmother\u2019s day, you used to go to the market and you bought a live chicken. Actually, grandpapa did the marketing and he would bring it home and then they\u2019d put it in the backyard. And then, grandmother would go out Saturday morning and wring its neck. Yeah, yeah. But, you learn to do that, and I guess have learned, too. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m dealing with on another kind of level. But for something to live, something else usually dies. There\u2019s a transition. And it\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s not something I would\u2019ve been able even to say to you at even 50 years ago in my 20s. I wouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s really a \u2014 it\u2019s been interesting. You were born in 1943, is that right? Mm-hmm. Yes. And so you grew up in \u2014 I like this. You talk a lot about what we call the \u201960s, what is called the \u201960s, which you really date from about 1954 to 1968, which was such a dramatic moment. I mean, a lot of transition. I mean, you\u2019ve just been using that word. One question I ask people, whoever I\u2019m talking to usually, is how would you describe the religious and spiritual background of your childhood? And I wonder how you would start to talk about that and I really mean the fullness of that \u2014 your family, but also that world that you came into. First of all, I grew up, of course, Baptist, \u2019cause grandmother was a Baptist, Mt. Zion Baptist Church. But when mommy married our \u2014 my father married \u2014 we called him Gus. We called daddy Gus. When mommy married Gus, they moved to Cincinnati because he couldn\u2019t get a job. He was a college graduate and he couldn\u2019t get a job in Knoxville, and so they moved to Cincinnati where he could get a job. And mommy joined the AME Church. But if we\u2019re just gonna just kind of breeze on religion without getting into anybody\u2019s business, I recently have been fascinated with why it is that we don\u2019t actually look into the manger more. We always look at the cross. And I think that one of the problems with the manger is that we have to give Mary credit for bringing God to Earth. And the book that I\u2019m working on right now, actually, is called A Good Cry, and it\u2019s just because I realize women keep a lot of things in them. I do know this from Mary and I\u2019m gonna give Mary credit, having a baby hurts. I don\u2019t care who it is or where it came from, having a baby hurts, so I want to give Mary her props. And I also want to deal with the fact that as we are giving this birth, a part of what the Christian religion is supposed to do is give birth to a new human being. You asked one kind of question. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m answering it strangely, but \u2026 No, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s \u2014 I think this question lands wherever in us it wants to be given voice. I mean, you also once said \u2014 you said you always think it must\u2019ve been a woman who developed the spiritual. Oh, gosh, yes. When we look at slavery, which, actually, slavery is only going to be the end result, we have to look at the kidnapping in Africa. We have to look at \u2014 no matter what the country. We have to look at the fact that somebody sold and somebody purchased and that just cannot be denied. We\u2019re upset, of course, with the Europeans because we say, oh, they created slavery. They might have. But they didn\u2019t create the buying and selling of human beings. That had been going on for quite some time all over. So we had the people coming across that ocean not knowing where they were going, but knowing whatever it was, they were not gonna go back to where they used to be, so somehow or another, they had to make a decision, how do we go forward? But it had to be a woman because \u2014 we\u2019re back to the manger. We\u2019re back to Mary. We\u2019re back to that\u2019s what women do. It had to be a woman who said, I need to settle my people down and when you consider\u2026 OK, yeah. \u2026there were a lot of languages going on. She didn\u2019t speak English at that point. They didn\u2019t speak Swahili at that point. There were many languages. The only common language is going to be . So when we get to what is going to ultimately become the United States, these people had created a way to speak to themselves, to each other, through the language, through spirituals. Yeah. So when you were 25, you wrote, \u201CI\u2019m 25 years old, a revolutionary poet. I love.\u201D I do. I kind of want to ask you about the \u201CI love\u201D tacked on at the end of the sentence, but I also want to ask you about what you meant at 25 when you said you were a revolutionary poet, and how you look at that now, as Nikki Giovanni, quite a few years later. Well, I think 25 was good. But I always thought 25 was one fourth of my life and I felt the same way at 50. I don\u2019t feel the same way at 70. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ll make 75, but I always felt like, OK, this is a fourth of my life. What am I doing and what am I trying to do? Well, a part of what I\u2019m doing is articulating. I would be \u2014 if I would be unfortunate enough, if I can say it like that, to be on that ship, I would be the person who started the song because somebody has to raise a voice. Somebody has to raise \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the word is. It\u2019s not just courage, but the foresight or something to say, we have to talk, and this is how we\u2019re going to \u2026 Or the soul of a poet, maybe. Somebody has to have the soul of a poet. Sure. That works for me. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 that song had to come from someplace and I would like to think that if I were on that ship, I would raise that song. But since I\u2019m not, I\u2019m \u2014 at 25, I\u2019m at a turning point in America, and we had to raise our voice to say \u201Cit is now time! Middle passage is just over. This is segregation \u2014 It\u2019s time that we moved into a new world, a new generation.\u201D And, of course, I had the great pleasure, ultimately, of knowing Mrs. Parks. But it was so \u2026 Rosa Parks. Yes. It was so important that somebody stand up. I didn\u2019t know Thurgood Marshall. Wouldn\u2019t it have been wonderful to have had a glass of wine with Thurgood? Yes. Oh, my goodness. What a brilliant, brilliant man. Yeah. So I came up at a time that I thought I could be of some use that my voice could be of some use. I\u2019m not strong. I\u2019m not fast. I don\u2019t have any talents. I\u2019m not that pretty, you know. So all of the things that one normally thinks about women and what they should do, I really don\u2019t do it, but I am smart. And so I thought, what I have to do is use my smarts to be of some service to human beings. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the poet Nikki Giovanni. I\u2019m curious about \u2014 and this a huge question, but I\u2019m so curious about what you might share about how you\u2019re inhabiting this moment now. And as a grandmother of a young woman who\u2019s going to be growing up in this world and even an adult son and \u2014 I\u2019ve also been watching, on YouTube, these interviews that a lot of great, young, black hip hop people and actors and entertainers do with you and the reverence. Like, they look up to you. And so I\u2019m curious about the conversation you\u2019re having inside yourself and also with your friends and across generations about what you lived through and participated in in the \u201960s. And 50 years later \u2014 so where \u2014 how that helped you make sense of now or critique now or worry or be proud or hopeful about where we are now. I actually think of myself as the quintessential existentialist. So I live now. And one of my either great strengths or great faults, I haven\u2019t figured out and I probably won\u2019t, is that I don\u2019t go back. I don\u2019t reread poetry like that. I don\u2019t rethink myself. I just try to bring the best that I have today. I\u2019m incredibly thrilled that the youngsters \u2014 I have a \u201Cthug life\u201D tattoo on my arm and when I get a minute, I\u2019m gonna put another. I said I was only gonna have one tattoo, but I\u2019m gonna put another tattoo as soon as I come back, actually, from vacation and it\u2019s gonna say \u201CHokies Don\u2019t Hate,\u201D because I think that that\u2019s \u2014 that was important and I think that \u2026 And the Hokies is the \u2014 what\u2019s the \u2026 Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know. What do you say? Their nickname. When we had the situation in Paris \u2014 people were picking on the Muslims and the community, the Virginia Tech community, had a big rally on the drill field, and they gave out bands. I don\u2019t have it on right now, but the band said \u201CHokies Don\u2019t Hate.\u201D And I thought, yeah, next to Thug Life, that\u2019s the next statement that I think is important to make. Hokies Don\u2019t Hate. I\u2019m, as I say, I am incredibly thrilled that the youngsters look at my work and look at some of the things that I\u2019ve done and they\u2019ve found some good in it. I like to think, essentially, I\u2019m fertilizer, and so they\u2019re growing something. Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t meddle. I really don\u2019t. And I get asked \u2014 I\u2019m 72 so I get asked, well, what do you think the kids should do today? And I don\u2019t know what the kids should do today. They know what they should do today. I like Black Lives Matter. I think that that\u2019s important. I have the button: \u201CI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201D \u2014 I think that that\u2019s important. Not just because of the gentleman, but because if we don\u2019t let the air be free, none of us can breathe. But they don\u2019t need me to tell them what to do. They\u2019re perfectly capable and I think they\u2019re doing an incredibly good job. But, we\u2019re just all living in this world at this time and one of the great thrills of my life is I\u2019m a space freak. I\u2019m an Appalachian. I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, grew up in Cincinnati, and I\u2019m now here. I was in New York for 20 years or so, but I am now here in Roanoke, Virginia, so I\u2019ve spent most of my life in Appalachia. We are used to the quiet and we are used to looking at the star \u2014 in my opinion, looking at the stars, dreaming. And if we\u2019re gonna really go into space, we really need two things, if I may say so like that. We need \u2014 well, actually we need black people. We need really, really more black people involved, and we need wine. And we have to find a way to deal with the wine. And if we can do that, then you can spend 500 days going up to Mars and you can be sane when you get there. You see what I\u2019m saying? Yeah, I do. So it\u2019s a \u2014 at the very beginning of your book, of the Chasing Utopia book, you just tell this quick story about interviewing Mae Jemison who was the first black woman to go into space. And that\u2019s such a great story. You asked her how did she avoid getting bored. And what she said, I pay attention. Or what did she say? Boredom. I can\u2019t remember. Do you remember what her \u2026? I\u2019m not looking at it in front of me. But Mae Jemison\u2019s a great kid. I called Essence magazine and I\u2019ve been knowing Essence forever. I remember they started. And when they said Mae Jemison was going into space, I called Essence and I said, listen, this is \u2014 I want you to understand so that they\u2019ll be no misunderstanding. I interview Mae Jemison. I\u2019m gonna come down there and all of you will be sorry. And they said, OK, Nikki, you can do it. And I was so pleased. And Mae did that. She paid attention. But Mae did not have 500 days. And we might get it down to 400, but that\u2019s a little over a year to sit on a spaceship. And she, you know \u2014 you\u2019re not gonna have any sex. You know what I mean? The things that you would normally do within a year, you\u2019re not gonna have it. And so what we have to do is find a way and find the people who are used to being within themselves. You also connect these things to your aspiration and imagination about the black connection to the future of planet Earth. How do all these \u2026? Sure. And it\u2019s also \u2014 it goes back to \u2014 let me interrupt you for a minute. Yeah. It goes back to Middle Passage, because if you can survive that journey from west coast of Africa to the east coast of the United States and be sane when you get here \u2014 and that\u2019s what we haven\u2019t looked at. And so, again, a part of my research that I\u2019m trying to do now and hopefully, I\u2019ll live long enough to get more done than I\u2019ve been doing, though I\u2019m working on it, a part of my research is that we have not dealt with the fact that they were sane when they got here. I just wrote a poem and I said \u2014 one of the lines in the poem said, \u201CPluto will one day be another \u2014 will be a planet and we\u2019re gonna send black kids up there to learn how to ski.\u201D And I love it. It\u2019s \u2014 we have got to quit dealing now \u2014 race was a bad idea 200 years ago, 300 years ago. It\u2019s a ridiculous idea today. Hatred was a bad idea and it\u2019s a ridiculous idea today. We\u2019re on the third planet from yellow sun. We have got to come together to see \u2014 and how do we make sense out of this, and how do we find a way to bring the sanity into this? How do we find a way to make the best of us? \u201CWe are going to Mars because whatever is wrong with us will not get right with us so we journey forth, carrying the same baggage / But every now and then leaving one little bitty thing behind. / One day looking for prejudice to slip, / One day looking for hatred to tumble by the wayside, / Maybe one day the Jewish community will be at rest, the Christian community will be content, the Muslim community will be at peace / And all the rest of us will get great meals at holy days and learn new songs and sing in harmony. / We are going to Mars because it gives us a reason to change.\u201D I was thinking as I was reading, your passion about space, that you\u2019re such a space freak, as you say. Have you ever heard of this language of the \u201Coverview effect?\u201D It\u2019s actually a documented effect of something that happens to astronauts, people who have been in space, that they get this sense of perspective that is kind of life-altering that changes the way they then come back to culture. Have you ever heard of that? No, I didn\u2019t. I mean, here\u2019s one way somebody described it. It says \u2014 it refers to \u201Cthe experience of seeing firsthand the reality of the earth and space, which is immediately understood to be a tiny, fragile ball of life hanging in a void, shielded and nourished by a paper thin atmosphere. From space, national boundaries vanish. The conflicts that divide people become less important and the need to create a planetary society with the united will to protect this pale blue dot becomes both obvious and imperative.\u201D I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, but that\u2019s\u2026 Yes. Is it? And said much better, but that is exactly. Can you imagine when we have people doing sort of a normal, oh, what are you going to do next weekend, John? Well, you know, Mary and I were thinking, you know, we\u2019d just run up to this space station and have a glass of champagne and we\u2019ll spend the night and we\u2019ll be back. Can you imagine sex in space? I have to confess I\u2019ve never thought about it before. All right. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you. No, no, you didn\u2019t. I just \u2014 I think we have to return to Earth here for a little while in this conversation, though. I mean, we were talking about the spirituals before. And that kind of lead into this, the question of how people stay sane, and not just sane, but bring beauty into the world, and the spirituals as such an incredible demonstration of that. Oh, yeah. I mean, you also mention Virginia Tech and I want to come back to that terrible massacre in 2007, and you did deliver a poem that day. And to me, when I read it and hear it again \u2014 the spirit of the spirituals is in it, which is about facing reality head-on and including, right \u2014 those spirituals were called sorrow songs, right? And you said, \u201CWe are Virginia Tech. We are sad today and will be \u2014 we will be sad for quite a while. We are not moving on. We are embracing our mourning. We are Virginia Tech. We are strong enough to stand tall tearlessly. We are brave enough to bend to cry and we are sad enough to know that we must laugh again.\u201D When \u2014 Sandy Smith is the president\u2019s \u2014 Dr. Steger\u2019s assistant \u2014 called me and, everybody \u2014 I knew Mr. Cho, I knew the murderer and I knew some of the students who were killed. I know that Mr. Cho \u2014 I had kicked him out of my class and that\u2019s a longer story, but people \u2014 some people said, was he after you? But I\u2019m never in class \u2014 I\u2019m never on campus on Monday, so I knew Mr. Cho wasn\u2019t looking for me. He was doing something else. And so when Sandy Smith called me, she said, Nikki, we need you to anchor convocation. I knew that I was incredibly sad. Actually, I\u2019m tearing up right now and I apologize. Anybody that knows me knows that, I\u2019m pretty good on my feet, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t walk into an auditorium as sad as I was and \u2014 I just didn\u2019t want to trust myself to do the right thing. So I just sat down and wrote what was important. And what was important to me was that we are Virginia Tech. Not what happened. \u201CWe are Virginia Tech. / We are sad today, and we will be sad for quite a while. We are not moving on, we are embracing our mourning. / We are Virginia Tech. / We are strong enough to stand tall tearlessly, we are brave enough to bend to cry, and we are sad enough to know that we must laugh again. We are Virginia Tech. / We do not understand this tragedy. We know we did nothing to deserve it, but neither does a child in Africa dying of AIDS, neither do the invisible children walking the night away to avoid being captured by the rogue army, neither does the baby elephant watching his community being devastated for ivory, neither does the Mexican child looking for fresh water, neither does the Appalachian infant killed in the middle of the night in his crib in the home his father built with his own hands being run over by a boulder because the land was destabilized. No one deserves a tragedy. / We are Virginia Tech. / The Hokie Nation embraces our own and reaches out with open heart and hands to those who offer their hearts and minds. We are strong, and brave, and innocent, and unafraid. We are better than we think and not quite what we want to be. We are alive to the imaginations and the possibilities. We will continue to invent the future through our blood and tears and through all the sadness. / We are the Hokies. / We will prevail. / We will prevail. / We will prevail. / We are Virginia Tech.\u201D And it was an incredible poem. And also, what was so striking to me and telling about what you do and about who we are as human beings is \u2014 there was just the incredible applause and then whoever stood up next, and I don\u2019t know if it was the president, said, \u201CBoy, did we need that.\u201D I don\u2019t remember. I was just glad that I was able to do that. Yeah. And if you think about poetry and the place of poetry and \u2014 in human life and also in common life \u2014 and how it\u2019s something we forget, but it kind of resurfaces again and again. And I felt like that moment after that terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech and, you, as a poet, saying \u201CWe will prevail.\u201D There was this authority of that form of language. I wonder how surprised you might have been, that 25-year-old revolutionary poet that there are moments when we honor poetry and poets and understand how necessary it is. Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Even now, to be honest, and I say this to my students, I don\u2019t \u2014 my students are too young to understand that you don\u2019t plan your life. And the life of a poet is not planned. You\u2019re just always doing \u2014 well, we\u2019re back to cooking. You\u2019re always doing the best that you can do, and you\u2019re always taking whatever ingredients you\u2019re given and making whatever it is that you can make. Am I making sense? Yeah. And so being a black American, and I don\u2019t mean to bring race in like that, but being a black American, I\u2019m used to taking little bits of this, that, and the other. My grandmother did not waste. There was nothing that came into her kitchen that she didn\u2019t find a use for. And I feel the same way with experience and with words. And as I have grown older, I refuse to let who I was at 25 inform or make me be who somebody else thinks I should be at 72. And I think that this is what maybe the young rappers \u2014 Jill Scott called me the other day and it was really just such a pleasure to talk to that young lady. But what I was at Jill\u2019s age, I\u2019m not now. I\u2019m learning something. I\u2019m looking again at slavery, and I\u2019m going to look at it very differently because I\u2019ve learned so much. I\u2019m not a novelist, and I have good friends who are novelists, and I\u2019m always laughing at, you novelists, you sit down and you say, this is what I\u2019m going to write, because this was a bestseller. But we don\u2019t do that. Poets don\u2019t have bestsellers. I\u2019ve had a couple, but it\u2019s been an accident, nobody knows why, but poetry is not on that level. So we\u2019re always trying to just tell the truth as we understand it, and I want my students to understand that. You have a voice, use it. Never let anybody take your voice away from you. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. And don\u2019t waste \u2014 I\u2019ll go back to that \u2014 don\u2019t waste what you know. You\u2019d be surprised at how many people actually waste what they know, not to mention waste what they feel. Would you say a little bit more about what you \u2014 your reflections that you had in that conversation about how you\u2019re thinking about slavery now in ways that you didn\u2019t think about it before? Well, We all know \u2014 let me approach it this way if you don\u2019t mind. OK. We all know Rosa Parks, and we all know Mrs. Parks refused to give up \u2014 Mr. Blake said to her, \u201CI want you all to give up this seat.\u201D It was the four of them sitting there. And Mrs. Parks, who was sitting on the aisle, and there was a man on the window and two people across. Mrs. Parks, said, \u201CNo.\u201D She got up to let the man on the window out and she sat back down. What I ask my students, and what I\u2019m sharing with you, is what did the white man who was standing there think when he saw this woman standing up by sitting down for herself? Who was he? We\u2019ve never looked at who was he, and what were his thoughts? And so when you say, as I look into slavery, well we know that there were victims in slavery. I don\u2019t have any problem with that, but we also know that something good came out of slavery, because we in black America became Americans. Because we \u2014 no matter what Marcus Garvey or any of the rest say, there is no \u201Cback to.\u201D This is it for us, because we have no place to go back. I\u2019m \u2014 what is it fifth generation American, something like that. I\u2019d have to do the math. But there\u2019s no place to go back. So it\u2019s not unusual for somebody like me to be in love with something like Mars, because all my people have ever done is go forward. We go forward with a sanity and a love. I think that that\u2019s so important that planet earth tap into that. Quit playing these little stupid race games, and find out what it is that these people are bringing to all of us as we go forward. \u201CThis is not a poem\u2026 No\u2026It is a celebration of the road we have traveled\u2026It is a prayer\u2026for the roads yet to come\u2026This is an explosion\u2026The original Big Bang\u2026that makes the world a hopeful\u2026loving place / This is the Black woman\u2026in all our trouble and glory\u2026in all our past history and future forbearance\u2026in all that ever made love a possibility\u2026This is about us\u2026giving pride\u2026giving succor\u2026giving voice\u2026giving encouragement\u2026giving whatever\u2026we can give / This is about us\u2026celebrating ourselves\u2026And a well deserved honor it is\u2026Light the candles\u2026This is a rocket\u2026.let\u2019s ride.\u201D You can listen again and share this conversation with Nikki Giovanni through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the poet Nikki Giovanni. She was part of the Black Arts Movement that nourished civil rights, and she engaged her revolutionary poetic voice in a famous dialogue with James Baldwin in Paris in 1971. Now, she\u2019s a professor at Virginia Tech, where she brought beauty and courage by way of poetry after the shooting there. And she\u2019s an adored voice to the hip hop artists of today and the new forms of social change this generation is creating. One thing that just runs all the way through a picture \u2014 getting a picture of your life is that you have been loved well, you were loved well in the beginning, and you\u2019ve loved well. There\u2019s these famous lines from some of your early poetry that \u201CBlack love is Black wealth and they\u2019ll / probably talk about my hard childhood / and never understand that / all the while I was quite happy.\u201D I mean you just use the word \u201Clove\u201D \u2014 does that word, how does that word figure in as you think about a vision for us as human beings, in terms of race and beyond race in this world that you\u2019d like to see us be creating? Love is important. I think my father was an idiot and no \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 my father was an idiot. He was abusive, right? He was violent. Yeah, he was. And I don\u2019t know what \u2014 I couldn\u2019t begin to tell you what made me understand that whatever was going on with Gus had nothing to do with how mommy felt about me and felt about Gary. Gus was crazy, but he loved us. So I think it was Toni Morrison that said, \u201CLove is no better than the lover.\u201D Crazy people love crazily. OK, yeah. And I think she\u2019s absolutely right. And I don\u2019t know what let me separate so that I didn\u2019t learn to dislike him. I just didn\u2019t let that which does not suit me determine who I am. And I feel the same way and I think that we\u2019re looking at young black youngsters and young white youngsters today \u2014 I say that to my students, because I have white youngsters, they didn\u2019t create slavery. Yeah. So there\u2019s no reason for them to feel guilty about it. What we all need to do is decide how we want to go forward \u2014 am I making sense? \u2014 from this. Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m going to be sorry when I retire, because I enjoy \u2014 if it\u2019s one thing that I definitely enjoy it\u2019s my 8:00 class. My 8:00 class, they come to me \u2014 8:00 AM\u2014 from their dreams, and I come to them from mine. And I would give up a lot of things in terms of teaching, I really don\u2019t want to give up my 8:00, because I like the freshness that they bring. And the other word would be, I like the love that we have for each other as we come into that class. And I think that you have to make up your mind what you are going to love. And the other day I had the pleasure, the absolute pleasure of having okra made with chicken feet. And I hadn\u2019t had chicken feet since, oh, since I lived with grandmother. She\u2019s been dead a long time. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I just sat there. I wanted to lick the bowl. It was so good. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever had okra, which \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever had chicken feet, because nobody does it. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve had chicken feet. I haven\u2019t had okra with it. I do love okra, but I haven\u2019t had it with chicken feet. Oh, my. It was so wonderful. Is that kind of where your mind and heart go when you\u2019re thinking about love, it ends up with food? Is that\u2026 Yeah, if I had a choice between food and sex to remember, I always remember the food. The sex wasn\u2019t bad in some cases, but the food was always wonderful. So you\u2019re saying love is a great thing, and also it\u2019s not always healthy, and so it\u2019s not necessarily that useful to throw it around as a word. Well, I \u2014 no, you can\u2019t just throw it around. I think you have to make up your mind what you love and what loves you. And I think that\u2019s a two-way street. And I think you have to be patient with your love. All love doesn\u2019t work, we know that, whether it\u2019s food, whether that\u2019s a human being, whether that\u2019s a dog, whether that\u2019s the garden you use to grow, I mean, whatever it is, but outgrowing something or not needing it doesn\u2019t make you dislike it. It just means that you\u2019ve learned that lesson. You have earned what it had to offer you. You\u2019ve done that, and now you move on. I\u2019m not married, but I have friends who are divorced, and they was like, it was such a mistake. Well, it wasn\u2019t a mistake, it was a lesson learned. You had 10 good years and you have children and, whatever the house or whatever. But everything is a lesson. And so you have to find out what\u2019s the lesson and how do I embrace this lesson, and how do I go forward? You have to watch out for the bitterness. That\u2019s what you don\u2019t want to be bothered with. \u201CYou were gone / like a fly lighting / on that wall / with a spider in the corner. / You were gone / like last week\u2019s paycheck / for this week\u2019s bills. / You were gone / like the years between / twenty-five and thirty. / As if somehow, / you never existed / and if it wouldn\u2019t be / for the gray hairs / I\u2019d never know that / You had come.\u201D There\u2019s another line I wrote down from your talk with James Baldwin 1973. So one thing you said, \u201COne of the nicest things we created as a generation was just the fact that we could say, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t like white people.\u2019\u201D And then you said, \u201CIt was the beginning, of course, of being able to like them.\u201D Yeah. Which is such an honest\u2026 That makes sense, yeah. That makes total sense, because once you can articulate, once you can get it out, then something else can come back in. It makes total sense. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know what else to say about that. Well, and it seemed helpful to me \u2014 I feel like we\u2019re in this moment \u2014 so much has come to the surface that obviously needed to come to the surface, but we still don\u2019t know quite what to do with it. And I feel like we at this point \u2014 50 years on from the that Civil Rights Movement of Dr. King and all the people of that era, we think we\u2019re supposed to know how to do this, and we don\u2019t. And we don\u2019t know how tell each other the truth or tell ourselves the truth. And so that statement that you made that we could say, \u201CHey I don\u2019t like white people.\u201D It\u2019s so refreshingly true and real. That\u2019s not even really a question, but\u2026 Well, the line you were quoting, \u201CNikki-Rosa,\u201D earlier, and I could push it back from where you were, and the line was, \u201Cand I really hope no white person ever has cause / to write about me / because they never understand / Black love is Black wealth and / they\u2019ll probably talk about my hard childhood / and never understand that / all the while I was quite happy.\u201D And I think that what I\u2019m trying to say \u2014 I don\u2019t want to second guess myself either. But I think what was important to me is that I don\u2019t want to be put into a box. We need stop that old fashioned racism and get back into where we as human beings are going. We really do. Right. I mean, you also are on a college campus a lot, do you think there is something healthy right now about the fact that there\u2019s truth being told and these things that happen are \u2014 they\u2019re being reckoned with, I mean, imperfectly, but that has changed. Do you see that too or do you have it differently? I\u2019m not sure what you mean, when you say \u201Ctruth being told.\u201D Well, that as you wrote in 1988, people get shot and it\u2019s not \u2014 there\u2019s no outcry, there are no marches, there are no sanctions. And now there are pictures and there\u2019s an outcry and there\u2019s sanctions. And we\u2019re not quite sure what to do with it. But these things aren\u2019t invisible anymore. I just wrote a \u2014 and I\u2019m struggling with it by the way, because I \u2014 it\u2019s on a deadline it happens to be one of the few poems I have on a deadline. Oh, you\u2019re struggling with this piece you are writing. And I\u2019m struggling to make it. But the third line in the poem says, \u201CWe cannot be un-raped.\u201D And I was interested, because, we\u2019ve had a lot of campus rape and then we find out that some of it isn\u2019t quite accurate. But no matter what it is, we cannot un-rape. And I\u2019m not sure \u2014 I\u2019m having this argument with myself. I don\u2019t know where this is going to go, by the way. But I\u2019m not sure that justice can come from any of that. Only thing that can come from that is revenge, and revenge is a bad idea. I mean, the Greeks learned that 800 million years ago. That justice can come from any of what? That there is no \u2014 if you right now came in here and beat the living crap out of me, there is no justice. There\u2019s no justice. I had the living crap beaten out of me. Right. I can sue you. I can get revenge, but I can\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s no justice. And so I\u2019m beginning to wonder should we change this dialogue we have. And I\u2019m sorry to say it like that I\u2019m not namby-pamby, but we\u2019re going to have to find a way to talk to each other. And I think that that\u2019s what\u2019s important. So I\u2019m \u2014 am I \u2014 I\u2019m probably not making sense. No, you are making sense. I mean, you said a minute ago that we need to work with where we\u2019re going. And it strikes me, and I think that\u2019s also what you are saying here, that there\u2019s the anger and pain at injustice, which is real, and there\u2019s also this other work. If you say that there\u2019s no justice, then there\u2019s this other work of also creating the world we want to live in, which may be so imperfectly tied to righting those wrongs. Or just trying to learn to live with the fact that some things we\u2019re going to say you cannot do. And then some things we\u2019re going to say, but though you have done them, we have to find a way to live with them. And that doesn\u2019t mean we reward you for what you\u2019ve done, but it also means that we need another level of dialogue. I\u2019m a big fan of the Greeks for a lot of reasons. Not because of their \u2014 they have terrible wine, as you know \u2014 but I\u2019m a big fan of the Greeks. But it would have been fun to have lived at the time that you could walk around and talk to Socrates or Aristotle, to somebody, and say, let\u2019s remake the world. My students and I \u2014 \u2019cause we talk about everything, \u2019cause we\u2019re writers \u2014 and we were talking about how there was an imbalance. I don\u2019t have to tell you that. There was a terrible, terrible imbalance in economic privileges. And one of my students, a young man, says that and he says, \u201CWell, what are you going to do?\u201D And I say, \u201CI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. What I\u2019m going to do is tell you that it needs to be changed.\u201D Because it does. The economic system that we live on needs to be changed. And I can\u2019t think of it, because I\u2019m 72 and I\u2019m already stuck with what I am. But the youngsters coming up are going to find another way to handle this. \u201Cchildhood remembrances are always a drag / if you\u2019re Black / you always remember things like living in Woodlawn / with no inside toilet / and if you become famous or something / they never talk about how happy you were to have / your mother / all to yourself and / how good the water felt when you got your bath / from one of those / big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in / and somehow when you talk about home / it never gets across how much you / understood their feelings / as the whole family attended meetings about Hollydale / and even though you remember / your biographers never understand / your father\u2019s pain as he sells his stock / and another dream goes / And though you\u2019re poor it isn\u2019t poverty that / concerns you / and though they fought a lot / it isn\u2019t your father\u2019s drinking that makes any difference / but only that everybody is together and you / and your sister have happy birthdays and very good / Christmases / and I really hope no white person ever has cause / to write about me / because they never understand / Black love is Black wealth and they\u2019ll / probably talk about my hard childhood / and never understand that / all the while I was quite happy\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the poet Nikki Giovanni. You are enjoying being in your 70s, I sense. I do. I recommend it. I do. I love it. And I love how you are just continuing to wrestle and change your mind and ask questions and your vision is just constantly evolving, it seems. But everybody\u2019s is. The only difference between me and most people is that I\u2019m not afraid to talk about it. That\u2019s right, you do. That\u2019s right you talk about it very openly. You know, something \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you wrote this. \u201CThe state of the world we live in is so depressing,\u201D you wrote, \u201Cand this is not because of the reality of the men who run it, but because it just doesn\u2019t have to be that way. The possibilities of life are so great and beautiful that to see less wears the spirit down.\u201D I was at a gathering recently, and the topic of the gathering was \u201COn Beauty,\u201D and actually it was at the Ford Foundation, and I know you have a history with Ford Foundation, because the Ford Foundation sponsored that early entrance program at Fisk, all those years ago, when you went to college. Absolutely. And so it was a gathering of writers, artists, architects, philosophers, psychologists, people working in different fields. And one of the points of contention that we got to in the room was somebody said \u2014 and he was a white man in his 60s, maybe \u2014 said that he thought, he believed that there is a canon of beauty, that there are certain works of art and works of writing that you basically have to be made out of stone not to experience and get shivers and perhaps cry \u2014 be moved by. He was saying that we should take beauty seriously as a cultural good, and that we should have a kind of a canon that children experience and they claim as their own. But this was also controversial, because the idea was that in fact we\u2019ve had an idea in the West that there\u2019s a canon of beauty, and it\u2019s excluded a lot of other people\u2019s sense of what is beautiful and what is meaningful. I wonder how you take in that idea, but also, I think, more importantly \u2014 I\u2019m curious like what would be your canon of beauty? That\u2019s going to be a hard question. Another hour? But I\u2019m not against the canon, let me be really clear about that. I\u2019m not against the canon, because if we give you a canon then you will vary on it. OK. Right. And so I don\u2019t have any problem with that. If, for example I learned \u2014 which I just went to see the other day the \u201CMessiah\u201D \u2014 I don\u2019t have a problem with the canon, because it will change. You build on what you know and I think that it\u2019s up to all of us to say well this is \u2014 this I want you to learn. I want you \u2014 I got no problem with Mona Lisa, this is what I want you to look at, but I also know that there\u2019s Ashley Bryan. And I know that Ashley Bryan and the work that he does, which is so beautiful and he does a lot of work on illustrating the spirituals, I don\u2019t want to exclude. I don\u2019t want some teacher to stand up there and say well, that\u2019s crap, because it\u2019s not the \u2026 Right. Right. You don\u2019t want that. What you want to say is now let\u2019s look at the Mona Lisa and she\u2019s smiling. Why is she smiling? Well, I think she\u2019s probably smiling because she was listening to the Fisk Jubilee Singers and they were singing some beautiful spirituals for her. Right. Do you see what I\u2019m saying? I do. I like it. If I ask you, when you look around the world right now, today, in your 72nd year, where do you see beauty? What gives you hope? What comes to mind? Well, see, I like the people, first of all, I\u2019ve always been fond of the people. I really do of course enjoy the food. I\u2019m an American. And I really, really like what we\u2019re doing in the black communities. I wish we had more resources, because I would like to see the black community having better housing, better schools \u2014 just some basic things that we know they need. But I love what they are doing with rap. I love what they\u2019re doing with the music. I love what they\u2019re doing to bring their spirits up. And I think that that\u2019s \u2014 again, this is something that I think the world benefits from. And of course I\u2019m a fan of travel. So, you want to see everybody traveling back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, and I think that that\u2019s important. I enjoy that. But I also like my friends. I\u2019m just trying to be a good writer. And I\u2019m not trying to change the world, but I\u2019m trying to, when I do say something, trying to make sense out of it. Here\u2019s something you wrote that I loved. You wrote, \u201CWriting is a conversation with reading; a dialogue with thinking.\u201D I really get that too. I get that, actually, that dialogue with thinking, talking to you as well. That that\u2019s how you live. You gotta \u2014 as I say to my students \u2014 and again, I hate to keep referring like that \u2014 but I\u2019m always telling my students, you\u2019re your first reader. So that when you write something, the main person that has to be pleased with it is you. Writers don\u2019t stand on the corner. And it\u2019s important that the young writers realize that. You\u2019re not writing so that you can write a bestseller. You\u2019re not writing so that it can be turned into a movie. You\u2019re not doing any of that. You\u2019re writing to tell the truth, and you\u2019re writing to satisfy that in you that says I have this truth to share. And you have to be proud of that. Well, Nikki Giovanni, I\u2019m glad, very glad that you\u2019ve shared your truth. And it\u2019s been such a pleasure to spend this time with you in conversation. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. It\u2019s been fun. \u201Ci know my upper arms will grow / flabby it\u2019s true / of all the women in my family / i know that the purple veins / like dead fish in the Seine / will dot my legs one day / and my hands will wither while / my hair turns grayish white i know that / one day my teeth will move when / my lips smile / and a flutter of hair will appear / below my nose i hope / my skin doesn\u2019t change to those blotchy / colors / i hope my shoulder finds a head that needs nestling / and my feet find a footstool after a good soaking / with epsom salts / i hope i die / warmed / by the life that i tried / to live\u201D Nikki Giovanni is a Distinguished Professor in the English Department at Virginia Tech.
