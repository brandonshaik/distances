  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CThe Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue.\u201D My guest, Paul Zak, is a leader in the emerging field of neuroeconomics. He helps explain how circumstances can dampen the human inclination towards moral behavior, but he also studies how human and economic interactions are driven by trust and says that can be measured and nourished biochemically. Markets are human creations, and they reflect our own human nature. In the kind of decentralized economies we live in, it is based on trust and faith and belief, and that\u2019s a good thing. I think it recognizes human dignity. It recognizes that most human beings in most situations are moral creatures and you can trust people to reciprocate most of the time and most of our societies are built around that. Civilization is built around that. Certainly democracy is built around that. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. In a few breathtaking months, we\u2019ve culturally moved from seeing Wall Street as an icon of thriving civil society to analogizing its workings with book titles like House of Cards and Animal Spirits. This hour, as part of our ongoing series Repossessing Virtue, we\u2019ll look at what science is learning about trust, fair play, and empathy and what these qualities have to do with human character and economics. My guest, Paul Zak, is a pioneer in the emerging field of neuroeconomics. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue.\u201D Paul Zak is a professor of economics at Claremont Graduate University and founding director of the Center for Neuroeconomic Studies. He is trained in economics, neuroimaging, and mathematics. His research has centered around a powerful hormone that also acts as a neurotransmitter, oxytocin, which has been dubbed \u201Cthe moral molecule.\u201D It is a kind of physiological signature for empathy. Paul Zak\u2019s laboratory has demonstrated that under the right conditions and with the right encouragement, oxytocin drives trustworthy behavior. Only 2 percent of the population, according to his experiments, is innately unresponsive to this physiological stimulus to care about the effects of our actions on others. From those experiments, Paul Zak became interested in the morality of economic decision making, how and where trust comes into that from a neurological perspective. He intensively analyzed the Enron crisis of the early 2000s, finding it a case study for trust gone awry at every level of an enterprise. Early in his career, Paul Zak charted a correlation between trust or lack thereof with poverty or wealth in different countries. I\u2019ve been working on models of conflict to understand why countries don\u2019t grow. So if there\u2019s a lot of conflict politically, socially, even economically, then you see a lot of disruptions and you see a lack of progress made in terms of living standards. And so I had this idea at a conference that if I am such an expert in conflict, I should be an expert in the absence of conflict. And as I started thinking about that, I thought, you know, what captures the essence of conflict is really trust. When trust is high and we can shake hands and do a deal, then my sense was that, you know, economies would grow faster. So delving into that for a couple years, I discovered that trust was sort of the big gun economists have been looking for. It\u2019s really the most powerful lever we\u2019ve found to date to understand why countries are rich or poor, partially because trust captures \u2014 when trust is high, everything in the society works well. The government works well. The social sector works well. The economic sector works well. So it\u2019s sort of one variable that captures, hey, things are going good or things are going badly. And when you say trust, I mean, are you talking about trust in the structures of an economy, trust in markets, trust in other businesspeople? I mean, is this trust as manifest on many levels? So it\u2019s really trust in other people. OK. So it turns out that trust in other people correlates very strongly with trust in government, how well all these other sectors of the economy work. And so once this work became very well known and the World Bank flies me out, you know, \u201CHow do we implement this stuff in these less developed countries?\u201D the question I always got was, \u201CWell, how do two people decide to trust each other?\u201D Because the data we were using were, \u201CHow much do you trust other people in your country in general?\u201D But the next question was, \u201CWhy would I trust a complete stranger and particularly in a tangible way? Why would I give money to a complete stranger, particularly if I\u2019m never going to see him or her again?\u201D And that led to this investigation of the brain mechanisms behind trust and our discovery of oxytocin as this trust molecule. So that is the work you\u2019re doing now, and it comes under this category of neuroeconomics, which I think is a word that many people won\u2019t have heard. So I wonder if you could just tell me, I mean, is that a new field that you\u2019ve helped create? That\u2019s kind of the sense I have. That\u2019s correct. So I started doing this in 2001 and 2002 and there really wasn\u2019t a name for this, although this name was kind of floating around in the air. And neuroeconomics really looks at the brain processes that are active that are present when we make decisions. Now you notice I didn\u2019t economic decisions; I just said decisions. Yeah. So in some sense all decisions are economic; that is, they involve trade-offs. Should I marry girl A or girl B? Should I have three children or two children? So any decision making process involves evaluating alternatives, and that\u2019s really the essence of economics. So because people couldn\u2019t report to us in our laboratory experiments why they were trusting strangers with their own money, which they do quite readily in laboratory, we needed some other way to figure out what they were doing. And so we had this idea to measure brain activity while they were making decisions, and subsequently this field has now kind of taken off and has a life of its own. But at the time it was, you know, sort of the world\u2019s stupidest idea. Well, say some more about that. OK. Because economists assume that people \u2014 when money\u2019s on the line, you know, people are very thoughtful. They will take some time. They\u2019re informed. There\u2019s this sort of big cognitive process that leads to efficient decision making. But in fact, we know from our own lives that sometimes people make mistakes, even people with big brains like us, sometimes we make mistakes. And why is that? Further, I realized we\u2019re taking a shot at traditional economics that assumed that people were thoughtful and slow and deliberative and we don\u2019t see that in the world. Right. We see people making gut decisions, quick decisions, sometimes wrong decisions maybe for the right reasons, but decisions that go horribly wrong. And maybe some of those lead to things like financial crises. Certain booms and busts are not sometimes rational. They are overreactions or underreactions to certain environments. So I think in the environment right now, we\u2019re seeing a gross underreaction to what looks to me like lots of bargains in real estate and various asset classes, because there\u2019s this overwhelming sort of sense of pessimism. And three years ago, there was just way too much euphoria, you know. But backing up a little bit, I do think even though you\u2019ve been doing this work for several years and you and other people in other disciplines, I mean, because it looks like neuroeconomics draws on economic theory as well as neuroscience and psychology, endocrinology. But I think you\u2019re right, and I think that one of the kind of \u2014 there was this shock when the economic crisis hit last fall, because it did seem like we had all been functioning, to some degree against the evidence, on an idea that because we were dealing with economics, which had to do with numbers, somehow it was rational and logical. Right? I mean, many of us had suspended our judgment in different ways. And what was fascinating to me is that suddenly what we were talking about was faith in the markets being crushed and trust in the markets being crushed. Right. So suddenly we were seeing that what was exposed was, you know, you could almost say the human condition. I mean how much emotion and irrationality is always in there. I agree with you completely. You know, markets are human creations, and they reflect our own human nature. And in the kind of decentralized economies we live in, it is based on trust and faith and belief, and that\u2019s a good thing. I think it recognizes human dignity. It recognizes that most human beings in most situations are moral creatures, and you can trust people to reciprocate most of the time. Our studies find 98 percent of people are reciprocators and the 2 percent have very unusual brains, and we can talk a little about that. Yeah. But 98 percent of the time, people will do what you expect them to do. What that means is that we don\u2019t need a policeman and a lawyer in every transaction, and that\u2019s great, because now, just like these high-trust countries that I spoke of before, we can effect transactions quite readily and easily. So the cost in engaging in transactions is lower, more transactions occur, and we have more wealth creation and greater prosperity. There are downsides to that. For example, people will find loopholes and try to exploit them, which certainly people of the finance industry did. But by and large, I think having these decentralized economies that are based on most people most of the time being moral, being reciprocal, means that we can do lots of things we couldn\u2019t do otherwise. And most of our societies are built around that. Civilization is built around that. Certainly democracy is built around that. You wrote: \u201CStudies across several scientific disciplines are accumulating evidence that modern free economies can only function if most people most of the time behave morally. Surprisingly, this research also shows that the freedom to exchange in markets may itself lead to a society where individuals have stronger moral values. Put more succinctly, markets depend on and promote virtue.\u201D Now, that is not the story we would tell ourselves about the reality of the economy as it started to reveal itself to us in the latter months of 2008. Do you feel that what you wrote then, you know, what you have been discerning in your research was wrong? Or was it prescient? I\u2019m going to stick by that. I think, you know, the news is overwhelmingly about stories in which we have failures. I think in that same essay I said even the most ardent capitalists get a small thrill when they see the kind of evildoing CEOs do the perp walk. You know, the Jeffrey Skilling, Kenneth Lay. Right. And we like to see people who have cheated punished. Most of our great novels and movies are about that theme to one extent or another. So by allowing individuals the freedom to engage in transactions without coercion, it also means you\u2019re allowing some people to cheat and it\u2019s that kind of hardcore 2 percent who have a brain dysfunction in this brain chemical that we found instantiates empathy, instantiates care for someone else\u2019s welfare. I\u2019m not saying, by the way, that Jeffrey Skilling doesn\u2019t have this brain mechanism. He may or may not. I haven\u2019t studied him. But we have to allow for some cheating. Think of this as a legal analogy, \u00E0 la sort of Minority Report. If I looked into your head and I figured that in 10 years from now you\u2019re going to engage in some crime and therefore I arrest you now, which who knows? But if I allow you go through your life and if you do engage in misbehavior, then I\u2019ll try to, after the fact, capture you, punish you, encourage you not to do that again \u2014 me being as a society. As a society, we\u2019ll try to do that. But I don\u2019t want to beforehand say, \u201CNo, you can\u2019t engage in all the things in life. You can\u2019t go one mile an hour over the speed limit. Even if you have a sick child in the back seat and you\u2019re rushing him or her to the hospital, it\u2019s not allowed.\u201D So I think by having this freedom to innovate, do things a little differently, perhaps even to bend the rules, allows for greater freedom, greater prosperity, greater innovation. It also allows for cheating, and we need an appropriate regulatory framework that captures, discourages, and punishes cheaters. And I think what we found in this recession is that we didn\u2019t have a sufficiently strong framework within the financial services industry. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue.\u201D Before Bernard Madoff, Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay were icons of a gross violation of the trust of employees, shareholders, government, and customers. But in a book he edited, Moral Markets, Paul Zak also told the lesser-known story of Cliff Baxter. Baxter was a vice chairman of Enron who protested corruption as he saw it grow internally. He resigned his position in 2001, just a few months before Enron\u2019s collapse began. In early 2002, as the human cost of Enron\u2019s excesses unfolded, he apparently committed suicide. By many accounts, Cliff Baxter had a strong moral code. His story is a contrast to generalizations fueled by high-profile coverage of out-of-control corrupt executives. But Paul Zak sees it as an exemplar of the moral inclination for which human physiology equips us, given the right circumstances. So let\u2019s bring some science to bear in this. So I just made a bunch of perhaps interesting or outlandish claims about people having sort of a moral sense. But in the last five years, we\u2019ve begun to find the chemical basis for this. And we\u2019ve discovered this molecule called oxytocin that lives in the human brain, and in particular human beings, it\u2019s particularly potent at making us care about the outcomes of others. So we initially found that when someone trusts you with their money intentionally \u2014 \u201CI\u2019m going to give you $20 and let you control it\u201D \u2014 that the more money someone entrusts to you, the more your brain releases this molecule and the more you tend to reciprocate. When the person says, \u201CWould you like to give some of that back to me,\u201D even though you don\u2019t have to, you do. We\u2019ve now found this substantiates generosity. If I have more, you have less and visa versa. When we give people, human beings, synthetic oxytocin we can induce them to be more generous towards strangers, more generous towards charities. And we very recently found that when we watch and we show experimental subjects an emotionally compelling video, a video of a man whose four-year-old son has terminal brain cancer, that there\u2019s a big spike in the release of oxytocin, and people are subsequently much more generous towards a stranger. They\u2019re more generous towards charities. So somehow this molecule in our brain has allowed us to live in large groups of people where we have something in our heads that says, \u201CThis person safe, this person not. This person, I want to be around, this person I don\u2019t want to be around.\u201D So it\u2019s kind of a trust detector. And in a very real sense, it connects us to other people. It allows me to sort of emotionally mirror what other people are doing. And classically, oxytocin is associated with childbirth, reproduction in mammals. Right. I was going to say with maternal love and bonding. Right? Yeah. And in mammals care for offspring. And what we\u2019ve shown the last five years is that it makes us care about complete strangers. I should say, in these experiments, we\u2019ve run them in a laboratory. You\u2019re in a partitioned computer station, and all these interactions happen through a computer. So you\u2019re not even getting the smiles, the open expression, the happiness. So I think what this shows is that human beings are almost unique among animals in which we can\u2019t help but care about other people\u2019s welfare, and we care about what they think of us as well. And that kind of keeps us on the straight and narrow. Not all the time; we\u2019re adaptable and this system shuts down under high levels of stress. Right. And so I\u2019ve written in the Moral Markets book about the kind of environment that was created at Enron that put people under enormous amounts of stress, survival stress to keep their job. And so if you\u2019re under such enormous stress, then the system shuts down and you get to be in this \u201CI need to get through the next two hours\u201D mode as opposed to \u201CI\u2019m going to take care of people around me and this is a win-win situation.\u201D Well, and I have to say I thought that was one of the most interesting learnings. It got me wondering if the accelerating stress that\u2019s kind of been built into our everyday lives might have contributed in a very real way to some of the bad and really immoral decision making in our economy in the last few years. I tend to agree with you. Economists talk of the cleansing effect of recessions. So recessions are necessary because they kind of cull out the companies that are not providing the best customer service, that are not making a profit, that are not providing some product or service that people need. And when those businesses go out of business, then those resources are redeployed to more important uses. The machines are reused; the people get different jobs. And so this keeps the economy kind of efficient. We don\u2019t want to kind of limp along and have high levels of inefficiency just because we love the name General Motors or love the name of some company if they can\u2019t kind of keep up with the herd. So competition drives that and that\u2019s an important part of maintaining efficiency. But I think the same thing can happen in individual lives. I think as we get towards the end of every boom period, today or two years ago, the end of the 1990s and dot-com bubble, the end of the \u201980s and this kind of \u201Cme,\u201D \u201Cgreed\u201D generation, I think we do get out of whack because human beings are adaptable and we are watching what other humans are doing. We also become adaptable to this sort of yuppie, \u201Cmore stuff for me\u201D lifestyle. So I think, from a spiritual perspective, that recessions are also cleansing. So I think it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t shy away from recessions and we don\u2019t try to outlaw them. I think we should say, \u201CHey, there were excesses. This is how the excesses are corrected. And the excesses were both kind of on the macro level and even perhaps in my own life. Maybe I got a little over-excited about the extra bonuses I was getting and the bigger car. And now I want to sit down and reevaluate what\u2019s really important to me.\u201D So I think there are great analogies between the micro and the macro, and we should embrace that. Mm-hmm. Having said that, the stress issues are strong. One of the pieces of advice I like to give is: Turn off your TV. Don\u2019t listen to the pessimistic news every second of the day. Get back to \u2026 Right. Because there\u2019s another kind of stress that\u2019s created with the things that are going wrong now, right? Absolutely. So this is the time to reach out to your neighbors, as I certainly have when people around me have lost their jobs, and many others have as well. You know, do the things that are important. Do the things that are human and humane and get back to a sense of where we want to be as individuals and as a human species. Let me just ask you this, again from the perspective of your scientific research. If a stressful culture, inside our workplaces and outside it, had this power to diminish our instinct, I think what you want to say is our inclination to care morally about the consequences of our actions more, does stress also in a moment like this, in a moment where the economy is really in crisis and there are a lot of bad effects of that, does this kind of stress also make it harder for us, again, to reach out to others? I think there\u2019s two ways to answer that. The first is that appropriate levels of stress are very good for human beings. So there\u2019s sort of this misnomer that stress is bad. Too much stress is bad, but also too little stress is bad. So there\u2019s sort of this inverted U-curve, if you can see that in your head. There\u2019s sort of this sweet spot for stress that focuses your attention. So I think that when we\u2019re in that sweet spot, when we\u2019re focused, our memory\u2019s better and we\u2019re thinking clearly and we\u2019ve got to figure out what to do next, that\u2019s actually very good for human beings and actually all other animals as well. So I think this is a time when we can use that notion of appropriate stress or good stress. OK. And use that also to shed some of the inappropriate stress. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak. You state some true and obvious things that I think feel less obvious in our time, that merchants and market exchanges in essence are supposed to be, initially were, and often are about increasing the well-being of neighbors and complete strangers, that economies are driven by human beings. You know, markets are human inventions \u2014 these are your words \u2014 and market exchange is a social act. But, you know, I was also thinking about this in connection with this phenomenon we had in this economy that\u2019s now failed, this housing market. All these mortgage lenders, some of them working with very small firms, enacting transactions, which were risky at best and reckless with other people at worst. But I also wondered in that connection if what you have are these financial networks, these structures that had become \u2014 that people were so many steps removed in fact from the consequences of those actions, that that also kind of depersonalized this human dimension of the market that makes trust more possible. I agree completely with you. You know, when you took your mortgage out from your local banker who you saw every Friday when you deposited your paycheck \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 it\u2019s a much different story. And you could tell him or her, \u201CGee, I lost my job and I may not be able to make my payment this month.\u201D I think you\u2019re right: Once we so decentralize all kinds of transactions, break them into little pieces \u2014 which, by the way, is exactly what happened at Enron \u2014 you break up decisions into little pieces and you stop having this connection to the other human across the desk and it becomes just about churning, about turning over more volume. Having said that, I think this housing market bubble did identify a regulatory failure, that this, particularly in the swaps market, of this market was gigantic and only grew up in the last 10 years and was more or less unregulated. And that was a problem. So, again, the recessions are valuable, because these bubbles can\u2019t go on forever. And you say, \u201CWell, this isn\u2019t appropriate. This is not what we wanted. This is not what these instruments were designed to do, and therefore, as a society we need to choose to put some structure on this.\u201D So I think a simple example of this would be, because I live in a semi-rural area, we have a lot of farmers who sell fruit by the side of the road. So we have these stands. They\u2019re not manned, so no one\u2019s there. There\u2019s a box and there\u2019s a pack of oranges. Right. You know, the box is screwed down to this big wooden stand. So the box is not left there for you to take away; it\u2019s screwed down. And occasionally, you know, people must steal them, but for the most part, people put money in and take a bag of oranges and there\u2019s still three or four bags out there. So if you tempt people enough, you\u2019re going to encourage kind of bad behavior. So, again, as a society and as families, we always try to find that appropriate boundary between recognizing human morality and dignity and not tempting people with a vice. And so if we tempt people enough, and I think that\u2019s what happened in the mortgage market \u2026 OK. \u2026 you know, it was basically money for nothing. You know, sign people up, fake the numbers, and give people loans out. That\u2019s not appropriate. That\u2019s not the way we want to run a society, a business, and your personal finances. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak. Another scientist I\u2019ve interviewed in the past, Dr. Esther Sternberg, has broken new ground in describing how the human stress response works. She describes the economic crisis as a perfect storm for stress, and she has wisdom on how to alleviate stress and simultaneously improve our own health and that of our communities. You can listen to her and other wise voices from our Repossessing Virtue series on moral and spiritual aspects of economic crisis. That\u2019s at our Web site, speakingoffaith.org. And on the Speaking of Faith staff blog, SOF Observed, we share more detail on a trust game Paul Zak describes in his article \u201CThe Neurobiology of Trust.\u201D Read more about his research on the biological foundations of human trust and share your comments at speakingoffaith.org. After a short break, Paul Zak analyzes Bernard Madoff. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CThe Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue,\u201D part of our ongoing series \u201CRepossessing Virtue.\u201D My guest, Paul Zak, is a professor of economics at Claremont Graduate University, and he\u2019s the founding director of the Center for Neuroeconomic Studies. He has studied a powerful commonly occurring hormone, oxytocin, which some have dubbed the \u201Cmoral molecule.\u201D His laboratory experiments have found that oxytocin generates and supports caring and trustworthy behavior in most people with the right kind of encouragement. Only 2 percent of participants in his studies appear to be innately impervious to this physiological stimulus to care about the effect of their actions on others. Drawing on this research, Paul Zak has analyzed how trust works as a catalyst in successful human relationships and economic life. On the Ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff, for example, Zak has pointed out that they key to a con is not that you trust the con man, but that he shows he trusts you. And so I asked him how can people recover when such a complex dynamic is violated? So we studied this in the laboratory, and we find that when people are distrusted, when people don\u2019t reciprocate, when someone doesn\u2019t show they trust you, both men and women \u2014 but men in particular \u2014 have a strong aggressive response. They release testosterone, and they really want to punish that person. So we see this in the Bernie Madoff case where people are sending him \u2026 Or in the AIG bonus \u2026 Sure. These guys are \u2026 Yeah, that public anger. \u2026 people who don\u2019t play nice, and we like to see them punished. And that\u2019s an important part of maintaining the line between appropriate and inappropriate behavior, is that we have innate mechanisms in our brain that want us to punish people and make it fun, in fact, to punish people who don\u2019t follow the appropriate social norms. So Madoff needs to be punished. The AIG giant bonus guys really need to be punished. And that\u2019s OK. And we\u2019ve now done that as a society. Most of us don\u2019t go over and try to beat up these people, but we have a legal system that kind of does that for us. And that\u2019s an important way in laboratory experiments to sustain cooperation. So if you\u2019re having an interaction and you begin to play badly, if I have an option to punish you, I can encourage you to be cooperative. So oxytocin and the mechanisms in our brain that motivate moral behaviors are not perfectly tuned to the environment that we live in. So they are blunt instruments. They are not modifiable very rapidly. OK. We certainly learn with time. That\u2019s the good side of it. Oh, it feels good when I play nice. It feels good when someone reciprocates and they thank me for being a good citizen. But we also have this negative side, which is important for cooperation too, which is, \u201CGee, if you don\u2019t play nice, I\u2019m going to get pretty hot under the collar. I\u2019m going to let you know about it, and that\u2019s going to give you feedback on what the right boundaries are.\u201D And as a society, we do that by enacting laws and regulations. We say, \u201CThis stuff is OK, but here\u2019s the line in which if you cross that line, even if your moral intuition is not kicking in that says this is wrong, as a group we\u2019re going to tell you. We\u2019re going to say this is a line at which this is inappropriate behavior.\u201D And that helps us. Mm-hmm. And so how do you analyze the character of a person like Bernard Madoff from what you know from neuroscience and neuroeconomics? I haven\u2019t done an exhaustive study. OK. I have read up a lot, so let me put that caveat in place. Yeah. What does your kind of intuition tell you? I think he\u2019s \u2014 a couple of things we found in our laboratory studies, which may apply to him. One is we find a lot of early trauma in individuals who are kind of morally ambiguous on their actions. I haven\u2019t discovered if he\u2019s got an early trauma in his life, death of a parent, you know, bankruptcy of a business, loss of income. So we often see traumatic events in people early in life and they have a much more kind of flexible brain system. They have this more fluid sense of right and wrong than other people do, for one. And number two, I think he was also a very insecure man, liked to be the center of attention. And, boy, it\u2019s great when people are coming to you and think you\u2019re way above the rest, you\u2019re extraordinary and you\u2019re giving millions of dollars away to charities. And then he said starting in the early \u201990s, he just couldn\u2019t sustain those returns that he had so he started this kind of Ponzi scheme. So most of us would just probably take the hit and say, \u201CHey, you know, returns are down. We\u2019re going to try to adjust our strategy.\u201D Instead, he felt like he couldn\u2019t face up to that, and so it\u2019s this sense of not being able to meet the expectations that others have for you and you have for yourself, which generally lies in people who are very insecure and don\u2019t have a kind of good sense of self. So, I mean, I\u2019m assuming he would be one of that 2 percent, you think, you could imagine, in your testing who would not have this normal innate inclination \u2026 No, I don\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t? The 2 percent are \u2014 we find a very strong developmental component, and there\u2019s many studies in animals identifying how this happens. I think this is more of an acquired issue. OK. I think he was under a great deal of stress and this shut the system down. OK. The 2 percent we find, the system doesn\u2019t work from the get-go. In fact, we recently discovered that people with social anxiety disorder have this same dysfunction. They are not getting the feedback that we would get in a social setting that tells us whether our behavior is appropriate or not. So there are some clinical conditions that we\u2019re looking at now that are associated with this. So there\u2019s this sort of \u201CI\u2019m born with it\u201D 2 percent versus \u201CI\u2019m under stress and I\u2019ve kind of acquired this\u201D \u2014 the guys at Enron, Bernie Madoff. OK. You know, I want to ask you again \u2014 so trust is such an important feature in markets, in morality. Now that that is \u2014 that there\u2019s been a breach of trust, what does that do \u2014 what does that tell you about how people are going to navigate their way through this economic crisis and beyond it? There certainly is a sense of once burned, twice shy, and I think the economy will not begin to start growing until we kind of get over that. And I think the recipe to do that is to start small. You can trust your local merchant who you know, perhaps much more than some giant corporation. So it\u2019s kind of starting small and building up that trust. And we\u2019ve done studies, and other people have, on the mechanism of that and basically it\u2019s this getting comfortable with taking risk again. OK. And risk taking is really important. Risk taking is where advances, where innovations come from, but we have to be kind of willing to do it. And again, once you\u2019ve been burned and you feel like, \u201CGee, I\u2019ve seen my retirement portfolio go down by 30 percent; the last thing I\u2019m going to do is put my foot back in the water.\u201D You know, you said a moment ago that you think a moment like this is a moment to reflect and to be refreshed in a way and to ask some important \u2014 to be renewed and to ask some important moral questions \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing from many different directions. But I wonder if \u2014 I mean, you also have the cold eye of a scientist, and I wonder if your science would suggest that when the economy is moving again, let\u2019s assume that things get on to a more stable and prosperous ground again, do those kinds of questions recede or could you imagine a long-term effect of the kind of reflection that\u2019s going on now? From the way the brain is organized, I would think that we\u2019re going to have \u2014 so the brain sort of habituates to environments, and we\u2019ve habituated now to a kind of a fearful, pessimistic environment. And when we are in a euphoric setting and we\u2019re getting double-digit returns every year in the stock market or some other market, I think we also acclimate pretty quickly to that. Mm-hmm. So I think history will repeat itself. All right. I think we\u2019re not going to learn from this unless we can sit back, unless we take this opportunity to sit back and reflect and make fundamental changes. So for the people who do that, for the people who are looking at that, saying, \u201CGee, I was selling mortgages to people who had no income at all. Probably not the business I want to be in. Maybe I should use my skills for something else,\u201D and/or \u201CI don\u2019t need a bigger car than my neighbor. What I really need to do is spend more time with my family or volunteer at a charity once a week.\u201D I think those are the kind of fundamental changes that now is the time to do. And if you can set up those habits, then you will see permanent change, but I think this is the time to do it. And if you wait three years from now when the party is back on, the financial party is back on, there will be less incentive to change. OK. So pain is a great time for growth. OK. So pain is a great time for growth. OK. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CA Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue.\u201D Paul Zak is trained in economics, neuroimaging, and mathematics, and is based at Claremont Graduate University. Virtue, I think, is a word that\u2019s important to you. You\u2019ve talked about virtue as part of economic life. There\u2019s some place where you talked about Aristotle taking magnificence \u2014 that magnificence is one of the virtues that he cited in life. Talk to me a little bit about how you think about that for yourself. I think magnificence is my favorite virtue of Aristotle\u2019s. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to say, \u201CYou were magnificent today\u201D? I try to do that with the people around me. I try to recognize magnificence when it occurs and let them know how special they are. But I think this is also a time in my own life to focus on things like generosity and compassion and understanding and to use this as a bit of a teaching moment, not only for myself but certainly for my children and those around me, to think about how we can do better, how we can help more, and the value of doing that. And again, when everyone is employed, and we\u2019re not talking about people losing their houses and such and such. Right. For example, we adopted a dog recently that was going to be put down by a family who had lost their home and they had to move, and they had a number of pets. Not a healthy young dog, but an old not-so-great dog. And we sat as a family and said, \u201CWe like this dog and we don\u2019t want him to be \u2014 we don\u2019t want the family to have the pain of having to put this dog down. Let\u2019s take it in and let\u2019s try to help them and let them come and see their dog when they can.\u201D So I think, you know, all those little lessons don\u2019t always occur when you\u2019re buying the bigger house and the bigger car and you don\u2019t have to think about it. So I think we have tried, my family and I have tried to explicitly think about how we could reach out more to help others around us. You know, and I want to ask you if in addition to what is happening in the economy right now, is what you are learning about economics and morality through neuroscience and neuroeconomics, is your research challenging or supporting or possibly changing some of the assumptions about market economies that we\u2019ve held in this culture in recent years? I think we\u2019re of two minds on market economies. I think most of us have our retirement money in stocks and bonds, and so we understand that as the economy grows the stock market goes up in value and we\u2019re happy about that. On the other hand, there is this underlying sense that interacting in markets somehow degrades our dignity, is not something we should be doing. It\u2019s not our best purpose as human beings, and that thought, which is associated with Marx, for example, predates that, goes back to Aristotle and perhaps before. It\u2019s in Confucianism. So I think we are starting to take some shots from that by using this interdisciplinary approach in which we\u2019re identifying the legal aspects of an innate sense of morality. We\u2019re identifying the economic aspects. We\u2019re identifying the religious aspects. So by having this kind of conversion evidence, I think we are taking a shot on economics as bad, sort of a necessary evil. I think what we\u2019re saying is that this is a human endeavor, and humans throughout history have traded with each other, and they trade because it can make both parties better off. And to the extent that I sell you something that you need and helps you, that in fact is a moral act. Even if I\u2019m getting paid for it, it is still a moral act because I have thought about how to make you better off, how to increase your welfare, your happiness. And I think that is a different take. That\u2019s not a unique view of the economy, by the way, but it\u2019s a view that we haven\u2019t heard much about. And so I think if we think about being magnificent as customer service agents, being magnificent as managers, if we think about doing the very best in terms of teamwork to serve those around us, serve the people we work with, serve our employees, then we have a very different view of what the economic endeavor is and why it creates prosperity. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak. In addition to magnificence, Aristotle\u2019s other virtues include courage, temperance, liberality, magnanimity, pride, good temper, truthfulness, wittiness, friendliness, modesty, and righteous indignation. Do you think you live differently because of what you know through your work? What a wonderfully unfair question that is. I do. You know, I\u2019ve started to realize that I have more control over my own happiness and the happiness of those around me than I thought I did. In fact, none of us are too busy to take care of those around us, and I think in a very real sense our research shows us that we are our brothers\u2019 keepers and sisters\u2019 keepers. We can\u2019t help but be concerned for those around us. So I\u2019ll give you a quick example of that on how this system works. This doesn\u2019t happen so much anymore, but it used to be when I was younger that we\u2019d have these kids who fell down some abandoned well somewhere in Texas and it would be a big media event. And presumably, you know, millions of dollars would be spent to get this kid out of the well. And you think, \u201CWell, suppose instead of spending a million dollars to save this child, instead of doing that, let me spend a million dollars and vaccinate every child in West Virginia, Louisiana, and Mississippi against the standard childhood diseases. I probably could save a lot more lives by having an extensive vaccination program, and I\u2019ll just take that kid and I\u2019ll just cap the well and he\u2019ll stop crying after a while and we\u2019ll forget about him.\u201D Well, come on. No one can do that. We just can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re not able to do that because we\u2019re empathic creatures. Because we feel that cry. We can\u2019t ignore it. And that\u2019s the system that we\u2019re characterizing in our brains. And as long as that system\u2019s intact for the most part, I think it keeps us on this fairly virtuous path most of the time for most people. Again, if I stress you enough, I can get you off that path. And that connection is stronger and when it\u2019s one to one and in person. OK. In our experiments, people who are empathically engaged not only gave more money to a stranger in laboratory, they also gave more money to charities when given a chance. And I should say that also in these experiments, they\u2019re not the most pleasant experiments. So these individuals are getting paid, you know, we\u2019re jabbing their arm with needles and we\u2019re putting drugs into them to turn on and off parts of the brain. So they\u2019re really getting paid $40 to $50 to endure some pain and sit in the lab for a couple of hours, and yet they still voluntarily choose to give up that money to help a stranger, to help a charity once we\u2019ve engaged these brain systems regarding empathy. That\u2019s pretty amazing to me. And these are hungry college students. So you\u2019re learning about this innate moral inclination. Is there something in your research that also suggests how that can be strengthened? Are you thinking of spraying oxytocin over large urban areas? I mean \u2026 Absolutely. Put it in the water supply. So I think it\u2019s getting back to this one-on-one relationship. If I see my customer, if I see the people I work with, if I have that personal interaction from a scientific perspective, from a neuroscientific perspective, I\u2019m getting much more feedback on what I\u2019m doing, how it affects people, does it help people, is it appropriate. When I\u2019m doing all this electronically \u2014 again, \u00E0 la Enron, just to pick our favorite nasty company \u2014 then everything is easier to kind of ignore the pain you may be causing by behaving inappropriately. So I think it\u2019s that one on one. It\u2019s the going to the farmers\u2019 market. It\u2019s understanding that millions and millions of people own Wal-Mart stock, and if Wal-Mart is going to survive, they\u2019re going to try to provide the best customer service and products they can. And that\u2019s a good thing; that\u2019s something that people want. And if you want a different level of product and customer service, then you\u2019ll go to a different kind of store. So there\u2019s this fine line between economies depending on other regarding behaviors, what we might call virtuous behaviors, and competition. And the competition can sometimes drive us to behave in nonmoral ways, immoral ways. And that\u2019s, I think, where we can get out of whack. Paul Zak is professor of economics and the founding Director of the Center for Neuroeconomic Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California. He edited the book Moral Markets: The Critical Role of Values in the Economy. Paul Zak\u2019s field of neuroeconomics is young and not uncontroversial, but the importance of human emotion as a force in market economy seems more generally acknowledged in the wake of the recent economic downturn. George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, two leading economists, co-authored the book Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why it Matters for Global Capitalism. They write, \u201CJust as families sometimes cohere and at other times argue, are sometimes happy and other times depressed, are sometimes successful and at other times in disarray, so too do whole economies go through good and bad times. The social fabric changes. Our level of trust in one another varies. And our willingness to undertake effort and engage in self-sacrifice is by no means constant.\u201D Akerlof and Shiller continue, \u201CThe idea that economic crises, like the current financial and housing crisis, are mainly caused by changing thought patterns goes against standard economic thinking. But the current crisis bears witness to the role of such changes in thinking. It was caused precisely by our changing confidence, temptations, envy, resentment, and illusions \u2014 and especially by changing stories about the nature of the economy. And we know not what is yet to come.\u201D The book Animal Spirits was recommended to me by American Public Media\u2019s chief economics correspondent, Chris Farrell. After producing this program, I sat down with Chris to better understand the place neuroeconomics has in the wider world of economic theory and to ask him what it means to view economic recession as cleansing when it disrupts so many lives.
