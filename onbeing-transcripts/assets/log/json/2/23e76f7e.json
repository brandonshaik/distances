  "fullText": "Forms of religious devotion are shifting, just like every institution right now, but there\u2019s a new world of creativity towards crafting spiritual life while appreciatively exploring the depths of tradition. Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie is a fun and forceful embodiment of this evolution. Born into an eminent and ancient rabbinical lineage, as a young adult he moved away from religion towards storytelling, theater, and drag. These days, he leads a pop-up synagogue in New York City with a global profile that takes as its tagline: \u201Ceverybody-friendly, artist-driven, God-optional.\u201D This is not merely about spiritual growth and community, but about reinventing the very meaning of \u201Cwe.\u201D We are catering to generations of all ages who are seeking spiritual meaning and who are a little burnt out and tired by clich\u00E9 and by some of the religious offerings and traditional trappings. And without being too rude and too funny, the language that I\u2019ve been trying to wrestle with dances that very thin line, that very tight rope between \u2014 we\u2019re loyal to the past, and we\u2019re loyal to our audience, and we\u2019re finding the in-between. And it\u2019s how to be cheeky without being cheesy, and how to be profound, how to bring the sacred. I think we\u2019re starving for the sacred. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Amichai Lau-Lavie became a rabbi in 2016 in the conservative tradition of Judaism. He lives in New York City, where he is founding spiritual leader of Lab/Shul and the Storahtelling Project. He was born in Israel. So I ask this question of everybody, in some version, but I am really looking forward to your answer \u2014 how you would start to describe the religious background of your childhood? So my task on Fridays, growing up, in preparation for the Sabbath, was to help my mother set the table. And she would bring out the best silver and china, and I would help set it. And that means I would go around in the neighborhood and pick flowers, from either neighbors\u2019 front yards or from some general public areas. And I remember that as a task that I loved. And I would get lost, and I would make little arrangements, and I would put them in the middle of the table, and that was my thing. And this both spoke to my spiritual aesthetics, to very much being in my mother\u2019s house, and \u2014 I don\u2019t know where to put the queer, exactly, in there, but it certainly catered to that type of artistic sensibility. And people ask me today what I would do if I wouldn\u2019t be doing clergy work, and I say I would probably open a very boutique-y type of florist shop that would only function on Fridays. I love that. OK. Now was it also later, as you grew older, that you understood that you came from this 39 generations of rabbis from kind of an illustrious rabbinic dynasty? Was that history something that only made itself felt to you as you got older? On our living room wall \u2014 still is; it\u2019s a different wall, but still the living room \u2014 there was a photo of my grandfather, my father\u2019s late father, who was a rabbi and who perished in the Holocaust. And his very distinct features and looking straight into the camera was really the icon in my childhood home, both because of the martyrdom and because of the rabbinic legacy and because of the huge light that his story and tragic end cast over us. And I think I can almost place the moment when I sort of realized that this is the dynasty. And it coincided with my uncle who, when I was in my early teens, was elected as Israel\u2019s chief rabbi and whom I knew very well, and I grew up with him, and I think, at around that same time in my early teens, this notion of the legacy and its responsibility. But at some point, I realized that this is who we come from. There is a debate whether it\u2019s 37, 38, or 39 generations. But it\u2019s something in the 37-esque. And you were also that generation born of \u2014 in the aftermath of that, the 20th century\u2019s terrible convergence of Jewish history and the darkest forces of human capacity and human history. I mean your father and his younger brother were liberated from Buchenwald in 1945 \u2014 is that right \u2014 by American soldiers? Yeah. He was liberated at the age of 18 and, within a few months, went into sort of autopilot of religious observance, as a choice. And only in his late years, in his 80s, he had the ability to ask some of the faith questions, and I walked him through it and interviewed him. And he chose to remain Orthodox, to remain pious. You asked about my childhood memories of religion. And other than flowers for Sabbath and other beautiful gestures, my father would pray at home. In the mornings he would put on his tefillin, his leather phylacteries, and his prayer shawl, and he would drink a glass of tomato juice simultaneously and glimpse at the morning paper. He was a journalist. And my memory was my father having this religious ritual at home at the dining room table while multitasking with tomato juice and a newspaper that later on became CNN. And I mocked him for many years. I remember as a teen I said, like, \u201CReally? You\u2019re not praying. This is like \u2014 what is this? It\u2019s a checklist.\u201D And only later, and certainly after his death, when I inherited his prayer shawl that I now put on every morning, I realized that this was his way of sticking to discipline and committing to a path of persistence, even if the big answers and the big questions are not quite clear. Somewhere, you have spoken \u2014 and whether you had said these words or not, this is one thing that comes through in your life and your work, your calling, is this calling to serve those who are \u201Cfringe and other.\u201D And as you\u2019re speaking about the history that your family knew personally, it\u2019s clear that that flowed into this, and so did your sexual identity and the fact that \u2014 I mean this is such a striking story, that when it came time for your bar mitzvah, the Torah portion included the teaching about homosexuality as an abomination. And I wonder if, even at that time, if you were at all conscious at that time of this planting a calling in you. It\u2019s so hard to retrieve one\u2019s mindset during those angstful teen years. I have this memory of sitting at the blue desk that I had during those years between 12 and 16 and writing a short story about the scapegoat. And what happens if the Leviticus story, which is part of my bar mitzvah portion, the middle chapters of Leviticus, what if the guy whose job it is to take the scapegoat on the day of atonement and toss the scapegoat off into the wilderness \u2014 what if the guy decides not to do it, and he\u2019s just attached to the goat, and he doesn\u2019t want to send the goat off? And I think that that was my way of asking the questions that I dared not ask about the fact that by the age of 13 I knew who I was attracted to. I knew that it was an abomination, and it was a taboo that was not even to be spoken. I was in New York City at the time, in Manhattan, and so I was exposed to a great deal of opportunities \u2014 and this is early \u201980s \u2014 and writing about the scapegoat and about transgression, and what if you don\u2019t deal with the \u201Csacred trash\u201D as we are supposed to, but let it go, was my sort of crafty way of asking myself \u2014 what if? What if it\u2019s not what I grew up on? What if it\u2019s not the either/or of good, bad, kosher, treyf, abomination, sanctity? What if there\u2019s something else here? I don\u2019t recall, and I doubt I had, any role models to think about this out loud with, not until my later teens and my 20s. But I think those years planted the seeds for my \u2014 somehow, with grace and despair, I guess, ask questions that were hard enough to push me over the edge in some way and to leave, to understand that my option is either to stay within the familiar structure that I grew up with, with very clear religious and sort of societal boundaries, or dare risk the fact that there is another paradigm here, that there\u2019s another option where I\u2019m not an abomination. What I\u2019m feeling doesn\u2019t feel unholy, it doesn\u2019t feel messy, and so maybe the Torah is not right. And I remember feeling, at some point, like there was this thing \u2014 thinking, \u201COK, one day I\u2019m going to die and I\u2019m going to stand before the Throne of Glory, and there\u2019s this one option where God\u2019s going to look at me and say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you follow all the rules that all the rabbis told you? Eh. You go to hell.\u2019 Or the other option was that God\u2019s going to look at me and burst out laughing and say, \u2018Wow, why didn\u2019t you follow your heart?'\u201D And I thought that that latter option is much worse. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with performer and rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie. So it seems to me that the arts \u2014 and you are \u2014 another identity, I mean we all \u2014 what is it \u2014 we contain multitudes \u2014 you are an artist, an artistic person, that this became your way of staying with these questions. And also, I mean you just said you left, you walked out of that Judaism in which you had been raised, but it seems to me that the arts also allowed you to continue to be Jewish. You were still actually loving Judaism, even if you were doing something completely different with it and its fundaments. Yeah, I would say what initially kept me tethered in a holy way was storytelling and the understanding that while I might not sign up for the religious practice and for the faith in a God and in a legal religious system as is, I was attached and mesmerized by the body of storytelling and by the tradition of storytelling, whether it\u2019s the Talmud or the midrash, the Jewish legends, or the Kabbalistic tales. And being in a situation where I\u2019d sit around a table with a bunch of people, and we\u2019d open one of the books, and we\u2019d talk about any of the stories \u2014 Jacob wrestling or \u2014 you have it \u2014 and then the permission to use the storytelling as a pretext and as a context for our own text, for our own lives, was mesmerizing. I realized that at some point in my late teens, and that the knowledge that I\u2019m part of this relay race, of this lineage of people who for thousands of years are contemplating and interpreting the text, and that I, too, am invited and permitted to continue the interpretation on the margins that then become the text, that was what first kept me interested, in my early 20s \u2014 the notion of just opening the pages of Talmud, whether I have a beanie on my head and I\u2019m keeping the Sabbath, or not. And that eventually led into the interest in a more personalized spiritual vocabulary. When did you \u2014 how old were you when you founded Storahtelling? Storahtelling, I was about 28, 29. OK, so this kind of led to that, eventually. Yeah. Yeah. You wanted to renew the drama of the stories, it seems to me, the dynamism of the stories. I mean and even here again is where the artist of you came in. I mean there\u2019s \u2014 as you said, what if this is actually theater, and actually you\u2019re working with bestselling literature, and there\u2019s already an audience there, but it\u2019s a bad performance? And there\u2019s something very passionate \u2014 and playful, also, as serious as it is too \u2014 in the way you picked this up and wanted to transmit it to others. Absolutely. I think the playful is key, because so much of the religious narrative and situation is so heavy. And at some point I was interested in storytelling, and I thought I\u2019d be interested in theater and in drama, because I was working in a high school with kids who couldn\u2019t care less about any of this. But they did care if you got them on their feet and you started doing some drama games. So I began understanding the role of masks, both literal and figurative, and how the \u201Cas-if\u201D of story and the \u201Cimagine\u201D of storytelling and myth allows our soul and our mind to interact with possibilities that just plain facts and legal thinking, as opposed to more legendary thinking, doesn\u2019t. But here it\u2019s prime time: the Jews are in the pews, there\u2019s about 500 people here on a Saturday morning for an hour \u2014 instead of being invigorated by the storytelling, they\u2019re just being chanted to. And it\u2019s Hebrew, they don\u2019t understand it, and it\u2019s long, and it\u2019s dire. So I went researching, what is the history of this ritual, this Torah service ritual, and discover that it is indeed one of the oldest storytelling ceremonies in continuity on the planet. It is Judaism\u2019s oldest educational device of sharing the tribal story with the community once a week, and that until a thousand years ago, every time it was done it was done in split screen \u2014 you had the chanter in Hebrew and the translator in vernacular. And the translator was not just translator. He was an interpreter and a storyteller. And there are records of this tradition happening in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament in later writings. And for a bunch of reasons, this tradition died out a thousand years ago. And I thought, how fantastic to bring it back, to bring back the live translator, to bring back the emcee, to wrestle with the Biblical story in ways that will be meaningful in the 21st century and not to take it verbatim but figure out how the translation can become a theatrical, dramatized vehicle to engage people in the wrestling with the text. And how was Hadassah Gross born \u2014 who was kind of a drag character you created, Sabbath queen? Wow, you\u2019ve done your research. \u00C0 la Zsa Zsa Gabor, who just died. Yes, rest in peace. Yes. Yes, exactly. Rest in peace, Zsa Zsa. I read the obituary with extra care. Hadassah loved her. Well, I thought of you \u2014 I thought of you while I was \u2014 yeah. Well, thank you. That\u2019s a great compliment. Zsa Zsa was indeed a role model. So you know, there is this holiday once a year called Purim, which is the Jewish sort of Carnival, where the scroll of Esther is recited in synagogues and people put on masks and drink. It\u2019s very Carnival, and it has, indeed, very ancient Persian, pagan roots and sort of became Jewish-ized. I, of course, loved the Purim since I was a child. There are photos of me doing drag at the age of four. But it wasn\u2019t called drag, I\u2019m sure. It was called Purim costume. I became my cousin Rachel. Right. And then I became a Russian piano teacher \u2014 there\u2019s great photos. But yeah, you\u2019re allowed. It\u2019s the topsy-turvy. And the older I got, I was interested in what Purim has to offer us as grownups in this masking and unmasking. And also, politically, Purim is a very interesting and complicated conversation about racism and about the ethnic and the \u201Cother\u201D within us. Right. And one Purim in the late \u201990s, I was emcee of some kind of an Esther scroll event, and I had one vodka too many, and Hadassah Gross emerged out of my head like Athena, with a full \u2014 that was her name, Hadassah Gross. I knew she was Hungarian, I knew she was a widow, and she was a Kabbalah teacher. Was she a rabbi\u2019s wife, also? Yes. OK. You said you weren\u2019t going to be a rabbi, but you could be a rabbi\u2019s wife. Exactly. She was, in fact, the widow of a rabbi. And again, this is \u2014 at the time, this was just fun drag. I was in New York, I was hanging out with the Radical Faeries and other interesting queer spiritual groups where drag was sort of OK in many ways of fluidity, in between spirituality and joking and ritual and shows. And that in-between \u2014 it\u2019s not serious, it\u2019s not play, it\u2019s not drag, it\u2019s not not \u2014 lighting candles became a very sacred place. She served an important role in my own coming to terms with being out. She had an important role with my father\u2019s dealing with me coming out. How was that? Well, at some point there was an Israeli newspaper that interviewed \u2014 did a big piece on Hadassah and interviewed my father, who said \u2014 they asked him, \u201CWhat do you think about Hadassah?\u201D And he said, \u201CShe has great legs.\u201D Had you ever had a conversation with your father about this? A little bit, and it was something about the humor that allowed him to laugh with me at this phenomenon. That\u2019s lovely. So there was something very healing in what she brought. You can listen again and share this conversation with Amichai Lau-Lavie through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, exploring the reinvention of religion and the reinvention of the meaning of \u201Cwe.\u201D He is an especially creative exemplar of engaging religious tradition while also applying its forms for people now. Born of an eminent orthodox rabbinical lineage, he once moved away from Judaism towards storytelling, theater, and drag. These days, he leads something called Lab/Shul, a pop-up synagogue in New York City with a global profile that takes as its tagline: \u201Ceverybody-friendly, artist-driven, God-optional.\u201D So when you when you were ordained, The Times of Israel wrote, \u201CWith an eye on Jewish continuity, maverick spiritual leader goes mainstream.\u201D It does sound like in many of those years between your bar mitzvah and the time you were actually ordained, or decided to get on the path to becoming a rabbi, you would not have imagined that that\u2019s where you were heading, even though I also sense that you never stopped loving Judaism. I think wrestling \u2014 as you said, the story about Jacob is very apt. It\u2019s not a love/hate. It\u2019s a love and deep understanding of the deep repair and rebranding that is, in my opinion, needed. Not just rebranding in the terms of text, but in the deep tissue of what it is that thousands of years later the Jewish people carry and what gifts and treasures we still have to work through and share with the world. So I feel a deep love and a deep sense of honoring the legacy that I was born into and the richness that I\u2019m so privileged to have inherited and been taught. And what\u2019s needed in this new time, in these new days and this new paradigm where Judaism, I believe, must evolve, is evolving to retain its particularity while being radically universal. So when you use language like \u201Crebranding,\u201D I think it could be heard as kind of cynical or dumbing things down, turning to consumerist impulses. And I don\u2019t think you \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t actually sound that way when it comes out of your mouth, but I think a cynic would hear it that way. To me, it kind of points back at the artist in you. I mean you\u2019d said at some point that you once went around saying that artists are the new rabbis, and then you transitioned to \u201Crabbis are the new artists.\u201D And so if I look at the \u2014 well, maybe let\u2019s call it the tagline of Lab/Shul \u2014 would you call Lab/Shul, would you call it a congregation, a synagogue? Yes. No, it\u2019s a congregation. It\u2019s your congregation, and you are the spiritual leader, the founding spiritual leader. So it\u2019s \u201Ceverybody-friendly, artist-driven, God-optional, all ages.\u201D And just tell me a little bit about why those four phrases? And missing is \u201Cpop-up,\u201D by the way, which is not there. What\u2019s missing? What is? \u201CPop-up.\u201D Pop-up. Pop-up. So we\u2019re transient, physical-wise. And the taglines really look at what does it mean for us to reimagine what is the role and the purpose of, certainly, religion and the Jewish story in the 21st century. So \u201Ceverybody-friendly\u201D means that we\u2019re really not checking who you are based on descent or consent or blood or belief. You\u2019re here as a seeker \u2014 welcome. Jew, Jew-ish, other, blended families, people from all paths \u2014 welcome. \u201CGod-optional\u201D is a tricky term that I came up with because for so many people, the word \u201CGod\u201D is so off-putting, and the notion of prayer or a transcendental being, deity, that we grew up with in the Hebrew schools and in the synagogues of our youth, is not really speaking to who we are. So God-optional is our way of saying agnostic-friendly, atheist-friendly. It\u2019s a metaphor. If you truly connect to prayer: yay. If not, it\u2019s a meditation. We translate all of our liturgy in ways that are gender neutral, hierarchy-less, and God-optional. And that\u2019s rather radical and speaks very, very powerfully to people of a lot of different backgrounds who are just invited into the contemplative, into the spiritual presence, understanding that our liturgy is, indeed, poetry, and it\u2019s metaphor, and it\u2019s inviting us to be present. And artists are involved with every single step of how we build ritual and how we do everything, how we structure our communal life. So \u201Cartist-driven\u201D is very important. \u201CPop-up\u201D is primarily because we\u2019re in New York City, and real estate is insane, and we cannot afford a building. But that\u2019s also a philosophy. We go from wineries to museums to galleries, in Brooklyn or Harlem or downtown, and we use the internet a lot. So it\u2019s sort of an intimate, cozy place to try things out. So there\u2019s so many things we could talk about, and I have so many notes about High Holidays Boot Camp and the meaning of repentance and \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll get to some of that. I think it would be good to dwell with this moment we inhabit. We\u2019re speaking as the political reality around the world is in a very unsettled state. And lots of surprises, lots of \u2014 well, I think unsettled is the way a lot of people feel all around, on every side. So maybe kind of focus on how I kind of draw you out on theology and faith and community in the context of now. I do have to say, and I haven\u2019t seen you quoting Heschel anywhere, although probably you have \u2014 I keep thinking of this line of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who was also at Jewish Theological Seminary, where you went and were ordained in the conservative tradition, this line of Heschel: \u201CIn a free society, some are guilty, while all are responsible.\u201D You wrote this beautiful reflection on words, moving into the High Holy Days. Is that recent? What was the\u2026 On words \u2014 \u201COur private and public words matter a lot in this world of so many words.\u201D Was that not you? It sounds familiar. It\u2019s either very recent, something I wrote last week, or it is part of the\u2026 I think it\u2019s very recent. Yeah, so it must be something, I think, I wrote last week as I was \u2014 it was the second anniversary of my father\u2019s death, and I was at the cemetery, and my uncle and brother and family insisted on chanting many, many, many Psalms. And I was thinking, \u201CWow. We\u2019re chanting all the Psalms so that we don\u2019t talk,\u201D and went, \u201CWhat are the words we need, or what are the words we don\u2019t need, and what are the rituals that are healthy and vibrant, and which ones need a bit of help? And where are we at this moment, that what we need are healthy words and healing words and space for words, and not just recycling the old words?\u201D There\u2019s a transition. But I think both, right? Aren\u2019t you saying, I mean \u2014 both\u2026 No, it\u2019s absolutely both. I mean you wrote that \u201CWe chant the ancient words as did our ancestors before us, fragile, human, hopeful, honest in our return to this place, this time, this word, on our journey.\u201D Yeah, I think the words are the black box that contains so many of the ancestral aspirations and truths \u2014 and also baggage that needs to be checked. There is an evolution. Not everything that we\u2019ve inherited is worthy of being passed on, like trauma and like memories and like values that have evolved. Part of the reason why I\u2019m not an Orthodox Jew but a flexidox or polydox and otherwise-Jew, and not just \u201CJew,\u201D is that I do believe in evolution, not just of our species and the world, but of concepts. And if the Bible and the Jewish values that have sustained my people for thousands of years believe that women were subservient and that sexuality was of a specific type and that types of worship included slaughtering animals, we\u2019ve evolved. That\u2019s not where we are. So we need to read some of those sacred words as metaphor, as bygone models, as invitations for creativity, and for sort of the second meaning and the second na\u00EFvet\u00E9 here that still retrieves this text as useful and these narratives as holy, not as literal. I think that is, of course, the conversation between so many of us of different religions who are struggling with our brothers and sisters who choose to read things literally and speak for a Biblical truth that is unalterable, where we \u2014 some of us think that there is room here for creativity, for sacred metaphor and change. And we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re not there yet for those days of dignity and equality and radical justice that Heschel and Dr. King and so many of our leaders, then and now, are hoping for. And here we are \u2014 oh, my God \u2014 again? Right. And we weren\u2019t \u2014 I mean you and I could talk about an hour, for an hour, but I mean we weren\u2019t there before, either, and weren\u2019t quite as conscious as we should have been about how many people were left out and how many things had been happening that flew in the face of these values. There\u2019s a real, kind of natural, human pattern at work right now, which is, change does happen at different paces for different people, and there\u2019s kind of a classic reaction. But it\u2019s a reaction to change that is underway. So in that sense, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be so surprised, because the magnitude of the changes \u2014 of mentality, of behavior, of values, of imagination \u2014 they\u2019re vast, and they\u2019re happening on so many different levels right now. I want to share with you the story that really came to me right after the elections, and I\u2019ve used it a lot since. It\u2019s this Talmudic parable about a ship that is sailing, and there are many cabins. And one of the people in the cabins on the lower floor decides to dig a hole in the floor of his cabin, and does so, and sure enough, the ship begins to sink. And the other passengers suddenly discover what\u2019s going on and see this guy with a hole in the floor. And they say, \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D And he says, \u201CWell, it\u2019s my cabin. I paid for it.\u201D And down goes the ship. Right. And it\u2019s a story in the Talmud that talks about human responsibility in the Jewish sense \u2014 that we\u2019re all in the same ship together. But I\u2019ve been wrestling with it and talking about it from the day after \u2014 from November 9, talking about what does it mean for us to be that person? And where have we been only focusing on my cabin and me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me, and where are we not part of a \u201Cwe\u201D? And how is that true of every single one of us, and how that is true in some ways of America, and how the narcissistic, me-focused, insight-driven, my own needs and aspirations in this age have taken so hold of us that the sense of public and communal and responsible-for-other, including the limping and the weak at the edges of our camp, in some way has not been looked at as religious traditions have taught us to and as the Bible again and again reminds us: \u201CRemember the Other. Remember the Other. You were the Other.\u201D And then the question is, what is the \u201Cwe,\u201D because the boundaries of what is \u201Cwe \u201Care shifting. Yeah, what is the \u201Cwe,\u201D and how do we \u2014 how do we weave that together, right? Right. It\u2019s so easy to descend into animosity and either/or. And I\u2019m in the middle of an email volley with someone in my vast family who is a lovely, lovely, lovely gentleman, who sent an email around to the family saying that he voted for Trump. And I couldn\u2019t understand the level of rage that came out of me in wanting to communicate with him. And I thankfully have the ways of containing and curbing my enthusiasm and waiting 24 hours before I send some emails, and so I waited to send him a very short note that said, \u201CI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re honoring our past ancestors together. It seems like we can\u2019t quite agree on the present and the future.\u201D And I\u2019m trying to think, how do we use love? How do we go face-to-face in difficult conversations with those who see the world so differently than some of us and whose values are coming from the good place of \u201Cme\u201D and \u201Cpreservation,\u201D and even have a \u201Cwe\u201D in mind, but it\u2019s not as expansive and radical as the we that I\u2019m thinking of and some of us are? How do we use love? I\u2019m sure that that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s keeping you up at night. I know it\u2019s keeping me up at night. Yeah, and it is something we \u2014 we have to walk this, right, because there aren\u2019t answers to that question you\u2019re posing. I mean I was thinking, also, at the very beginning when you talked about a new sense of God being born after the Holocaust, that the kindness \u2014 kindness \u2014 I mean I think love is also \u2014 it sounds so grand, and it sounds like it\u2019s something you have to feel. And this love we have to practice now and learn to practice is so much more practical than that. It\u2019s daily. It\u2019s daily practice. It\u2019s ironic to me now \u2014 I\u2019m in my late 40s, and I\u2019m a father, and I\u2019m a rabbi, and I\u2019m looking at my life and how it\u2019s evolving and who knows what else. And I sit every morning for a few moments, wrapped up in my father\u2019s prayer shawl. I meditate and write in my journal. I rarely use any of the liturgical texts. And what it\u2019s about is discipline. It\u2019s just daily discipline. It\u2019s a workout. And it\u2019s the workout for gratitude. And it\u2019s a workout for what Heschel called radical amazement and wonder. And it\u2019s just an exercise in meditation in silence. Sit for a few moments and cultivate love. And I\u2019m so amazed that at this point, this tool that I inherited that\u2019s in my toolbox is right there. And I don\u2019t drink tomato juice, and I don\u2019t read the paper, but I kind of do what my father did. I carve this little space each day for being in the \u201Cme\u201D so I can be there more for the \u201Cwe,\u201D and I am now really conscious of how, at core, it is an exercise in love so that I can be there, more agile and helpful when more contentious moments happen the moment I turn on my phone or open my front door. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with performer and rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie. I was looking at the Lab/Shul website, and it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s really fun. And I think it follows on \u2014 it\u2019s kind of an expression of the playful and serious forms that way of moving forward can take. Like there\u2019s one post that\u2019s advice from Kermit. And I don\u2019t know if you write these, or who writes these. \u201CLast night, 15 Lab/Shul co-creators answered their first ever community call to action to share their energy, excitement, and exasperation in this moment when our political future feels uncertain. The resounding answer: connect. Or our sage Kermit the Frog says, \u2018Someday we\u2019ll find it / The rainbow connection / The lovers, the dreamers, and me.\u2019\u201D And I\u2019ve been humming that song ever since, because I still remember learning that when my kids were small, and it\u2019s such a beautiful song. Well, I\u2019m so happy to say that this is one of the few posts that I did not write. OK. But I believe Rabbi Kerry, who\u2019s part of our team now did, together with some of our team members. And my joy is that the language that I\u2019ve tried to convey is this very delicate combination of reverence and irreverence. And it\u2019s because we are catering to generations of all ages who are seeking spiritual meaning and who are a little burnt out and tired by clich\u00E9 and by some of the religious offerings and traditional trappings. And without being too rude and too funny, the language that I\u2019ve been trying to wrestle with is one that dances that very thin line, that very tight rope between \u2014 we\u2019re loyal to the past, and we\u2019re loyal to our audience, and we\u2019re finding the in-between. And it\u2019s how to be cheeky without being cheesy\u2026 Right. That\u2019s good. And how to be profound, how to bring the sacred in many ways. Right. Right. : I think we\u2019re starving for the sacred in so many ways. In the Jewish world, there\u2019s this renaissance of various attempts to both bring social justice and human dignity and spirituality and practice and wisdom to the forefront. And it does take rebranding. And it takes reimagining what we have to offer and how we get to mix and match with other traditions. And that is a historical precedent that I think we are now waking up to understand how radical it is that you and I are having this conversation and that Muslim leaders and Buddhist leaders and Zen leaders and Shinto leaders and indigenous \u2014 we\u2019re all mixing and matching our tools. And the trick is, how do we keep and retain our indigenous wisdom while having these labs and these conversations where we get to play and share and expand the we. But I don\u2019t actually think that that \u2014 like, that looks like it would be the challenge, on the surface, but I don\u2019t think it often is, because in really profound \u2014 the kind of paradox of authentic, profound, interreligious connection \u2014 or, I think, connection across meaningful boundaries \u2014 you don\u2019t give up the ground you stand on, right? The world becomes larger because you have seen this other, and you may have an appreciation for them or a curiosity about what they bring into the world, but it\u2019s also, the ground beneath your feet is somehow richer and more interesting. That\u2019s so often the way it goes. If you are \u2014 if one is aware of the ground beneath one\u2019s feet. I think one of the \u2014 where this post-ethnic opportunity and this interreligious dialogue becomes challenging is that for so many people of different faiths, the last century has not provided deep education and literacy of what it is that\u2019s so sacred and meaningful about our ground. Yeah, and to me \u2014 again, on the Lab/Shul website there is a write-up about something that I heard about after the election, these meetings with Muslim and Jewish women. Did you write this one? \u201COn Sunday, I sat, cried, and sang with 500 Muslim and Jewish women at the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom gathering.\u201D No, that\u2019s Rabbi Kerry again. It\u2019s a beautiful \u2014 and might sound really counterintuitive that this is also a product of the post-9/11 world. And it\u2019s very much in contrast to the renewed language of \u201Cthe other\u201D that\u2019s out there in culture, and again, interestingly, in some ways a response to it. The Friday after the elections, along with a few other people I ended up in the mosque on Friday afternoon, as they were at prayers. We stood outside with signs that said \u201CTogether against hate.\u201D And I was standing there with my skullcap on my head, and I was invited into the mosque to say a few words. And I was like, here I am inside a mosque, kneeling, praying, meditating with people \u2014 this would not have happened. So what is the opportunity here to discover common ground, not in anti-, but in for and in favor of enlarging our sense of human responsibility? And the mystical, or the ethical Jewish notion of \u201Cwe are each created in the divine image\u201D is the candle that is lit on my altar, and in many ways, I believe, it is lit on many, many, many altars, but in some cases, the light just doesn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t cast wide enough. And one of the challenges, I will certainly say as a Jew right now, is for us to understand, in the 21st century, what is a Jew? Who is in, who\u2019s out, how are we expanding and redefining the boundaries? And again it goes back to the question of who is \u201Cwe,\u201D because it\u2019s changing, and for some people it\u2019s too fast and too radical and too scary, and for others it\u2019s too nebulous. And for others, it\u2019s too slow, right? Right. And there\u2019s so much wisdom in slow. In 2006, the conservative movement, after almost a decade of deliberations and more, even, decided to allow LGBT students to be admitted to the rabbinical seminary. And here we are, 100 years since women were able to vote in this country, and a century is and is not a long time. And I come from a long, long tradition of thousands of years of people trying to make sense of the world. Some of the changes are going to happen in my lifetime. Others, I now know, might not. But the question is, what seeds do we keep on planting, and what low-hanging fruit can we keep on plucking? And now, I would say, more than ever, as you said, we\u2019re in such a moment of uncertainty. It feels like the call to invest in the local, communal, is essential \u2014 people need each other face-to-face, hand-to-hand \u2014 while at the same time not losing sight of the bigger \u201Cwe,\u201D the global \u201Cwe.\u201D Right, and figuring out how to do that, how to invest in both of those ways of being in the world. And we need each other to figure it out, because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a lot to ask, right? It\u2019s a lot to ask, with this history we have as a species and what feels instinctive to us, even when it flies in the face of what we deeply want. And in fact, you know that our DNA is able to handle 150 names or so, and that we do have this sort of tribal sense of the local and intimate and the immediate, and yet we\u2019ve got thousands of Facebook friends, and we are simultaneously called to have true empathy and compassion to what happened yesterday in Berlin and in Ankara and in Aleppo and in Brooklyn and in Jerusalem. And it\u2019s all in my feed, and it\u2019s all people I know, and my little homo sapiens brain and heart isn\u2019t built to handle this level of traffic. Yeah, that\u2019s right. So I either shut down, and I only focus on my peeps, or I find some way to navigate and to negotiate what is fidelity and what is responsibility and how do I have the circles of intimacy and containers of we that sustain me and I can be helpful with. And how, in other ways, can I be an agent of growth in a larger scale, in this global economy we\u2019re invited to be part of. So I feel that it\u2019s about showing and not telling. And I am co-creating a Jewish and a Jew-ish and a spiritual conversation that I consider to be triage, at this point. This is first aid for spiritual seekers who are very, very thirsty. And it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. My mother came for my ordination back in May, and we went back and forth for weeks, whether she will be with us for the Sabbath morning practice. My mother is observant and religious, and she prays in a synagogue where women and men sit separately, and there\u2019s no music and there\u2019s no electricity, and certainly no priests and vicars on the stage. And I said, \u201CWell, it\u2019s going to be that kind of Shabbat. There\u2019s going to be a lot of music. There\u2019s going to be a lot of faith leaders. There\u2019s going to be all of us sitting together \u2014 and I\u2019d love you to be there.\u201D And she came, to her great credit, and said to me later, \u201CI was very moved. This is absolutely not my cup of tea. I will not be back. But I love what you did. I\u2019m looking around at these hundreds of people who are in tears, who are dancing, who are praying, who are delighted to be part of this tradition, otherwise they would not have had a place to tap into the sacred.\u201D So my mom is not my audience. I\u2019ve done enough therapy to deal with that. Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie is founding spiritual leader of Lab/Shul in New York City and the founding director of Storahtelling."
