  "fullText": "\u201CBelonging creates and undoes us both.\u201D This is the wisdom of P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama, an extraordinary healer in our world of fracture. He leads the Corrymeela community of Northern Ireland, a place that has offered literal refuge and seeds of new life in and since the violent fracture that defined that country until the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. But P\u00E1draig and Corrymeela extend a quiet, generative force far beyond their northern coast. They\u2019ve learned what they know the hard way, yet they carry it with an infectious, calming joy. \u201COver cups of tea, and over the experience of bringing people together,\u201D as Padraig describes it, it does become possible \u201Cto talk with each other and be in the same room with the people we talk about.\u201D Agreement has rarely been the mandate for people who love each other. Maybe on some things, but actually, when you look at some people who are lovers and friends, you go actually they might disagree really deeply on things, but they\u2019re somehow \u2014 I like the phrase \u201Cthe argument of being alive.\u201D Or in Irish, when you talk about trust, there\u2019s a beautiful phrase from West Kerry where you say, \u201CMo sheasamh ort l\u00E1 na choise tinne,\u201D \u201CYou are the place where I stand on the day when my feet are sore.\u201D And that is soft and kind language, but it is so robust. That is what we can have with each other. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. In addition to his work in conflict resolution, P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama is a theologian and poet, and the author of an incandescent memoir, In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World. He grew up near Cork in the south, the Republic of Ireland. Some of us from the On Being team traveled to Corrymeela\u2019s main campus in the far north village of Ballycastle for this interview. At any given time, there are are hundreds of young people from around the world spending weeks or months here as volunteers. Full disclosure, I\u2019ve been in a conversation with P\u00E1draig for many years, after he reached out to tell us that he and others were using On Being in Northern Ireland. But in the intervening time, we\u2019ve learned far more from him than he has from us. Yeah, so we\u2019re so happy to be here at Corrymeela, all of us from On Being, and had such a beautiful couple of days in Belfast that have really \u2014 really, the reason we came is to interview you. So here we are. So, how would you begin to reflect on the religious or spiritual background of your life? I was thinking about this yesterday because I had a little inkling that you would be asking the question. Yeah. I mean, a very Irish Catholic background growing up in Cork. And Catholicism was part of everything, prayers you said at night. We said the rosary in Irish at night as a family and in school preparation for the sacraments, all of those things that were just taken for granted. When I was 11, there was a boy in the class who suddenly wasn\u2019t there anymore. And somebody said, \u201CI heard a rumor that he went to the Protestant school.\u201D And we were shocked these \u2014 I mean, we weren\u2019t angels. But we were suddenly like, \u201CThere has been one among us.\u201D Not telling us \u2014 and so there was just this sense that it was part of who you were in that sense. What it meant to be Catholic, what it meant to be Irish, all of those things were all ingrained together. I think, for me, a spiritual background for me is also language. I grew up with Irish and English. And knowing two languages and knowing, I suppose, the language that came from the earth of this Ireland has been very important for me also. And that, to my mind, over years, has grown in its significance in terms of understanding that that isn\u2019t merely having another language, but actually, it goes deep into the bones. It goes deep into the essence of what I have found to be important. There\u2019s a lot of lovely and popular spiritual writing about the notion of \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Cbe here now.\u201D And I mean, the subtitle of your book, In The Shelter, is Finding a Home in the World. You mention your favorite poem by David Wagoner called \u201CLost.\u201D And there are these two lines: \u201CWherever you are is called Here, / And you must treat it as a powerful stranger.\u201D And it seems to me that from a young age, you had a sense that there are many worlds within the world. But then you talk about moving to Belfast in 2003, which \u2014 and you had lived in many countries, right? You\u2019d lived \u2014 where had you lived at that point? Australia, Switzerland \u2014 I\u2019d done some work in Uganda, and the Philippines, and Lithuania as well. Yeah, and you come back here. It\u2019s not exactly where you grew up in Ireland. No. But one might think \u2014 especially, I think, one on the outside might think you had come home, and this would be a familiar \u201Chere\u201D where \u2014 which you would not have to treat as a powerful stranger. But it almost seems like it was your lesson\u2026 Oh, totally. And the complication for me was moving home to Ireland after those years away and suddenly being back in Ireland, being north of the border, and realizing that some places that I went, people would say, \u201COh, you\u2019re from Cork. We beat you in the hurling last weekend. You\u2019re just a local, just 250 miles down the road. But you know, you\u2019re just local.\u201D And other people would say, \u201COh, you\u2019re from Ireland. What\u2019s it like for you living in our country?\u201D And you\u2019re kind of going, \u201CI think I\u2019m in my own country. I can read the etymology of the land, of the place names. I feel at home here.\u201D And so suddenly this question of, \u201CWhat is home?\u201D was really complicated. And here \u2014 you hear that way when people are speaking here, because Northern Ireland or the North of Ireland, though basically \u2014 they can be loaded terms. Sometimes you hear people saying, \u201COh today\u2019s a great day in this part of Ireland.\u201D And other people say, \u201CToday is a great day in this part of the United Kingdom.\u201D So \u201Chere\u201D is actually a complicated compromise. Also to be able to say, \u201CWhat is happening right here, right now?\u201D Even if it\u2019s not what you\u2019d choose. And I think that is one of the things that, for me, spirituality as well as conflict resolution is about. There\u2019s \u2014 so much of things are saying, \u201CI wish things were different.\u201D \u201CI wish I were somewhere else.\u201D \u201CI wish this were not happening.\u201D And what David Wagoner says is, \u201CThe place where you are is called Here, / And you must treat it as a powerful stranger.\u201D And powerful strangers might be benevolent, but only might. Powerful strangers can also be unsettling and troubling. And powerful strangers can have their own hostilities, and have their own way within which they cause you to question who you are and where you\u2019re from. And that is a way within which, for me, the notion of saying hello to \u201Chere\u201D requires a fairly robust capacity to tell the truth about what is really going on. And that can be very difficult. I want to draw this out a little bit just because I know people will be listening from the United States. And this place, you talk about discovering all the many subtle and not so subtle ways people have to signal which \u201Chere\u201D they are from and not from. Totally. And that is where language is limited. Because language needs courtesy to guide it, and an inclusion and a generosity that goes beyond precision and becomes something much more akin to sacrament, something much more akin to how is it you can be attentive to the implications of language for those in the room who may have suffered. It\u2019s the dark side of the power of language. Totally. Oh my god. It\u2019s \u2014 right? How a single word, a name\u2026 Oh, completely. \u2026can wound and exclude. You and I were talking last night, and I can\u2019t remember the details, but about how \u2014 I think also around this subject of the Troubles. But it\u2019s equally true in my country right now, a single word, there are so many charged words and phrases that if someone introduces into the room, it\u2019s going to set off this cascade of reactions, and part of that reaction is \u201CI know exactly what you\u2019re about.\u201D I think we infuse words with a sense of who we are. And so therefore, you\u2019re not just saying a word; you\u2019re communicating something that feels like your soul. And it might even be your soul. So the choice of a particular word is really, really important. And there is what is in the text, and whether that\u2019s a sacred text or the text of somebody\u2019s life. And then there is the lenses through which you read and interpret that. And those lenses I find to be extraordinarily practical. There is the way within which there\u2019s a generosity of listening. And when somebody says something to try to figure out, \u201CDid I hear them correctly?\u201D Because sometimes I\u2019ve heard what I want to hear, and I might be completely wrong. And that can be healing. One time, somebody came up to me after I\u2019d spoken and said, \u201CThat thing you said really helped me.\u201D I went, \u201CWhat thing?\u201D because I was curious. And they quoted something \u2014 I hadn\u2019t said it at all. I was delighted to take credit for it. But I also\u2026 And you don\u2019t correct them because they heard something in what you said that was their translation. They probably heard themselves. Right. And I was just lucky enough to happen to be in the way, wittering on about something, Irish language or something. And they happened to hear what it was that their life has been leading them to need to say. And I think \u2014 so sometimes, it can be extraordinarily healing. It can be very harmful when it is that we have not listened well and go, \u201CWell, when that person said that\u201D \u2014 and they might not have even have said that \u2014 \u201Cthey meant that.\u201D So there are at least two violations of language happening there. And language has the capacity to communicate who we are, and so therefore, the interpersonal space and the encounter becomes really weakened. There\u2019s this language now in the States of \u201Ctrigger\u201D language, which really, even the image itself is violent. Yeah, it is. And I mean, I find myself in situations where sometimes I will say \u2014 just to let anybody know \u2014 Cathal was my friend who took his own life. I really appreciate it if somebody\u2019d said something about suicide in advance of the conversation in the few years after that. I thought it would be just a few months, but it was a few years, really. When I just thought I won\u2019t be able to cope with the ocean of everything that will happen here, partly because I was living so far away, and I couldn\u2019t come to any even reconciling relationship with grief because I was living on the other side of the planet. And so I can really respect, and I\u2019ve been the benefit of times when people have said that. But the complication is that life comes with no trigger warning. Things happen out of the blue. Something happens, and suddenly, with no preparation, you find yourself in the middle of something that you didn\u2019t wish to happen. And I think that\u2019s why, for me, \u201Chere\u201D is really important because that\u2019s the space for \u2014 when you are in a situation for which nothing has prepared you, to have the language of \u201Chere,\u201D it is not gentle. It\u2019s not even consoling. It just might be part of the truth. And that can be healing, to simply tell part of the truth. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in Northern Ireland with theologian, poet, and social healer P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama. One thing you say out of all this experience you\u2019ve had of being with people in charged situations having difficult conversations \u2014 and this is an important truth, and it\u2019s really hard to take in \u2014 that \u201Cmost people do what seems reasonable to them at the time most of the time.\u201D I mean, just that, that the people who may be so offending us and may seem frightening to us are actually doing what seems reasonable to them. And it\u2019s not always safe to decide to be curious about that, but I think there\u2019s a big place where it is safe; it\u2019s just going to be really uncomfortable. Totally. And I recognize that sometimes people will need to extend their generosity to me, saying, \u201CHe thinks he\u2019s doing what\u2019s reasonable to him at the time.\u201D Right. It works in both directions. It works in all those directions. And so it\u2019s really an important thing to do. I think, probably, most of us learned most of our lessons for our wider public life from the private life. And I suppose, for years and years, I worked in a really rich, faithful, loving, Christian community environment, where nobody had a clue that I was gay. And so, when people don\u2019t know or think that there is nobody around to hear the kind of things that they\u2019re saying, people say some pretty harsh things. But they loved me. I knew that. And I loved them also. And I suppose one of the things that being closeted for many years helped, actually \u2014 not that this is good advice, but it is wisdom, retrospectively \u2014 it helped me to understand some of the dynamics that were happening underneath the kind of public things people said in order to then think, when it comes to having conversations about anything that divides us, that understanding itself is a really wise thing. Understanding doesn\u2019t mean agreeing. But I think sometimes when you ask a question in charged situations to try to understand a narrative that you might find intolerable, people think, well, you\u2019re being complicit in that by giving that. And I think in situations like here, where people have had so many experiences of terrible difficulty, to understand might actually help us to heal. It doesn\u2019t make it right. It doesn\u2019t make it that you agree. Right. It doesn\u2019t mean agreeing. It doesn\u2019t mean condoning. But when you said our words, they hold so much from us. They hold our hopes and fears. Do you remember years ago, I interviewed Richard Mouw, the Christian theologian who\u2026 What were you speaking \u2014 I always forget the names, but I always remember the conversation. We were speaking about gay marriage back when\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes. \u2026back when that was a distant remote possibility. Maybe eight, nine years ago, which is amazing. It\u2019s very recent, really\u2026 And so, he was somebody whose theology, whose reading of the Bible leads him to believe that this is not something that the church should sanctify, and yet, who understands that the measure of Christian fidelity is about much more than a position you take on an issue, and has tried to walk that, live in that tension. But he \u2014 one of the things he said, and you\u2019ve kind of put a theoretical framework around that, is we have to stop engaging on this in terms of \u2014 by calling each other names. And we have to start \u2014 we have to figure out if we can inquire and get curious and connect on a human level about, \u201CWhat are the hopes and fears we are bringing to this?\u201D Totally. But that\u2019s a question we hardly know how to ask once we\u2019ve turned something into an issue. Yeah. And it becomes a very, very difficult question to curate in the public space. Oh, yeah. Because suddenly, to ask it is to be complicit. And so maybe that\u2019s why there are a need for really robust private conversations about public matters. But there does need to be the stage then where we can go, \u201CWhat can this mean for the wider civilization?\u201D How is it that we can say \u2014 because ultimately that becomes a way of embedding fear. And I would like that public conversation can be a way within which we can talk about things with less fear. The Good Friday Agreement from 1998 \u2014 and limited as all those treaties are \u2014 has been something that ushered in something quite extraordinary. And one of the things that you hear people speaking about regularly is to say that in perpetuity, the Good Friday Agreement\u2026 And this was what brought peace\u2026 Peace agreement. At the end. Yes. Peace. Yes. To bring 30 years of conflict and murder and separation to some kind of robust framework for moving forward into a better peace and a better living together. And the Good Friday Agreement guarantees that people born here can have access to passports \u2014 British, Irish, either or both. And that that piece of language is a really important piece of language, and it introduces softness and more than just an either/or option into something that could have been tense. And I\u2019ve heard people who find themselves to go, \u201CThat is challenging, but it is also a guarantee.\u201D And I think that\u2019s a really important thing to recognize. And often, our public discourse, whatever the issue that\u2019s dividing us, it needs a wise framing. It needs careful questioning. And it needs a way within which we can speak about these things, recognizing that words have impact. And often, if people use unwise words, they return to their intention. \u201CWell, I didn\u2019t mean that. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201D Without paying attention to impact. Right. Somewhere you said, \u201CThe awful truth is that our mixed intentions sometimes have the unmixed impact of terror.\u201D Totally. And we hear that at Corrymeela all the time. People who would say, \u201CI heard something on the radio where immigrants or Protestants, or Muslims, or whoever, British people, Irish people\u201D \u2014 whatever that gathering narrative is, where somebody says something about that, and actually it causes fear. It causes people maybe to close their doors, to feel a little bit more worried. And when you begin to feel that, you begin to look for it. And the awful thing is you might find it then, even if it isn\u2019t there. And that can cause a real limitation in a life. And that fails us. And that really does fail us. So the question is, how is it that language, simple language \u2014 I don\u2019t mean complicated language that you need a dictionary to plow your way through \u2014 I mean plain, good, wise language \u2014 that can be the thing that might help us. Do you want to read any \u2014 a poem that \u2014 along those lines? Something come to mind? Yeah. There\u2019s one \u2014 so one of the complications of here is, do you call it Northern Ireland or the North of Ireland? And in a bid to irritate everybody, I wrote a poem called \u201CThe Northern of Ireland.\u201D \u201CIt is both a dignity and / a difficulty / to live between these / names, / perceiving politics / in the syntax of / the state. / And at the end of the day, / the reality is / that whether we / change / or whether we stay / the same / these questions will / remain. / Who are we / to be / with one / another? / and / How are we / to be / with one / another? / and / What to do / with all those memories / of all of those funerals? / and / What about those present / whose past was blasted / far beyond their / future? / I wake. / You wake. / She wakes. / He wakes. / They wake. / We Wake / and take / this troubled beauty forward.\u201D There\u2019s another one that happened \u2014 if you don\u2019t mind. Yeah, sure. This is just a short one. The poem is called \u201CPedagogy of Conflict.\u201D \u201CWhen I was a child, / I learnt to count to five: / one, two, three, four, five. / But these days, I\u2019ve been counting lives, so I count / one life / one life / one life / one life / Because each time is the first time that that life has been taken. / Legitimate Target / has sixteen letters / and one / long / abominable / space / between / two / dehumanising / words.\u201D You can listen again and share this conversation with P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in Northern Ireland with P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama. He\u2019s the author of a beautiful book, In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World. He\u2019s also a poet, a theologian, and the leader of a community that helped bring peace to Northern Ireland after generations of violent social fracture. Corrymeela, as it\u2019s called, remains a beacon and refuge for people around the world. I interviewed P\u00E1draig at a gathering of community members in the Croi at Corrymeela, the Irish word for \u201Cheart.\u201D It is a sacred place of prayer, discussion, and rest, built in the shape of a heart as a listening chamber. I want to keep going on this work, of this wisdom you have, and actually, this wisdom this place has, about understanding who we are to each other and how we are to each other. Because as I\u2019ve said a couple of times, in these days that we\u2019ve been in Northern Ireland, it\u2019s very striking to me that we\u2019re in a place that has, in living memory, moved away from sectarianism. While at this particular moment in history, in these early years of the 21st century, many places, including my country, feel like they are gravitating towards sectarianism. But I want to talk about the fact that you\u2019re gay and\u2026 Really? Yes. And how \u2014 here\u2019s the thing, P\u00E1draig, that really strikes me. Reading you and reading about the work you\u2019ve done around this, and also just how you\u2019ve inhabited this part of your identity in the work you do, whether it\u2019s the focus or not \u2014 and I think it rarely is the focus \u2014 you are in an interesting position because this is culturally a time when there have been these huge, transformative, revolutionary shifts. I mean, Ireland voting to\u2026 Yes. I know. I wept for a day. You wept for a day. And then cried for a night. The Republic of Ireland voting to legalize same sex marriage, but I think \u2014 this Catholic country. I mean, before it happened in the United States, I believe. And yet, because of who you are, and where your \u201Chere\u201D is from year to year, you are right in the thick of this \u2014 the spectrum of how \u2014 this encounter, this awakening. So, you\u2019ve been in places like Uganda, where you are, in fact, talking about these things, about sexual identity and how churches respond to that, where you have very actively stayed in the closet, in fact, felt that you would be \u2014 were pretty sure \u2014 you would be unsafe. Yeah, yeah. It was more than just feeling; it was just the truth. Right. And you talked about this Christian community that you were part of for many years where you felt deeply loved. Was that the same one that also tried \u2014 made you undergo exorcisms? Yeah, totally. And reparative therapy too. And I mean, that is an important part of my story that, for a year, I went weekly to reparative therapy, change therapy, or some way within which somebody who\u2019d done a weekend course somewhere thought that they could call themselves a counselor now. And I was 19, and frightened, and thought this might help, and was told this is the kind of thing that will help. And what \u2014 this is a slight precursor, but language was the thing that saved me. Because I remember, at one point, plucking up the courage to say to this therapist or whatever he was being called professionally, \u201CI\u2019m not even sure I want to want to have sex with a woman,\u201D because he was \u2014 it was so erotically focused in the sense of the kind of the mechanics of what success would look like. That was the awful thing. And I was trying to put that into language. And he said, \u201CThat\u2019s because you\u2019re saying really poor sentences.\u201D And he goes, \u201CWhat you should be\u201D \u2014 and little did he know, the idiot. But he said, \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t be saying \u2018have sex with a woman.\u2019 You should say, \u2018I want to give sex to a woman.\u2019\u201D And I remember thinking, \u201CThat is a terrible sentence.\u201D In terms of a conjugation of a verb into a sentence, that fails. And I had been through three exorcisms in the year previous to that, and had gone to this \u2014 I used to get the number 16 bus from the north side to the south side of Dublin, petrified, and leave burdened, like with a damp blanket of dismay on me. And I said to him, \u201CThat\u2019s not a good sentence.\u201D I never went back. And that was the exorcism. It was amazing. I remember getting back on the number 16 bus elated with delight, and I had no one to tell, because to tell anybody about this exorcism into freedom would have been to have caused complication in terms of that. And so I\u2019m really \u2014 it\u2019s important to recognize, I think, when it comes to LGBT people\u2019s identities, causation, cure, and consequence are some of the public fixations around people who are cautious about the inclusion or the pace of change. But I am bored often by ways in which it can turn into something where I have received insult, where I then give insult back. I have never had a situation where that\u2019s been fruitful, much and all as it might feel lovely for me afterwards, or somewhat vindicating. It isn\u2019t fruitful. It doesn\u2019t help to bring about change. So, I suppose I\u2019ve been really interested in curating spaces of dialogue. And here in Ireland, and Scotland, and the States, and Australia, and England, as well as in Uganda, where people who believe very deeply that their faith and their social conscience causes them to be concerned, that there is the possibility within the Gospels for us to be brought into a deeper kind of belonging with each other. So, in Uganda, we looked at this text of the woman in Luke chapter 7 who makes her way into the house of Simon the Pharisee. And she was not welcome, but she actually did the duties of the host. And it\u2019s amazing because Jesus would have been lounging on the floor. And then in Greek, it says he turned to her and spoke to Simon, who would have been the host. His head was now to the host, turning to this woman. And he says to Simon, \u201CDo you see this woman? And what do you see?\u201D And these are the ways in which the Gospel text calls us to look around us in an amazing way. And once \u2014 in one of these encounters, there was an amazing situation where about 9 or 10 of us in a room, people who had chosen to come and to \u2014 they came from fairly \u2014 with deep caution about lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans people. And where was this? This was in Belfast. In Belfast, yeah. And at the end of the two-day encounter, one of the men who had \u2014 he had chosen the word \u201Cfundamentalist\u201D for himself to describe himself as a Christian. And he said, \u201CI have a question for all the homosexuals in the room.\u201D And part of me wanted to go, \u201CWe don\u2019t like that word.\u201D But anyway, I thought, \u201CLet\u2019s hear the question first,\u201D because \u2014 you know. And he says, \u201CI want to know how many times since we\u2019ve met together in the last while, have my words bruised you.\u201D And somebody next to me went, \u201CAh, you\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re very nice.\u201D And he said, \u201CNo. Don\u2019t patronize me. How many times have my words bruised you?\u201D And the fellow next to me started to count, \u201COne, two, three, four.\u201D And then he goes, \u201CI\u2019ve given up after the first hour.\u201D And then this man, who had gone to the edges of his own understanding and asked others to help populate that edge with information and insight, said, \u201CAre you telling me that it\u2019s painful for you to be around me?\u201D And somebody went \u2014 a woman in the room went, \u201CYeah, it is.\u201D And he was the one who chaplained himself into that space. And I couldn\u2019t have made that happen. As the facilitator of the room, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 like if I had said, \u201CDo you realize that your words are bruising?\u201D none of that would have been sufficient. Because what he was being brought into was the transformative power of human encounter in relationship. We were un-residential. And curiously, he had asked \u2014 we were talking a few nights previously about television, and he was saying that his absolute favorite show was this political show on the BBC on a Thursday night. And I said, \u201CMy partner produces that.\u201D And he was like, \u201CWhat?\u201D And then he went through all the names because he\u2019s that kind of a geek that he knew all the names of the production team. He knew all the names. Right. And he mentioned him by name, mentioned Paul by name. And then suddenly, he was like, \u201CDo they enjoy it?\u201D And he had all this information that he wanted to ask, and curiosity unfolded between us. And I think that, and shared cups of tea, was one of the things that contributed to the fact that he demonstrated, and I was converted by, his capacity to ask that question. I came away just going \u2014 I want in the ways in which I\u2019m the perpetrator of real hostility and lack of understanding and lazy thinking. I want to be someone like him, who says, \u201CTell me what it\u2019s like to hear the way I talk because I need to be changed.\u201D I went also to be converted in terms of that. But you know, I think that also speaks to another idea that you and I have discussed and explored together, and that\u2019s come up in these days in Northern Ireland, which is the urgency of creating spaces where that kind of human connection can be made. Even just that normalizing thing of, \u201COh, I know the TV show that your partner works on,\u201D which wasn\u2019t about the issue, but it flowed into the relationship, but also, where you could come to that moment of conversion for both of you. I mean, that \u2014 Corrymeela is a place, is the creation of a place where people whose lives were threatened during the Troubles literally fled here, physically, to be safe. I think what you\u2019re talking about is so relevant and resonant for American life right now. And one thing I experience is that people long to begin \u2014 they want to be having those kinds of encounters in their communities, like, where they live, very close to home. And they don\u2019t know how to start. And this question of getting the right people in the room \u2014 how would you start to give some counsel on that from what you know? I suppose Corrymeela\u2019s practice for all those years has been to be a place of story, and that within that, the society, the religion, the politics, the pain, are all held within those stories. They don\u2019t exist in abstract way. These concepts like civic society exist in people, next to people, next to people, next to people. And sometimes that\u2019s a very fractious experience. And one of the things that I think is really important for lots of organizations of goodwill, and Corrymeela is one of them amongst many in Northern Ireland \u2013 that\u2019s really an important thing to say \u2014 is the recognition to say, \u201CWhere are the limitations of our understanding?\u201D \u201CDo we have friendships?\u201D And I really appreciate when people contact so \u2014 the question, often, is to say, \u201CAre there human connection points where quietly you can say to people, \u2018Can you help me understand this?\u2019\u201D And maybe then you\u2019ll participate in this fantastic argument of being alive in such a dynamic way that it\u2019s great fun or really enlivening. And you can have a really robust disagreement. And that is the opposite of being frightened of fear because you can create that. When Corrymeela began in \u201865, somebody who didn\u2019t have a great understanding of old Irish etymology had said, \u201COh, \u2018Corrymeela\u2019 means \u2018hill of harmony.\u2019\u201D And people were like, \u201CHow lovely. Amazing. Hill of harmony. Isn\u2019t that delightful?\u201D And about 10 years later, somebody who actually knew what they were talking about when it came to old Irish etymology said, \u201CWell, it\u2019s kind of like \u2019place of lumpy crossings.\u2019\u201D And by that stage, there\u2019d been 10 years. And people were like, \u201COh, thank god.\u201D \u201CThe place can hold us still because we haven\u2019t been great at harmony apart from the occasional song.\u201D Yeah, well, who is? Yeah, but that gives \u2014 and people do sometimes say \u2014 when we\u2019re in community discussions, say, \u201CThis is a bit of a lumpy crossing for us.\u201D And it gives space and permission to say, \u201CYeah it is.\u201D And actually that\u2019s \u2014 even the naming of that is part of what might help us and be a lovely, wise understanding about what success is because that, in itself, is a really good place to get to, to say the \u201Chere\u201D is that this is difficult. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in Northern Ireland with theologian, poet, and social healer P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama. You mentioned at one point that \u2014 I think you say that you didn\u2019t love the book The Zen \u2014 what is it? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. But that there\u2019s this word\u2026 One lovely word, yeah. One word\u2026 I\u2019ve been reading Henri Nouwen, and I thought, \u201CWhen I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, I will become as wise as Henri Nouwen.\u201D And then I read the book, and I was like, \u201DI\u2019m bored,\u201D partly because I don\u2019t understand motorcycles. Yeah. So I suppose that was the beginning. I should have paid attention to that. But this one word, mu. Mu. M-U. There\u2019s a Buddhist concept where, if you\u2019re asking a poor question \u2014 if a question is being asked, go, \u201CAre you this or that?\u201D That what Robert Pirsig says that you can answer, according to his telling of the Zen tradition, you can answer with this word mu, M-U, which means, \u201CUn-ask the question, because there\u2019s a better question to be asked.\u201D The question that\u2019s asking is limiting, and you\u2019ll get no good answer from anything. This question fails us, never mind subsequent answers. And I think that\u2019s a really delightful way to understand the world. And I think questions about Jesus sometimes that are posed in our public rhetoric about Christianity \u2014 \u201CWhat do we do here?\u201D \u201CWhat do we do there?\u201D \u201CIs this right?\u201D \u201CIs that right?\u201D \u201CAm I allowed to be gay and Christian?\u201D for instance, was the question that plagued me for years. And I think that in a certain sense, we\u2019re being told by God, perhaps in silence in our prayers, \u201CMu,\u201D because there\u2019s better questions to ask. And asking a wiser question might unfold us into asking even more, wiser questions, whereas certain kinds of questions just entrench fear. Yeah. Well, also wiser questions will elicit wiser responses. Yes. Yeah. You\u2019re right. And so that will lead us together down a different road. Totally. And maybe towards each other, and into human encounter, and into the possibility of saying, \u201CI will learn something from somebody.\u201D I used to be a school chaplain in West Belfast, and I trained, and I did some Ignatian spirituality training. And we used to do reflections on \u2014 prayer reflections with 11-year-old, West Belfast, hilarious young people. And we\u2019d gather around and light a candle and have a prayer bowl, and just create a little bit of quiet. And then we\u2019d do an imaginative Ignatian reflection where the young people would take a walk with Jesus. And it was only a year that I had that job, and that year, I loved that job because every day I thought, \u201CI\u2019m going to meet Jesus as curated and narrated by 11-year-olds from West Belfast.\u201D And they were hilarious. One young girl said, \u201CYeah, Jesus came walking over the water wearing a purple tutu and a coconut bra.\u201D I thought, \u201COh my god.\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s not the Jesus that I know.\u201D And then for \u2014 they have to make a drawing for the Bishop. And she said, \u201CI\u2019m not very good at drawing.\u201D I was like, \u201CThank God because I\u2019d like to keep my job.\u201D Maybe it was for me. The other kinds of story \u2014 and I think these were younger kids in a different setting in which you were teaching \u2014 you also got this question, \u201CP\u00E1draig, does God love us?\u201D Oh, yes. That was actually in the same job. Yeah. So why did he create Protestants? She was hilarious. She was one of my favorites. She was amazing at football, and she just said everything that she thought. I was wittering on about something, and she was clearly bored, and she goes, \u201CP\u00E1draig, answer me a question.\u201D And I went, \u201COK.\u201D And she goes, \u201CGod loves us, right?\u201D I went, \u201COK.\u201D She was setting out her premise. And then I said, \u201COK. I\u2019m with you.\u201D She was a philosopher. Yeah, totally. And then she goes, \u201CAnd God made us, right?\u201D OK. I knew that these weren\u2019t the really important questions. And then she goes, \u201CAnswer me this: why did God make Protestants?\u201D I said, \u201CYou have to tell me a bit more about your question.\u201D And she goes, \u201CWell, they hate us, and they hate him.\u201D And because I knew she was brilliant at football, I said, \u201CI know a lot of Protestants that would want you on their football team.\u201D And she went, \u201CReally?\u201D Because her \u2014 she, in that little half-comedic, half-frightening incident, is telling a story of an entire society. Because she has been educated, and she\u2019s reflecting something \u2014 this was only \u2014 this is 2011. So this was 13 years after the Good Friday Agreement had been signed. She hadn\u2019t been born when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. And nonetheless, these are ways in which these stories \u2014 and you mentioned sectarianism earlier on, and one of the best definitions of sectarianism comes from a book by Cecelia Clegg and Joe Liechty, and they say, \u201CSectarianism is belonging gone bad.\u201D Belonging gone bad. Gone bad. And they \u2014 in that book, you mention\u2026 The scale of sectarianism. The scale. And so what is that? And the scale\u2026 The scale for them begins \u2014 I think there\u2019s about 14 or 15 points. The first part of the scale is going, \u201CYou\u2019re different. I\u2019m different.\u201D Fine. And the 15th point is, \u201CYou\u2019re demonic.\u201D And that\u2019s the word they use in all the scales down to that \u2014 one of the pieces\u2026 And the farther down that scale you go, the more violence\u2026 The more danger. Yeah. Dangerous it becomes. The more you justify it, because if somebody is the devil, well, then you get rid of them, generally. One of the scales \u2014 and that is, \u201CIn order for me to be right, it is important that I believe that you are wrong.\u201D And ways within which that is really alive to how it is. And I think what you\u2019ve been saying in terms of recognizing that, fragile and limited as our process has been here, Northern Ireland has transformed itself and involved in that has been \u2014 politicians, and peacemakers, and victims, and perpetrators, and all these limited words like that. People who have said, \u201CI was caught up in something,\u201D and have now given extraordinary contributions. So many people of goodwill, and courage, and protest saying, \u201CWe can find a way to live well together.\u201D And this can be the hope. And that\u2019s very hopeful\u2026 It is. \u2026to think that you have collectively \u2014 including people who were violent, who were \u2014 \u201Cterrorists\u201D is one of those words, but who actually collectively moved from that place on the spectrum of demonizing others back towards, not necessarily agreeing or loving in terms of feeling jubilant in each other\u2019s presence, but making that move\u2026 And giving committed guarantees to the other\u2019s safety. And finding ways in which we can say, \u201CThis can be a place where our disagreements will happen in a tone that is wiser, and in a tone that is safer.\u201D And I think that\u2019s a really helpful place to be. I mean, because the implication that to agree with each other is what guarantees safety is immediately undermined by every experience of family \u2014 like, we just know that. And friendships \u2014 that\u2019s what we know. Agreement has rarely been the mandate for people who love each other. Maybe on some things, but actually, when you look at some people who are lovers and friends, you go actually they might disagree really deeply on things, but they\u2019re somehow \u2014 I like the phrase \u201Cthe argument of being alive.\u201D Or in Irish, when you talk about trust, there\u2019s a beautiful phrase from West Kerry where you say, \u201CMo sheasamh ort l\u00E1 na choise tinne,\u201D \u201CYou are the place where I stand on the day when my feet are sore.\u201D And that is soft and kind language, but it is so robust. That is what we can have with each other. And it\u2019s so physical, that beautiful understanding. And you can find that with each other, even when you think different things about what jurisdiction we are or should be in. You can find you\u2019re the place where I stand on the day when my feet are sore with each other. And that is soft and kind language, but it is so robust. And it is part of the firmament that upholds what it means to be human. That is what we can have with each other. And we are failed by headlines that just demonize the other and are lazy. And where I might read a headline about myself and go, \u201CI don\u2019t recognize myself in the language that\u2019s being spoken about there,\u201D we are failed by that. But we are upheld by something that has a quality of deep virtues of kindness, of goodness, of curiosity, and the jostle and enjoyment of saying, \u201CYeah, we disagree.\u201D But that curates something, and in a psychological context, contains something that actually is a vessel of deep safety and community. OK. I\u2019m going to skip over all of my other brilliant questions. I just want to read this \u2014 on the power of the idea of belonging: \u201CIt creates and undoes us both.\u201D And you also wrote, \u201CIf spirituality does not speak to this power, then it speaks to little.\u201D I think what I\u2019d love for you to do is read the very end of your book. And I have it \u2014 or you have it. Right here. OK. So it would be starting at, yeah, \u201CNeither I nor the poets I love\u2026\u201D Sure. \u201CNeither I nor the poets I love found the keys to the kingdom of prayer and we cannot force God to stumble over us where we sit. But I know that it\u2019s a good idea to sit anyway. So every morning I sit, I kneel, waiting, making friends with the habit of listening, hoping that I\u2019m being listened to. There, I greet God in my own disorder. I say hello to my chaos, my unmade decisions, my unmade bed, my desire and my trouble. I say hello to distraction and privilege, I greet the day and I greet my beloved and bewildering Jesus. I recognise and greet my burdens, my luck, my controlled and uncontrollable story. I greet my untold stories, my unfolding story, my unloved body, my own love, my own body. I greet the things I think will happen and I say hello to everything I do not know about the day. I greet my own small world and I hope that I can meet the bigger world that day. I greet my story and hope that I can forget my story during the day, and hope that I can hear some stories, and greet some surprising stories during the long day ahead. I greet God, and I greet the God who is more God than the God I greet. / Hello to you all, I say, as the sun rises above the chimneys of North Belfast. / Hello.\u201D I don\u2019t know if we need a question. I would, though \u2014 when I read that, I\u2019ll just be really honest and say \u2014 oh, here\u2019s something I didn\u2019t say that\u2019s honest that I still want to say to you. It\u2019s a bit \u2014 becomes so clear in your book, especially, that you\u2019re so hard on yourself. Like\u2026 Oh, really? Right? And you tell that story about your friend Rory, who says\u2026 Oh yeah. \u2026\u201CHere\u2019s the one thing I know about you, P\u00E1draig, you always make things more difficult.\u201D Yeah, yeah. And I was prepared for him to \u2014 I was prepared with great modesty to receive a compliment in that situation. He undid me. Yeah. And you are one of these people \u2014 and I recognize myself a little bit in you \u2014 you bring a lot of solace to other people and hope to other people, but you\u2019ve struggled a lot. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And I was very curious \u2014 I just love those pages. I loved that image of you praying and how you pray. Yeah. I do love praying. Like prier from French, \u201Cto ask.\u201D And what I love about that word is it doesn\u2019t require belief. It just requires a recognition of need. And I think the recognition of need is something that brings us to a deep, common language about what it means to be human. And if you don\u2019t \u2014 if you\u2019re not in the situation where you know need, well, then you\u2019re lucky. But you will be. That won\u2019t last for too long. Need is happening in so many ways, in so many levels, in people and in societies and in communities. And I suppose I really think that prayer is also not only naming or asking, but just saying hello to what is and trying to be brave, trying to be courageous in that situation and trying to be generous to your own self, also. To go, \u201CHere\u2019s a day when I feel intimidated,\u201D or \u201CHere\u2019s the day; I\u2019m just waiting for the end of it,\u201D or \u201CHere\u2019s the day when I have huge expectations of delight,\u201D because those can also be troubling. And Ignatius cautions people to have an active detachment, recognizing the things that will cause you great distress, as well as things that can cause you great delight, can be things that distract you from what he calls your principle and foundation, which I suppose I ultimately understand as love. And that that is the principle and foundation of the human project, of the human story, of the human encounter, is to move toward each other in love. And to find \u2014 like, in Corrymeela, we talk about living well together. That that is the vision we have, to live well together. That doesn\u2019t mean to agree. That doesn\u2019t mean that everything will be perfect. It means to say that in the context of imperfection and difficulty, we can find the capacity and the skill, as well as the generosity and courtesy, to live well together. And I think by \u2014 in the morning times, I say hello to all those things, and then I try to say hello a little bit to what I know won\u2019t happen. And in that sense, prayer becomes a way within which you cultivate curiosity and the sense of wonder. So that you know I\u2019ll be returning back to this and can say hello tomorrow to something that I wouldn\u2019t have even known about today. That\u2019s how I understand prayer in that way. Every now and then, Jesus shows up and says something interesting. Ms. Tippet: Through the Gospel. I read the Gospels in Irish too because there\u2019s something about reading the text in Irish. I love the richness of the etymology. And certain phrases that \u2014 actually, it\u2019s difficult enough to say in Irish the way within which \u2014 like, in Ireland, I think we have this understanding of, \u201CWhy use five words when you can use 50?\u201D So sometimes, the texts are longer than they would be in Greek or English. But it\u2019s a lovely thing to do in that sense because you realize the way these translators have found a way to say something that really unfolds something really delightful. Thank you so much. It\u2019s a joy, Krista. Thank you. It\u2019s a joy. Thank you. P\u00E1draig \u00D3 Tuama is the community leader of Corrymeela, Northern Ireland\u2019s oldest peace and reconciliation organization.
