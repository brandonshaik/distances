  "fullText": "Doris Taylor is a pioneer on a scientific frontier of regeneration, innovating a process to bring the organs and tissues of dead animals back to life. This might one day revolutionize transplantation of human hearts, livers, and more. And it\u2019s made possible by stem cells, which Doris Taylor explains as a new and dramatic discovery about the human body that\u2019s been obscured by politicized debates over a narrow slice of her field. She says we might\u2019ve avoided those debates altogether if we had found different vocabulary to discuss stems cells in public at the outset: distinguishing between fetal and embryonic cells, explaining the origins of the cells used in research, and illuminating the larger story of stem cells. Stem cells, as Doris Taylor knows them, are a powerful reality we\u2019re all living with day to day, hour to hour. Understanding them better, she says, may change our approach to aging, cancer, and simply making our bodies work better for us \u2014 at eight or 80. From American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today on Being, \u201CStem Cells: Untold Stories.\u201D In January 2008, Doris Taylor\u2019s work at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Cardiovascular Repair was the stuff of global headlines \u2014 such as \u201CResearchers Grow a Beating Heart.\u201D Simply explained, Doris Taylor and her colleagues took the heart from the cadaver of a rat and injected stem cells into it. It came to life, and made history. Doris Taylor\u2019s work almost seems the stuff of science fiction and it approaches the religious terrain of resurrection. But it\u2019s not so different, she says, from other great scientific leaps forward. Twenty years ago, if we had said we were going to map the human genome, 20 years ago when we did say we were going to map the human genome, it was viewed as almost impossible. Fifty years ago computers filled up this room. It\u2019s all the same story; it\u2019s just we\u2019re talking about our bodies and we find that much more mysterious. And we find it much more mysterious because they are alive. I spoke with Doris Taylor in 2009. She began pondering healing writ large at an early age. She grew up in Mississippi in the era of civil rights; she\u2019s said that no one could come of age in Mississippi when she did and not want to make the world a better place. She also grew up with a twin brother with cerebral palsy, which may have influenced her move towards medical research as a way to make the world a better place. But Doris Taylor arrived at her work with cells and the heart indirectly. I wanted to specialize actually in mind/brain neuro stuff, and the department I was in at the time in graduate school said, \u201CThat field isn\u2019t advanced enough for you to really do that.\u201D So I started studying muscle, and I started studying the interactions between nerve and muscle because it was about as close as I could get. We were looking at the whole \u2014 all the genes that exist and get turned on in muscle in your arm, in your leg, and in your heart, and realized that your heart\u2019s just the ultimate muscle. And then when we started talking about what happens after a heart attack and the fact that your heart can\u2019t repair itself, it, in a natural way, made sense to start thinking about cells from your skeletal muscle to do that. And that\u2019s how my career really happened. So I want to talk a little bit about your great discovery, or your accomplishment. It\u2019s interesting to me because I\u2019ve noticed that in shorthand when people talk about it, they\u2019ll sometimes say that you made a heart. Right. But what I saw, as I really dug into you and what you said about your work and really understanding it, it was very interesting. One of the things that I\u2019ve been fascinated in, in my conversations with scientists in general is how scientists have such a regard for beauty. Right. And, say, physicists find mathematical equations beautiful. And I was really struck in your descriptions of what you did by how you found the heart, the architecture of the heart, beautiful. Right. And so in fact you didn\u2019t make a heart; you worked with that structure. Right. Right. The heart is a beautiful organ. It\u2019s a complex, beautiful organ. And when I was at Duke, we started trying to, quote, \u201Cregenerate\u201D a heart. And we started that using cells and realized pretty quickly that cells were probably not going to be enough for people who already have heart failure, end-stage heart failure; that you really need a heart. And trying to build a heart sure seemed complicated to me. And there was a fellow in my lab, his name was Harold, and Harold and I were talking about how it\u2019d be really cool if we could figure out a way to take cells out and put cells back in. Well, what we did is we realized what do you need to build an organ? You need three things. You need cells, but cells alone don\u2019t make an organ. They just hang out in a dish and beat. And you need a place to put those cells. Give them a context. And then you need a way to feed those cells. Well, nature\u2019s already created that. Nature\u2019s created a heart. And the simplicity of what we did, really, is take a heart from a cadaver and literally use soap. Pretty simple. The same soap that\u2019s in shampoo, actually. Right. And wash the cells, using the blood supply to that organ, literally drip soap through it. So wash out all the dead cells. So you wash out all the cells from the cadaver organ and what\u2019s left is literally the framework. It actually looks a lot like Jell-O. The heart, devoid of cells, looks like Jell-O? I should\u2019ve brought one. I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s actually beautiful. And yet it looks like a heart. It\u2019s got the shape of a heart, the architecture of a heart. You can see where the blood vessels would be. It\u2019s pretty remarkable. And at a very simplistic level, it\u2019s \u2014 we call it a \u201Cghost heart.\u201D It\u2019s a skeleton of a heart. Then you can add cells back. And that\u2019s what we did. In truth, we just did a very crude version of what nature does. We took that scaffold, added cells back, and they did what they know how to do, which is beat and pump. Now I know that this is true of every scientific discovery, that the breakthrough is the culmination of lots of years of work and trial and error and failure. But you did finally have this experience that you had cleaned the heart, you injected it, and then eight days later \u2026 You know, I\u2019ve had two \u201Cwow\u201D moments in my life. The first one was when we transplanted cells in the heart for the first time. And we looked at one of those hearts \u2014 we looked at a section of one of those hearts \u2014 and there was a big island of new cells in the heart. And it was like, wow, yes. Well, the second yes moment in my life is Harold and Thomas were in the lab late at night and they called me. \u201CDoris, it\u2019s beating.\u201D I was in my office, and they were like, \u201CDoris, it\u2019s beating.\u201D You just kind of sit there for a minute and you kind of \u2014 you know, I was like, \u201CShow me!\u201D And that moment when you see that, I mean, literally, it was one of those, oh my god. Because it really wasn\u2019t that complicated, and on the other hand, there were so many things that could\u2019ve gone wrong. There are so many steps along the way. And, wow. And wow. Because what that means is it\u2019s possible. And what somebody said recently, and it makes a lot of sense, is we did it first, but now a lot of people are going to do this. And we hope we\u2019ve opened a door to a new field of building tissues and organs for people who need them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, on Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, faith, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CStem Cells: Untold Stories.\u201D We had to see Doris Taylor\u2019s hearts in various stages of regeneration for ourselves \u2014 and on our website you can see them too. Join me on a tour through Doris Taylor\u2019s lab. See elaborate architectural glass bulbs with tubes feeding suspended rodent hearts \u2014 one lifeless with old cells; another one stage farther, a pale \u201Cscaffold\u201D ready for stem cells to be injected; and finally, a regenerated heart, pink, pumping, alive, and beating on its own. That\u2019s all at onbeing.org. Family members of people who could benefit from her research have told Doris Taylor that she\u2019s not just building organs; she\u2019s building hope. Yet the very notion of stem cells, which makes her work possible, became a divisive flashpoint in politicized divides of recent years. Doris Taylor takes the human and moral concerns that her science raises very seriously. She\u2019s said publicly that these were inflamed, in part, by simple miscommunication and misunderstanding of the facts. I thought I would give you an opportunity here. I wonder if you would tell me how, if you could rewind the discussion and you could introduce this notion of the work you do and the field you\u2019re in \u2026 Sure. \u2026 and the whole idea of stem cells, how would you start? How would you explain what this is, what it means? You know, stem cells are really very simple. They\u2019re cells that can do two things: They can make more of themselves or self-renew, and they can, quote \u201Cdifferentiate,\u201D become a lot of different things, differentiate. And, really, we have stem cells everywhere in our body. I\u2019ve said before and you may have heard me say, I believe aging is a failure of stem cells. That every organ or tissue in our body for the most part has stem cells in it. So there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. But I think the fear is that \u2014 well, I mean, let\u2019s be frank. The word that\u2019s used is embryonic stem cell, and the concept is that we\u2019re taking fetuses and using those to create cells for medicine. That is just not true. Fetal cells are already muscle, already heart, already lung. They\u2019re not stem cells anymore. Right. They\u2019ve already developed into a given tissue, organ, whatever. Embryonic stem cells are cells that come from a fertilized egg before any of that differentiation occurs. Fetal stem cells are too old to be used for what we do. What we\u2019re really using are fertilized eggs. And you\u2019re using fertilized eggs that have been donated to research from in vitro fertilization experiments. Right. Right. And that\u2019s a whole different situation. If you think about it, what\u2019s the alternative with those fertilized eggs? They\u2019re going to be stored until they\u2019re no longer needed. And when they\u2019re no longer needed, what happens to them? We don\u2019t talk about that. My understanding is they go in the trash. They\u2019re destroyed. My personal, ethical, and moral belief is the universe gives us tools to use and we\u2019re taught things that we need to learn along the way. And I can\u2019t turn my back on this wonderful opportunity to learn how nature builds things. Embryonic stem cells, quote/unquote, have the potential to become almost any tissue. What that means is that I can take these cells from a fertilized egg \u2014 what do they do? Like every other cell, they divide. So once they make about eight cells or 10 cells, we can begin to take those cells and watch them as they mature into something that looks like a piece of heart, or looks like a piece of muscle, or looks like a piece of skin. Now I think that\u2019s an incredible learning opportunity. In addition, what we don\u2019t talk about is there are a number of fertilized eggs from in vitro fertilization that we know have genetic diseases. Those are never going to be implanted. And wouldn\u2019t it be fabulous if we could understand how the man I was talking with the other day developed heart failure because we could study cells from a fertilized egg where that same genetic difference occurred, and we knew those cells were going to grow up and have heart failure? I think you\u2019re right, that at least the impression that has been given, whether this was intentional or not, or spelled out or not, was that the embryos in embryonic stem cell research \u2026 Come from \u2026 \u2026 had something to do with abortion. Right. Or could have something to do with abortion. And I know that you have spent time over these last years in conversation with religious people who have this kind of moral perspective on this issue. Right. I wonder, did they make a distinction morally between the use of aborted fetuses and \u2026 No. \u2026 fertilized eggs that are going to be discarded anyway through in vitro fertilization clinics? You know, the general perception on the street \u2014 when I\u2019ve talked to people at churches, when I\u2019ve gone to give stem cell talks at churches, is \u201CWow. I thought people had abortions and you used those cells.\u201D It\u2019s simply not true. You know, the reaction is about fear and misperception. And my experience has been when you tell people what\u2019s really happening and you tell people what\u2019s really going on and you talk to someone who\u2019s kid or brother or sister or mother or father has a disease, they start realizing that we\u2019re just talking about another tool that we\u2019ve all been given to use. Here\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t really understand until I started looking into your work, and this is where I think, understandably, fear come from. It seems to me that the discovery of stem cells is one of those discoveries almost like DNA that forces us to think differently about what we\u2019re made of and how our bodies work. It\u2019s so new. Right. I mean, this is something I didn\u2019t understand. That it\u2019s new knowledge. That we all have a billion stem cells \u2026 Right. \u2026 in our bodies as adults. Right. Think about it, though. For most of our lives, our bodies repair themselves. You know, I have an e-mail address that\u2019s called stemcellsrus because it\u2019s really about the fact that stem cells are really pretty simple, as I said. They exist all the time until we get old enough that they don\u2019t anymore. And I can tell you, that for most of us as we age, we wish we had more of them, not fewer. So are stem cells involved in the fact that, say, when my 11-year-old son bangs his head at least once a week or scratches his knees to pieces \u2026 Right. \u2026 they get better? He doesn\u2019t have a scar forever, does he? Right. Right. And that\u2019s because our organs and tissues have stem cells that can repair them. I call that endogenous repair, internal repair. And that\u2019s what I meant when I said aging is really a failure of stem cells. For most of our lives, we have stem cells in all of our organs or tissues that can heal them. And they do so by taking care of that normal wear and tear. But as you get to be 52, 62, 72 and you fall down and you scrape your knee, you may have a scar for the rest of your life because as we age the number of stem cells we have goes down and the function of the ones that we have decreases. There\u2019s a real correlation in your work to stem cells as a normal part of health and across the lifespan. They are. They are. You know, the whole notion of, quote, \u201Ccell therapy,\u201D which is being used \u2014 what was the first cell therapy that was ever used? It happened here in Minnesota in the \u201960s. It was bone marrow transplant. We would harvest bone marrow, right, and when somebody had cancer, we would wipe out their bone marrow and give them new bone marrow. And we used to think that we were just giving them the cells that were going to make new blood and new \u2014 new blood, basically. What we now know is that the bone marrow is full of stem cells. OK. So essentially those same cells that we used to call bone marrow cells we now call bone marrow stem cells or bone marrow progenitor cells. I see. And it just means that the science has caught up and our knowledge has caught up with what nature has been doing all along. Which is making sure we had cells that could repair our organs and tissues. You\u2019ve got billions of them in your bones right now. You\u2019ve got billions of \u2014 do you know that you can even derive stem cells from baby teeth? From the inside of baby teeth? There are stem cells being derived from \u2014 I mean, we could go down a whole laundry list. Urine. Blood. Bone. Skin. Yes. Skin. Are stem cells why skin heals and \u2014 I mean, skin is constantly turning over. Essentially all of our organs and tissues turn over. It\u2019s that whole average wear and tear that we go through. And then ultimately if we take enough hits for a long enough period of time, we start running out of cells. OK. And that\u2019s, you know, we talk about high-risk behavior. It gives it a whole different meaning when you think about the fact that, you know, those cheeseburgers aren\u2019t just about cholesterol, they\u2019re about the wear and tear on the inside of our blood vessels over time. Really? When you join our tour of Doris Taylor\u2019s laboratory on our website, speakingoffaith.org, you\u2019ll hear more of her reflections on the more human side of her work, and you can see me holding a ghost heart, as she calls it, a gelatinous pig\u2019s heart stripped of its cells. Also see a pulsing rodent heart suspended in a network of glass tubes she calls a \u201Cbioreactor.\u201D So this is a heart that\u2019s just starting the process. Looks like a heart. Yeah. But it\u2019s obviously dead because it\u2019s not beating, it\u2019s not alive. It\u2019s actually got soap going through it to wash the cells out. And here\u2019s one that is in the process of being rebuilt. It\u2019s obviously a lot more complicated than the scaffold alone because it\u2019s got to have oxygen, it\u2019s got to have what we call artificial blood. It\u2019s getting the food in it to expand and act like a heart. All this and more at onbeing.org. After a short break, more conversation with Doris Taylor, including what we\u2019re learning about stem cells that can help us reverse that wear and tear of life\u2019s cheeseburgers. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. This program comes to you from American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today on Being \u2014 \u201CStem Cells: Untold Stories.\u201D We\u2019re meeting Doris Taylor who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Repair at the University of Minnesota. She made history \u2014 and Time\u2018s 2009 list of the \u201CWorld\u2019s 100 Most Influential People\u201D \u2014 after she and her colleagues innovated a process that uses stem cells to bring the organs of dead animals back to life. Doris Taylor believes that stem cells will be key to our developing understanding of health at every level across the lifespan in the years to come. To that end, she\u2019s been involved with the field of integrative medicine at the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota. She\u2019s also worked on studies based at Duke University and elsewhere to measure the potential physical cellular benefits of spiritual technologies like prayer and meditation. As we continue to learn how stem cells function, grow, and wane in human bodies, Doris Taylor insists, we can also learn how to increase their function, even using them to reverse aging and disease. This is the frontier known as regenerative or reparative medicine. Finally, our knowledge has caught up with \u2014 or is catching up with biology. We don\u2019t understand it all yet. We don\u2019t understand what makes them decrease but we know we can begin to move people backwards. And can I tell you some cool stuff? We believe that things that decrease stress actually increase the number of stem cells that you have in your body and in your blood. And we know that men and women have different numbers and different kinds of stem cells. And so for the first time, we think we can begin to understand why it is that men develop heart disease earlier than women \u2014 because they lose their stem cells faster. So wouldn\u2019t it be fabulous if we could say, \u201CWait a minute. We can move you backwards on that continuum of disease.\u201D And I think that\u2019s the future. The future is really using nature\u2019s tools to promote our body\u2019s ability to heal itself, whether we do that with traditional medical approaches, giving you cells, giving you molecules that increase the number of stem cells in a controlled way, or whether it\u2019s about teaching you tools that let your body do that. Right. Meditation, whatever. Yeah. And in that context \u2014 so here\u2019s a paradox that strikes me in your work when I read a description of your laboratory where you have a number of hearts beating, right? So there\u2019s something about this idea of disembodied hearts that then starts to make me worry about then how we define what we are. Absolutely. Right? But then the irony is that one of the things you\u2019re discovering is that one of the ways our whole organism has to increase this capacity, this efficiency of stem cells, are through what I call these spiritual technologies like meditation. So, in fact, you take the things apart and then see how they fit together again. You know, it\u2019s interesting because when we were first doing the guys in the lab would sleep in the lab to check on these hearts every half-hour or hour and a half. And when one of my folks who\u2019s in my lab now came into the lab and was learning this process, Thomas \u2014 who was in the lab before \u2014 said, \u201CYou\u2019ve just got to love it enough to keep it going.\u201D Was he talking about the hearts? He was talking about the hearts \u2026 Right. \u2026 that we were growing in a dish. And, you know, we joke about that but at the same time, I think part of what we\u2019re doing is learning about regenerating heart at a lot of different levels. And I think as we learn more about transplanting these hearts, what makes what we\u2019re doing a little bit different than what exists out there already is we would \u2014 if we wanted to build you a heart, we would take a cadaver scaffold from a pig or from a human that couldn\u2019t otherwise be used as a transplant. But we would take your stem cells, and we would use your cells to grow that heart. So it\u2019s really about putting your body\u2019s ability to heal you back in place. And then the way I understand it is you also see part of what you would want me to learn in terms of nurturing \u2026 Right. \u2026 that repair forward would also \u2014 there would also be a spiritual component to that. I mean, I personally have to believe that there\u2019s a spiritual component to all of this. What we think impacts who we are. We know that. We know that, whether it\u2019s what we think makes us grumpy or what we think makes us happy. And we\u2019re learning that those have an impact on our physical body. Stress ages your stem cells. There\u2019s science out there from some of the best laboratories in the world showing that the way a cell knows how old it is, is it has a little piece of DNA, chromosome, right? On the end of that chromosome is a little piece of DNA called a telomere. And every time your cell divides, that gets shorter. And when it reaches a certain point, it says, \u201COops. I\u2019m old. Time to die.\u201D Well, stress makes that piece of DNA get shorter. So stress literally ages your stem cells. If you believe that\u2019s true, and it is, it also ought to be possible to reverse stress and make your cells younger. And lengthen the telomere? Have they done that? Have you seen that? There are some experiments underway looking at that right now, but there are ways to lengthen telomeres. I would also argue that \u2014 and I have absolutely no data to support this, but this is one of those gut things that I\u2019ll be looking at over the next few years \u2014 that cancer is in some way \u2014 so what\u2019s cancer? Cancer is basically cells gone bad. It\u2019s cells that no longer know when to stop dividing. What\u2019s a stem cell? A stem cell\u2019s a cell that can self-renew, make a lot of itself and keep dividing, and become a lot of different things. What\u2019s a tumor cell? It\u2019s a cell that can make a lot of different cells and become a lot of different things. In some ways they\u2019re very similar, but a stem cell has the signals that know when to stop dividing. Tumor cells don\u2019t. I would argue that in some ways, cancer is nature\u2019s attempt to replenish that stem cell pool as we get older. That as we start running out of those cells, more and more cells have to divide to replenish that pool. And if something goes bad, then you get a tumor. Now, can I prove that yet? No. But we know that some cancers come from stem cells. We also know that metastases, the things that spread, are often stem cells. Talk to me about the experiment you did with Matthieu Ricard, who is a famous French philosopher Buddhist who\u2019s worked with the Dalai Lama. Right. And \u2026 Oh, and he\u2019s said to be the happiest man alive, I think. Yes. He\u2019s written a book called Happiness. Right. He\u2019s doing some studies with some people at the University of Wisconsin where \u2026 Oh, Richardson Davidson? Yes. He and a number of his colleagues meditate, and as they meditate they measure differences in their brainwaves. Right? And I basically said I would predict that those very same things that when you meditate and you have positive brainwave changes would also have an effect on your stem cells. He very graciously, and this is an N of one, let us measure cells in his blood before and after meditation. And what we found was a huge increase in the number of positive stem cells in blood. Largest increase I\u2019ve ever seen after 15 minutes of meditation. And so that meditation kicks in your body\u2019s own regenerative reparative powers? It\u2019s all about endogenous repair. And I don\u2019t think I said this earlier, but you know how when your son falls down, scrapes his knees, got a red spot? Yeah. That\u2019s inflammation. Inflammation, I think, is nature\u2019s cue to say, \u201CSend me cells.\u201D OK. \u201CI\u2019ve got an injury. Send me cells.\u201D And if you get the right cells there you turn off that inflammation and you heal. If you don\u2019t get the right cells there and you don\u2019t heal, you get more inflammation. And I think your body\u2019s saying, \u201CHey, I said send me cells. Will you get with it and send me cells?\u201D And if you don\u2019t get the right cells there, you ramp up inflammation and you start getting the negative consequences of inflammation. OK. Well, we see that on our skin when we fall down and scrape our knee or when we cut our finger or something, but that\u2019s going on inside our body all the time. We have inflammation. Every time you eat a cheeseburger, right? Every time you eat a cheeseburger. Yeah. We have inflammation going on inside our blood vessels, inside our organs, inside our tissues. And I think those are nature\u2019s cues to say, \u201CSend me cells.\u201D Well, I would also say that meditation is essentially doing that without the inflammation. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of sending those cells to the sites where you need them in a way to turn down the negative aspects of stress. So stress in my mind is another word for inflammation. I would say inflammation is the physiologic consequence of stress. Which also has mental and \u2014 it\u2019s also \u2026 Emotional, mental, spiritual, physical. Inflammation. We have all that too. Right. Yeah. If you don\u2019t believe stress ages someone, look at a president before and after they\u2019ve been in office for four years. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, on Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, faith, ethics, and ideas. Today \u2014 \u201CStem Cells: Untold Stories.\u201D We\u2019re meeting cardiac researcher Doris Taylor, who\u2019s made scientific history as she innovates a process that uses the given architecture of a heart, injected with stem cells, to bring the organs of dead animals back to life. Though this process is several years away from human testing and application, she hopes eventually to transform the field of human organ transplantation \u2014 using a patient\u2019s own stem cells to make the organ their own. Join our fieldtrip to her otherworldly laboratory at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Stem Cell Institute. That\u2019s at our new Web address, onbeing.org. Since my interview with Doris Taylor, there have been more intriguing medical innovations using stem cells. They\u2019ve been used to grow part of a human jawbone, and to repair corneas and restore almost normal vision to people who were blind from chemical burns. So, you know, I want to ask you some of the \u201Cso what\u201D questions. What all this means, or how you internalize it and make meaning of it. I mean, you have given life to something that was dead. Right? I mean, how does that make you think differently about what it means to be alive? Right. What it means to be human. I have to tell you that the most profound moment for me was when I \u2014 the first time I saw heart cells beating in a dish, just in a dish. You see these cells and they\u2019re beating and you go, \u201CWow. What?\u201D We get it that our cells grow and I always knew they were alive, but once you see those cells beating in a dish it\u2019s like, \u201CWow. What is alive?\u201D And I can\u2019t tell you I\u2019ve fully wrapped my brain around that yet. I can also tell you that, you know, I probably have to just think about this very simply, which is, we\u2019re able to put together these tools that nature\u2019s created and they, in ways we\u2019ll never understand, know how to become greater than the sum of the parts. And if you think about it, we\u2019re just really the hands that are \u2026 You mean \u201Cwe,\u201D the doctors, the scientists? Yeah. We\u2019re just really the hands that \u2014 we still haven\u2019t created a cell. I\u2019ve said for 20 years that if we really wanted to understand a cell, we should just take a big white wall, draw a circle on it, and everyone who walks by should write down what they know. And at some point maybe we\u2019d get to the point that we understand even what a cell is. We don\u2019t really know how it works. And the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful part is we don\u2019t have to. OK. We could spend the next 20, 30, 40 years trying to understand how this works, or we can watch it work and understand it well enough to make it safe and effective and maybe actually change somebody\u2019s life. And that\u2019s what we really want to do. We have a couple of questions that we ask ourselves. One: Is it ready for primetime? Would you want to use it on your mom? Is that the test: would you want to use it on your mom? If you wouldn\u2019t use it on your mom we\u2019re not going to use it on somebody else\u2019s mom. And then there\u2019s actually this great road sign from New Zealand, I believe, that somebody sent me from the Internet. And it\u2019s a road sign, and you\u2019re coming into a town and it says: \u201CDrive carefully. We have two cemeteries and no hospital.\u201D And that\u2019s really how we have to approach this field. Drive carefully. Drive carefully. And yet we\u2019ve got to keep driving because it matters. It matters. And we can already do things that 10 years ago we thought were absolutely undoable. Let me \u2014 I wonder if you\u2019ve read William Saletan. He\u2019s written in Slate. No. He wrote a piece after President Obama lifted the ban on federal funding of stem cell research using human embryos, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s against this, per se, but he wrote, \u201CYou won.\u201D He\u2019s talking to people who were for that federal funding. He said, \u201CNow, for the next challenge: don\u2019t lose your soul.\u201D I just, I want to read \u2014 so, again, you know, because all these things you describe are incredible. As you say, they\u2019re science fiction now or that\u2019s what it feels like you\u2019re working in. And he said something like, \u201CEmbryos are the beginnings of people. They are not parts of the people. They are the whole thing, in very early form. Harvesting them, whether for research or medicine, is different from harvesting other kinds of cells.\u201D And then here\u2019s the question, and I just want to ask you if this is even a way you would think the question can be phrased: \u201CHow far should we strip-mine humanity in order to save it?\u201D What\u2019s your reaction to that question? My reaction to that question is the ways that I\u2019ve seen humanity strip-mined have nothing to do with cells. In my spiritual world, it would be inhumane to turn my back on a parent who calls me and says, \u201CMy child was born with X, Y, and Z. Can you help me?\u201D And I\u2019m a spiritual person. The universe has given me tools; I\u2019m going to use those tools. At the same time, it would be morally wrong not for me to respect beliefs of someone else who makes a different choice. And that\u2019s really \u2014 you know, we\u2019re a diverse group of people and if you believe in God then you believe God, Allah, whoever, made us that way. And I can\u2019t judge what somebody else asks. I can only say in my heart it would be a worse travesty to turn my back on the knowledge and awareness I\u2019ve been given. Strip-mining humanity? I would say go spend a week in an intensive care \u2014 pediatric intensive care unit. Or go spend a week with kids who are struggling to learn how to sit up at age 14. Or go spend an hour with somebody who just wants to see their daughter or son grow up. And then talk to me about what you think the right approaches are. It\u2019s not a difficult question for me. The difficult question for me is really more about making room for hate or disbelief or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s just so ironic to me because I grew up with a brother who has cerebral palsy, OK? Right. Right. Right. So every year we used to go collect money for the cerebral palsy telethon that they had on TV. And they gave away a bike, so we had completely nothing altruistic about our interest. We wanted to win the bike. Right. Every year. You know, so we\u2019d go collect money. And there was this one lady who would give us, like, $50 every year, and so we\u2019d go knock on her door. And then there\u2019d be people who\u2019d just slam their door in our face. And our mom said to us, \u201CYou know, Doris, people usually don\u2019t care about things until it touches their lives. And once it touches their lives their perception changes.\u201D And I can\u2019t tell you the number of people who don\u2019t believe in research or don\u2019t believe in science or don\u2019t believe in innovative approaches to medicine until it\u2019s their daughter or son or brother. And then all of a sudden, they\u2019re at least open to the conversation. I always go back to a very simple account that we used to chew willow bark hundreds of years ago for pain, right? And we had no idea that it was really \u2014 that it contained the same thing that is in aspirin today. But our grandmothers knew and our grandmothers\u2019 mothers knew and it\u2019s the same sort of thing. There are so many ways that we know we can heal ourselves and there\u2019s a body of knowledge out there about that. And we\u2019re really just discovering details. How does that work? Mm-hmm. Not \u201CDoes that work?\u201D but \u201CHow does that work?\u201D I would also say that you have to dream it and think it and speak it before you can do it. But it\u2019s a great combination you\u2019re talking about, of applying the best of your knowledge, speaking your dreams and questions, and also relying on common sense and your intuition. Sure. But isn\u2019t it all the same thing? I mean, really. Ten, 20 years ago, if we had said we were going to map the human genome \u2014 20 years ago, when we did say we were going to map the human genome \u2014 it was viewed as almost impossible. It was going to take forever, and we would be able to do it for one genome and that would be it. Right. Well, it\u2019s no longer impossible. Fifty years ago, computers filled up this room. Right. t\u2019s all the same story. It\u2019s just we\u2019re talking about our bodies and we find that much more mysterious. And we find it much more mysterious because they are alive, and they are \u2014 and we don\u2019t know how to capture that essence. And yet we\u2019re getting to the point that we at least have readouts for it, and cells are one readout. You know, there are a lot of studies that have been done on music, imagery, touch, prayer, as intercessions for illness or disease. Right. If you believe those work, how do they have to work? They have to work at the level of the cell. And that\u2019s where you work. And they probably work in part by increasing the number of stem cells. Right. My vision of the future is if it exists, it exists at the level of the cell. We can measure it, we can use it. We can use cells to very early in the process to prevent and reverse disease, after a disease has happened to begin to treat disease, and when all else fails, I really do think we can build tissues and organs and begin to cure disease. And aging and chronic disease are really, in my mind, the same thing. Doris Taylor is the director of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair at the University of Minnesota. The fascinating science of stem cell research comes with a world of complex moral questions and uncertainties. Beyond the very important questions about when life begins and the moral status of the human embryo, people across religious and political divides care about how stem cell techniques will be commercialized and who will have access to them. We hope this conversation with Doris Taylor might broaden existing conversations and inform fresh thinking on the moral and ethical questions her science touches. Let us hear your thoughts \u2014 either as they\u2019ve been sparked in listening to Doris Taylor or through your own experiences and knowledge. Look for the \u201CShare Your Story\u201D link on our home page, onbeing.org. And find much more material there to expand and share the conversation that has begun here \u2014 including the unedited interview and our fascinating tour of her lab. And as you know if you\u2019ve ever visited our website, it contains a universe of subjects and ideas. Right now, for example, we invite you to learn about the Fes Festival.
