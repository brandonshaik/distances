  "fullText": "I think that the conversation does have to be about how important people are to each other and how vivid that becomes after a suicide. We\u2019re all suddenly reaching out to each other to say, \u201CReally? Did this really happen?\u201D and \u201CI miss this person,\u201D and \u201CI didn\u2019t even know that I was so connected to them.\u201D And that\u2019s a good place to start a conversation. Not the negative side. Not to say, \u201CDon\u2019t kill yourself \u2018cause it would kill other people,\u201D but to say, \u201CLook how involved we all are just under the surface, and let\u2019s try to help each other.\u201D \u201CStay.\u201D That\u2019s the message that philosopher, poet, and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht puts at the center of her unusual writing about suicide. She\u2019s traced how the history of Western civilization has at times demonized those who commit suicide, at times celebrated it as a moral freedom. She has struggled with suicidal places in her life and lost friends to it. As a scholar, she\u2019s now proposing a new cultural reckoning with suicide, based not on morality or on rights, but on our essential need for each other. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with Jennifer Michael Hecht in 2014, after she published Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It. And I also interviewed her once before, in the early years of this show, about her glowing work on the forgotten history of doubt as a graceful life philosophy. I can\u2019t remember if I asked you this when I talked to you before. This has just become a stock question for me. I ask everybody this question to begin, which is, was there a spiritual, a religious background to your childhood? Yes, there was. My father was a Jewish atheist physicist. Still is. That\u2019s a great tradition. That\u2019s a great lineage to me. Yes, it really is. And, my mom believed in Judaism and the Jewish God, and she was in charge of our spirituality, until, at ten, I decided, no this is not true. OK. But I did all the stuff before that. I went to temple more than your average bear. I wonder, as you got into the subject of suicide, are there early associations for you with suicide, or anything that even just came to you as you were writing this book? Well, yeah. I\u2019ve lived with suicidal thoughts at times. So it\u2019s all very keen to me. Hm. I don\u2019t think you really \u2014 you don\u2019t really talk about that in the book, do you? Not in the book, but I talk about \u2014 in the preface, I talk about my own dark times. Yeah. And now, in discussing with people afterwards, it just seemed more relevant to talk about my own. And then it seems like you really became mobilized to pick this up and worry with it, and think about it, and think about it historically. After, not just one, but two peers\u2026 Yeah, about a year apart. \u2026young women\u2026 Yeah. \u2026fellow poets and friends, killed themselves in a short period of time. That\u2019s right. We had all been up at Columbia getting our PhDs at the same time, them in literature, and I in history of science. But we were all poets. So we knew each other then, and to varying degrees saw each other across the ten or whatever years that followed, just because we were poets, go to the conferences and stuff, and parties, and see each other everywhere. But when the first friend did it, I had just started to come out of a very dark period myself. And then when the second friend did it, who was also friends with the first \u2026 Was that Rachel? Yeah. Mm-hmm. And \u2014 Rachel Wetzsteon. And, yeah, I wrote something on the internet, not thinking I was really talking to more than a few other poets. But, yeah, it got around, too, and that\u2019s when I started to think very seriously, because I was getting emails from people who were saying that these very little things I\u2019d done had helped them tremendously. And so it was really \u2014 then it was a mission. I\u2019m a historian and I read a great deal of philosophy through history, so I had these impulses of ideas, but I really had to search them down and find out the nuances and that did bring more information. But I also want to add \u2014 look, I\u2019m someone who speaks to people about living a deep, meaningful life without a definite spiritual guideline, and that made me very attentive to this. When I was feeling at my worst, I very much appreciated reading Mary Karr\u2019s Lit. She starts out \u2014 she\u2019s an atheist, she\u2019s an alcoholic, she\u2019s depressed, very depressed. And eventually A.A. convinces her to get the higher power, and then her son becomes interested in Catholicism, and she\u2019s a Catholic by the end. And that wasn\u2019t helping me at all. And so I was really thinking, what can a person do when they\u2019re at their absolute wits\u2019 end, but they can\u2019t fall down on their knees and pray? It doesn\u2019t work for them. For them, it\u2019s like talking to your hand. It just isn\u2019t helpful. Yeah, and you say that, and \u2014 interestingly, what you have been doing in your reflection on this is actually pulling the lens back to think about the human and humane context of suicide\u2026 Yes. \u2026which is life, which is a commitment to life. Yes, and also very specifically to other human beings. Right. It\u2019s a communal grounding for an argument against suicide \u2013 just, essentially, that we need each other. Yeah, the communitarian is what struck me first. And that was very much \u2014 I was sitting alone in my room, thinking this out. And when Rachel did it, too, I felt so much pain, even though we were not super close, that I was thinking in terms of how much you hurt other people when you do this. And so I shouldn\u2019t do it. And within seconds, I was on the other side of that \u2014 seeing that we\u2019re trained and raised to feel very individualistic, but it\u2019s not true. Right? Yeah. Right. We gain and lose weight together, we smoke and stop together, we have a third child together. We\u2019re really in each other\u2019s worlds. And you point out, as you do so well with your large sense of history and philosophy, that the history of Western religion and philosophy is among many other things, one long dialogue on the propriety of taking your own life. I mean, I find this so helpful in your book, how you look at how we as human beings, as a species, and as a culture, have been grappling with this \u2014 and the kind of drama. There\u2019s a trajectory there, right? There\u2019s a\u2026 Yes. \u2026there\u2019s a back and forth, and a development. Yeah. So let\u2019s, I mean, let\u2019s talk about that. Tell some of that story. Well, let\u2019s do a real quick, simple version, which is that the ancient world had a certain amount of ambivalence about suicide. They lauded some famous suicides, but their literature \u2014 Socrates said don\u2019t do it, Plato said don\u2019t do it, all for community. Aristotle said don\u2019t do it. And Seneca and Socrates are both thought of as famous suicides. Right. I was going to say Socrates said don\u2019t do it, but he did it. But he did it. But they were compelled by government. So it was in that very room where he was about to drink the hemlock that he told his people, you can\u2019t. Everyone has to stay for each other, unless you\u2019re compelled in the way I am. But Seneca also was \u2014 he killed himself when Nero, the emperor Nero, commanded him to. So it\u2019s not really what we today would think of as suicide. But Seneca wrote beautifully against suicide. He said at one point that life is really hard. And he talked about it in really interesting ways. But then there\u2019s another passage where he says he\u2019d like to kill himself, but instead of being courage from him, it would take away courage from his aging father. And so, he says, \u201CSometimes, to live is an act of courage.\u201D And that\u2019s been quoted many times, that last little line. And what\u2019s important is to note that the ancient world could, in certain sacrifice-for-the-community cases, they could appreciate this kind of gesture. But many scholars have seen Jesus as a suicide. It says in John \u2014 \u201CNo one takes my life,\u201D Jesus says. \u201CNo one takes my life, I lay it down myself.\u201D And \u2026 We see that in that same sphere of a willing sacrifice on behalf of something greater. Yes. And you add to it the martyrs. The martyrs problem was huge. And then once Constantine makes Christianity no longer illegal in 313, there\u2019s no point in it anymore for the church. The church is just getting to be more than a bunch of scattered little groups. But the church doesn\u2019t want to lose members anymore, and it\u2019s not illegal, so it doesn\u2019t make any sense any more. But people kept doing it. It was part of that culture. And by now, of course, they\u2019re doing it mostly by themselves. They\u2019re killing themselves to be a martyr for this religion. And the church starts having, at almost every council they have in the 300s, 400s, 500s, 600s, all these councils add notions of, if you kill yourself and say it\u2019s piety, you\u2019re going to be excommunicated. It was preventative. It was. And we have records that make that clear, of people discussing their thinking. And very often, also, discussing the tug between God and the devil. And the devil was, by the late Middle Ages, very much associated with suicide. And I think the point you make, I mean, what you\u2019re saying is provocative. I think what came down, then, into the Christian West eventually was not these kinds of displays of punishment, but a sense that this is wrong, that God forbids it. And I think another provocative point you make is that that as the only reason not to commit suicide was actually kind of dehumanizing. That it \u2026 Sure. Right? But\u2026 In your view? \u2026what\u2019s important \u2014 well, there are lots of ways of looking at it, but the key bit for me is that the Enlightenment saw it as a clear goal to stop the church being involved in this\u2026 Right. \u2026and stop \u2014 and to argue against that God was so concerned with your particular details, and what you did, and also just saying the church doesn\u2019t have any business in this. And then in reaction, Enlightenment ends up kind of christening it as a form of moral freedom. That\u2019s right. And saying it\u2019s sort of one of the key pillars of our autonomy. Right. That we have the right to end all this. And it really just kind of spread. And we think of it as the whole secular world holding these views, but we also think of Camus as being a figure\u2026 Yes. \u2026in that, but when you actually go back and read The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus definitely starts the thing with, \u201CThere\u2019s only one philosophical question and that\u2019s suicide.\u201D But that invitation is very misleading, because he goes through the whole book arguing against suicide. Right. He said life is absurd, there\u2019s no outer reason that you have to, but that suicide is the wrong step. That life is worth living, this absurd, strange thing should be witnessed, and it\u2019s vital that you, essentially, have some respect for your future self, who\u2019s going to know things you don\u2019t know. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with philosopher and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht. I have to say that this Camus example that you gave is very striking. I mean, I\u2019m one of, I think, many people who, in my 20s somewhere, or when this was assigned to me in college, read that first line of The Myth of Sisyphus. \u201CThere is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question.\u201D But I don\u2019t think that I either got to the end or really took in\u2026 Right. \u2026what you\u2019re saying was really that the whole sweep of his argument. Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. I interviewed Brian Greene recently, and he brought up Camus and The Myth of Sisyphus. And here is a brilliant person, but I think the way he internalized that is the way most of us internalized it. Though I will say that when I give talks, the only consistent book that people come up to me and say, this helped me, is Camus\u2019 Myth of Sisyphus. Really? So, if they read it\u2026 If they read it. \u2026it helps them save their lives. They tell me over and over. It\u2019s remarkable. Interesting. The idea that life is horrible, but absurd, and that we can embrace the weird side, and stop trying to make everything right and reasonable, stop trying to dot all the i\u2019s or make it seem fair, but embrace the absurd, and be interested in the future, and imagine Sisyphus happy \u2014 that\u2019s what they get when they really read it. So, I want to come back to this \u2014 let\u2019s just say, now, 21st century, there\u2019s an aura of, or at least a possibility of nobility, even kind of romance in a dark way. There\u2019s a noble lineage, also, if nothing else, right? Right? I mean, it\u2019s\u2026 Correct. \u2026Socrates, it\u2019s Sylvia Plath, it\u2019s Virginia Woolf, it\u2019s Ernest Hemingway, it\u2019s Goethe\u2019s Young Werther, it\u2019s Marilyn Monroe, David Foster Wallace\u2026 I guess, but I have difficulties with all of those. I mean, Sylvia Plath\u2019s son, who was in the other room when she did it\u2026 Right. \u202640 years later, kills himself. But I learned that first from you. I didn\u2019t know that. And it\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything \u2014 there\u2019s not\u2026 The poetry world knew. The thing about the Sylvia Plath example, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a happy thing. It\u2019s not like you look at that and say how romantic, but this list of people I just read, and the list is much longer, it\u2019s amazing, brilliant lives. Right? Yeah, but it\u2019s also \u2014 you\u2019re absolutely right that there\u2019s a way of thinking of this as sort of grand. But let\u2019s also point out that a great many people who kill themselves speak about their being a burden. They\u2019re afraid they\u2019re a burden on other people. Yeah. Because they\u2019ve been depressed a while, or because they\u2019ve just had a humiliating blow, and they think very poorly of themselves at the moment. Break up of a relationship, trouble at work, but people have to know clearly, and in a simple sentence, your suicide will be a much greater burden \u2014 exponentially greater. I think what this gets at is \u2014 and this really was with me as I was getting ready to talk to you \u2014 an aspect of suicide as a human phenomenon that we don\u2019t actually go into, which is the effect it has on those who are left behind. Yeah. Right? And importantly, not just family and friends who get hit very hard, but don\u2019t always repeat it, but in that slightly wider area. Again, I\u2019ve gotten letters, actual physical letters, telling me that someone at quite a distance made it \u2014 they became a little obsessed with it. So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever talked about this in an interview before. When I was in my 20s, I had someone I cared about commit suicide. And it was actually somebody I had been very close to, as well as someone who I had very much looked up to, professionally. I mean, at the point at which he died, we were living in different countries. But, how dislocating. It wasn\u2019t just a grief. It was \u2014 it\u2019s not just another \u2014 it\u2019s not just a loss or a death. The stages \u2026 Yeah. First of all, a total disbelief. That\u2019s right. Like, I really thought people were lying. Right? I mean, I really \u2014 first, I thought, this is some ridiculous joke, or some kind of \u2014 somebody\u2019s making this up. And then the guilt. And my understanding is that this is true, and as you say, not just in those immediate circles, of course in those immediate circles. But looking back through the last phone call that we\u2019d had. Yeah. Oh, yeah, did a lot of that. And how I had been \u2026 Fetishized the last email. And I had been dismissive \u2014 yeah. And then later, thinking \u2014 really torturing myself. Could I have made a difference in that phone call? And then the thing that comes that I don\u2019t think people know how to talk about, certainly the closest loved ones \u2014 the anger. Mm-hmm. Right? Because this\u2026 Oh, yeah. \u2026sense of the selfishness of it, right? I\u2019ve seen that response a lot. Of damage. Yeah. And, then the guilt over the anger. That\u2019s right. Sure. And this is just me in one of these circles, outside the middle. So I wonder if this is something you get in opening up the subject and the way you\u2019re doing it\u2026 Yeah. \u2026which is this communal way that creates a space to talk about this. Yeah. Absolutely. And it\u2019s an extreme reaction, but lots of people die after a suicide. They come in groups. I talk to some people\u2026 Right. \u2026in the army, they said it comes in groups. Right. So, then that\u2019s really a very serious thing you are pointing out, which is absolutely documented in many ways, that one of the best predictors of suicide is knowing a suicide. Right. But don\u2019t ever forget the flip side, which is your staying alive means so much more than you really know, or that anyone is aware of at this moment. But we\u2019re in it together in this profound way, and you can take some strength from that. I think that\u2019s, for me, that\u2019s been very important. Just feel like, obviously we\u2019re not individuals. Wow, how could I have thought that we were on that kind of level? And it\u2019s funny, because my two arguments, that you owe it to other people and that you owe it to your future self, are both about looking at what the individual means. Because when you look at a person within a group, and all the trends we follow, the clothes, the car, the not-car, all these trends that we follow, you realize the extent to which we\u2019re enmeshed. And when you look at yourself and realize that you have fallen in and out of love with the same person, you have fought with friends thinking you\u2019ll never speak to them again, and then you love them again\u2026 Yeah, right. \u2026we have different moods that profoundly change our outlook, and it\u2019s not right to let your worst one murder all the others. And I know this is something you\u2019ve thought about, but you talked about your dark times. Right. It\u2019s hard. You say \u2014 this is your non-religious argument against suicide. I\u2019m just, in a way, paraphrasing what you just said. \u201CSo I want to say this and forgive me the strangeness of it.\u201D This was from that original article you wrote. \u201CDon\u2019t kill yourself. Life has always been almost too hard to bear for a lot of people, a lot of the time.\u201D But it\u2019s very hard to argue with depression. It is. But it is possible. It is possible. I think if the message you are sending yourself is \u201Cthis is not how I always feel,\u201D sometimes you just have to wait. And because even when you\u2019re terribly depressed, you\u2019re not actually, actively suicidal all that time. That comes and goes even in the worst. Yeah. And you just have to \u2014 it\u2019s a great idea to write yourself a note saying, \u201CI am happy right now despite previous depressions. Please do not do anything to inhibit this from happening again.\u201D And go read it when you\u2019re down. There it is in your handwriting. Someone actually wrote that to me when they were telling me how much Stay had helped them. They told me this little trick that they used, and I thought it was brilliant. Remind your mood that the other mood exists. Because depression\u2019s particularly \u2014 one of its definitions is that within depression you can\u2019t see that you\u2019ve ever not been depressed\u2026 Right. You can\u2019t see beyond it. \u2026or that you won\u2019t be depressed. Right. You can\u2019t see outside it. You can\u2019t imagine outside it. No, you can\u2019t. But if you put it in your head beforehand, it can help. I mean, look, we all sometimes feel a sort of fleeting homicidal thought, right, when someone is just being incredibly frustrating or ruining everything or whatever, and you just think, \u201CI wish they were gone\u201D? I\u2019ve never had that thought. You don\u2019t have to even think about it. Right? Because you know\u2026 Right, OK. Yeah. You know that murder is out of the question. And I think that with a little bit of thought, suicide can equally be out of the question. We have tons of stats that say people go to the Golden Gate Bridge, you can usually \u2026 What do they call that? A suicide magnet. It is. But if you go to a bridge that has the fence up, a suicide fence up, the people just go home. They don\u2019t go to another bridge. They usually survive it. We have actual stats on this. So what does that say to you? What does that \u2026 That it\u2019s impulsive. That it\u2019s tremendously impulsive. And that if you can get past the impulse, and if you can put a conceptual barrier in your head, that it can work in the same way that that chain link fence can. You just \u2014 you\u2019ve put up a barrier. You\u2019ve talked to yourself about this. And don\u2019t argue with yourself. Get in bed and feel terrible, or go get help, or, jeez, playing a video game sometimes takes my mind off misery. There\u2019s ways to get through the worst, and, really, when I\u2019m starting out, what I\u2019m starting out with is really just the idea of, yeah, sometimes life, for some of us, can be unbelievably painful. But don\u2019t do this one thing. Your well-being is important to other people and it\u2019s not \u2014 a lot of soldiers in the military, suicide crisis is terrible. Yeah. You know, they feel \u2026 What is that \u2014 is this right? That more military personnel are dying by suicide than dying in battle in these recent years? Yeah, in 2012, that was clear and shocked everybody. Yeah. Yeah, and they \u2014 well, you go on. Well, so here\u2019s one way you say this. \u201CNone of us\u201D \u2014 and this is very simple, but I find this a very striking statement \u2014 \u201CNone of us can truly know what we mean to other people, and none of us can know what our future self will experience.\u201D But I think that the specter of suicide, alongside the specter of military suicide, that\u2019s most present now, is teenage suicide. Mm-hmm. Right? And\u2026 Yeah. Colleges are \u2026 \u2026seems to be fueled also somehow by the internet. And that is a time when people are even more susceptible to this way we are, which you describe, which is being part of a group and being very influenced by those around us. But also it\u2019s a time of life when somebody can say this very reasonable thing, \u201CYou can\u2019t truly know what you mean to other people, and you can\u2019t know what your future self will experience,\u201D but that\u2019s a time of life\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026when you\u2019re inside this bubble that you can\u2019t see or imagine beyond. Yeah, exactly. But it\u2019s also true that they sometimes have experienced a suicide and feel shame and guilt, and the easiest way to get them to feel better is to notice that they do have some control over future such experiences by making sure not to start the cycle again. And they\u2019re a population that, in many cases, their lives are being sort of run from outside, either because they\u2019re in the army, or college, or high school. And so we really have to dedicate ourselves to looking sharp on this. It\u2019s not fair to have so much control over people\u2019s lives and finding them in this way. Right. I think that\u2019s the question. So what can we do? I mean, you\u2019re making this really communal plea, so how do you see that working its way out? What can I do other than offer these things which I\u2019ve found helpful, and things that people have most said back to me, that they find helpful. It\u2019s funny, sometimes people argue with me, a lot of times people argue with me, that suicide is a right. It\u2019s a right. And I say, is it right for a teenager to do this? No. Is it right for a parent of a young child to do it? No. So, who is this guy who doesn\u2019t have anybody who loves him a lot, or those people are perfectly fine with his decision and he\u2019s of sound mind, and he decides he wants \u2014 this is a very rare person. And, if we\u2019re going to say that this is a right over and over to people, what are we giving them the right to? It\u2019s not the right to free speech or the right to freedom of \u2014 this is the right to die when they\u2019re not in trouble. And I should have led with, if your physician and people in your family think that it might be time for you to go, that seems to me a different conversation. Yeah, you\u2019re not talking about end of life. No, no. You can listen again and share this conversation with Jennifer Michael Hecht through our website, onbeing.org. And we want to say here that if you are contemplating suicide, or if you\u2019re worried about someone who may be, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Help is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in conversation with the poet, philosopher, and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht. She\u2019s traced how the history of Western civilization has at times demonized those who commit suicide, at times celebrated it as a moral freedom. She has struggled with suicidal places in her life and lost friends to it. As a scholar, she\u2019s now proposing a new cultural reckoning with suicide, based not on morality or on rights, but on our essential need for each other. A non-religious person herself, she writes, \u201CWe are indebted to one another and the debt is a kind of faith \u2014 a beautiful, difficult, strange faith. We believe each other into being.\u201D One thing I kept thinking about when I was reading you is \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if this is completely related, but bear with me. Go ahead. Anthony Appiah is a philosopher at Princeton. Right. I cite him in the book. Oh, OK. And he\u2019s done a lot of work on how moral change happens, and it\u2019s often a reversal of something that is considered to be noble, which is interesting, right? Mm-hmm. It\u2019s like, how did foot binding end in China, how did slavery end as a fundament of the British Empire? How did dueling end as an honorable way for gentlemen to resolve disputes? And it seems to me that you\u2019re wanting to start a similar kind of moral deliberation about suicide. You\u2019re relieving it from the way this was discussed morally in previous generations. But you\u2019re saying that not only should it not be imagined as noble or romantic in any way, or thinkable, really. But you\u2019re actually saying we need to make suicide resistance part of our culture. And, I mean, this is somewhere you actually said that, \u201Cattach a sense of honor to perseverance.\u201D Exactly. Appiah is brilliant about honor and shame, and how all those three things that you mentioned, the Atlantic slave trade, dueling, and foot-binding, changed in a generation\u2026 Yeah. \u2026because the idea of how to be a good person changed. Right. And, yeah, how do we \u2014 the first thing we\u2019re going to do if we\u2019re going to change something that\u2019s a little barbaric in our culture is just notice it. You can\u2019t move too fast\u2026 Right, right. \u2026but you can start to notice that maybe this isn\u2019t kosher. When you\u2019re under 44, suicide is the third, sometimes, in some places in that age group, sometimes the second highest cause of death. So think about what we do in terms of trying to avoid heart disease, and cancer, and car accidents, and then think about what the average person who\u2019s not in suicidal trouble at the moment does to prepare against the possibility of getting depressed and thinking this way. Right. And for our children, and for our friends, this is an unbelievably high-level killer. Suicide\u2019s killing more college students than alcohol, just as of recently. Suicide is killing more adult people in the general population \u2014 not just adults, but in the general population, more than car accidents for the first time in quite a while. I don\u2019t know if in quite a while, but certainly in the last ten years, accidents were what killed us most. And now it\u2019s suicide. So I think what you said a minute ago is so important, that you start just by naming it. That\u2019s the first step. You don\u2019t start by solving the problem. You start by seeing the problem. That\u2019s right. And something I\u2019ve been watching that feels a little related to this is \u2014 and even in this context of these ideas of \u2014 Anthony Appiah, about how moral change happens. How we have had this cultural awakening to bullying. Yes. Which, in its way, was honorable in the sense that it\u2019s happened forever, and people just decided that\u2019s the way it is, and you have to buck up and take it. And it wasn\u2019t right, and it wasn\u2019t \u2014 and, in fact, there was a power to the people who were bullies, and there was a victim\u2026 Even some respect, yeah. \u2026that we accepted the victimization of the people who were unlucky enough to be bullied, and suddenly, we see this as absurd. Right. That\u2019s right. And it\u2019s among teens and younger people. Suicide is not strictly, but to some degree, in a kind of overlapping universe with that. It\u2019s a wonderful comparison. Especially when we remind ourselves that these bullying situations are entirely institutionally created, right? Yeah. We send these people to high school. We, as a culture, have designed it. We send them in, and so you say, \u201CYeah, we\u2019re sending our child to a torture chamber. Yeah, that\u2019s what we do.\u201D And, yeah, if people are being bullied to the point of misery, we have a responsibility to look at it. But you\u2019re absolutely right and it\u2019s a wonderful comparison. But let\u2019s talk about \u2014 there\u2019s a really substantial, positive \u2014 positive is not a big enough word. I even want to say there\u2019s kind of a \u2014 there\u2019s certainly a moral argument, there\u2019s a spiritual argument by some definition, that there\u2019s a way you\u2019re framing this. And you invoke Maimonides saying, \u201CHe who destroys himself destroys the world.\u201D You invoke Levinas, a French Talmudic scholar, that our acts of friendship are the most real and knowable aspect of the entire universe. The discussion you want to have is not so much against suicide, but for staying alive for each other. It\u2019s choosing life. Yeah. And, it\u2019s \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s choosing living. Yeah, choosing staying alive. Choosing staying alive. And, yes, I thought of myself as an individual before I started doing this thinking in a way that I no longer do and I feel better. It doesn\u2019t really mean you have to go out and do a lot of communal things, though all sorts of studies show that will help. Force yourself to go be with other people is a good start. But it\u2019s also just this internal thing where I notice more that I\u2019m part of this human thing, and that there\u2019s no such thing as wasted contributions. And so, it really is \u2014 it\u2019s a better feeling about what we are and what we\u2019re doing, and most people through history had it without trying because they lived in tiny communities that were besieged by either drought or flood or whatever, and they had to work together to do anything. And they were more aware of their connection to each other. And, nowadays, we\u2019re very \u2026 In a way, that connection was also just forced on them, right? It wasn\u2019t optional. It\u2019s optional for us. Right. Yeah. It\u2019s optional, and I suggest taking that option whenever you want. But just be more aware that we have all sorts of secret web-like connections to each other. And that sometimes when you can\u2019t see what\u2019s important about you, other people can. And even Augustine said you can\u2019t kill yourself because God said \u201Cthou shalt not kill,\u201D and that\u2019s it. Aquinas comes along much later in the 12th century, and says you can\u2019t kill yourself because of what you owe the community, because of what you owe yourself, and the God issue. But still, the God issue\u2019s the one that people use, because it was quite fierce. You didn\u2019t really have to think about it and argue about it. But these other things were on Thomas Aquinas\u2019s mind. I feel like you sound a little bit like Maimonides when you say, this is something you wrote. \u201CRejecting suicide is a huge act within a community. I also think it changes the universe.\u201D And you wrote, \u201CEither the universe is a cold, dead place with a little growth of sentient but atomized beings, each all by him or herself trying to generate meaning, or we are in a universe that is alive with a growth of sentient beings whose members have made a pact with each other to persevere.\u201D Yeah. That feels powerful to me. I feel like just the respect of the idea of love and meaning. Yeah, I\u2019m outside of the religious tradition, but though I do like rituals and I think if you can perform any of your childhood rituals without saying anything you don\u2019t believe anymore, you should definitely do it. It helps a life make sense. But I want to add that I personally don\u2019t believe every person is responsible for finding their own meaning, as so many secularists have said. I believe that the meaning is already in the culture, and in the community, and that sometimes you need to trust what other people are doing and trust that maybe \u2014 when you\u2019re a kid, the idea that maybe someday you won\u2019t need to be the king of the world and you\u2019ll be happy to have found someone to love and you\u2019ll be overjoyed to have some children and have a job that pays for your car. You don\u2019t know that when you\u2019re a kid. That\u2019s something that comes with growing up. You only later find out, \u201COh, they had something there.\u201D When you\u2019re a kid, you look at all the houses the same, and it crushes you. You so want to be special. But special doesn\u2019t turn out to be this huge requirement later on. People find other ways to \u2014 not find other ways \u2014 the chief ways to be happy are to have people you love, and meaningful work, and be loved back. It\u2019s what goes on. And you really can say to yourself, I need to see the bigger picture and be involved emotionally in the bigger picture. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with philosopher and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht. I think that also does get back to the fact that, especially in the time we\u2019re living in now, there are so few givens anymore about what you will be able to get. I mean, I think the new generations are, in many, probably very healthy ways, having to redefine what it\u2019s going to look like to have crafted a life of meaning. Yep. Right. And I suspect\u2026 Oh, yeah, I\u2019ve got a seven year old and a nine year old. It\u2019s hard to push them in any direction because I\u2019m no longer sure that a doctor or lawyer is the way \u2014 it\u2019s just the world\u2019s topsy turvy. Yeah. And I suspect that this complete shifting of the ground beneath our feet probably has something to do with the boomer suicide rate, as well. But I mean another thing that you\u2019re picking up for cultural examination in an interesting way, I think, is this idea that it\u2019s this reality base, that we learn and grow through pain, that\u2019s there\u2019s value in suffering and survival. Those are messages that have been carried forward by our religious traditions, to some extent, I suppose, in psychology, psychotherapy, but not \u2014 I\u2019d say our culture is \u2014 in many ways, sends the exact opposite message, right? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think it\u2019s key to think about gratitude, to feel gratitude to other people for trying, and to know that you have other people\u2019s gratitude. Indeed, let\u2019s start with me. I\u2019m grateful to you who is listening, who feels tempted to suicide. I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re sticking it out for the sake of other people. And I know many people are and, you\u2019re my hero. The idea that pain makes us grow and become more wise, we do not hear this, but it goes right through history. So many people have said, philosophers and artists and writers, and also leaders. People in major leadership roles often talk about a period of time where they were lost, and that they count that humbling experience as the reason that they can lead others. So, sometimes, we do have to go back to those arguments as secular people. Yeah, in this world, we\u2019re trying to kill pain wherever we can, and I applaud it. Right. Let\u2019s try. But it\u2019s not the way life goes. So, you\u2019ve made it clear that you\u2019re not talking about end-of-life situations. And I wonder what else \u2014 what other difficult area do you find this lands with people. I mean, are there people\u2026 Well, they don\u2019t think \u2026 \u2026do they think that this is the way \u2014 does this feel like a way of judging? Is it \u2026 Oh, yeah. Yeah. There\u2019s been a little of that. People saying that this blames the past suicides. I really feel like if you have never heard the argument, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to even think about that. And if you have heard the argument, you\u2019ve still got to find out about external circumstances. What do you mean the argument? You\u2019re\u2026 The idea through history that we will hurt each other tremendously if we do this, and that there are communal reasons to stay. And that \u2014 how can you say that there\u2019s a burden on the people who are already gone if we haven\u2019t had this conversation yet? Oh, OK. And I\u2019m not so much just saying mine, I\u2019m saying all these people in history that I\u2019ve been able to quote, because those arguments fell out of the culture with the turf war between religion and secularism. And we have to right \u2014 get that pendulum coming back a little bit, where we\u2019re not declaring our independence by killing ourselves. So, that certainly appears. It\u2019s not even as big as the people who think that you can\u2019t convince a suicidal person with ideas. And to them, I say, look at the suicide hotlines. They\u2019re everywhere. Do you think people would keep that up without checking that they help? Right. Look at the counseling, and the specific diagnostic checks that people do on all these different attempts to help people. And they help because talking helps, because ideas help, and we certainly can \u2014 I agree, that when a person is in their worst place, that\u2019s a hard time to hear anything new. But what about talking about it before it happens? Right. Tell me how having walked through these experiences and this research and writing the book, and also all the conversations you have in the wake of the book, how does this infuse your life now as a friend, colleague, and a parent? What do you think you do differently maybe that you didn\u2019t do before? Well, one little thing is I do impress upon my children that children don\u2019t have to be able to see their way out of a difficulty, they just have to report it, because grown-ups are \u2014 they have almost different brains. I try to backpedal that. I don\u2019t want to sound insulting, but I do want to say, if you can\u2019t think of a way out of it, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a way out of it. That\u2019s something that studying the brains of younger people definitely made me think I need to pass on. I see my kid in despair, and it\u2019s something that I can help fix, but they don\u2019t see it at all. Right. What about, let\u2019s say, if \u2014 your children are younger now, but let\u2019s say when they\u2019re a little older, if they had a friend who committed suicide. What have you learned, even through all your research, about what \u2014 how you would handle that? Well, look, it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s a scary thing. I think that the conversation does have to be about how important people are to each other and how vivid that becomes after a suicide. Mm-hmm. We\u2019re all suddenly reaching out to each other to say, \u201CReally? Did this really happen?\u201D And \u201CI miss this person,\u201D and \u201CI didn\u2019t even know that I was so connected to them.\u201D And that\u2019s a good place to start a conversation. Not the negative side. Not to say, \u201CDon\u2019t kill yourself \u2018cause it would kill other people,\u201D but to say, \u201CLook how involved we all are just under the surface, and let\u2019s try to help each other.\u201D That\u2019s wonderful. There\u2019s a line in your book that was very striking to me. Because I did interview you once before, a decade ago, after the Doubt book came out. And, here\u2019s what you say. \u201CWe are indebted to one another, and the debt is a kind of faith, a beautiful, difficult, strange faith. We believe each other into being.\u201D Yeah. We do believe each other into being. Imagine yourself alone on this planet. Would anything be the same? Would you wash a dish? Would you think about productivity? Would you think about when you slept? How would you conceive of what your life means? It\u2019s like a little kid left alone in a house, just sudden shock of existential distress. We make the meaning for each other. And the culture makes the meaning. And we have these friendships in our head of people who thought life was really terrible, and yet decided that there\u2019s this beauty in it, and this communalism. So, yeah, I certainly believe we believe each other into being. We\u2019re not much when we\u2019re not in the eyes of someone else at least some of the time. Jennifer Michael Hecht\u2019s books include Doubt: A History and Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It. She has also released several books of poetry, including Funny and Who Said. And here, in closing, are the final lines of her poem, \u201CNo Hemlock Rock.\u201D It alludes to the way Socrates committed suicide after being condemned in an Athenian trial by drinking poisoned Hemlock: Poison yourself, it poisons the well; shoot yourself, it cracks the bio-dome. I will give badges to everyone who\u2019s figured this out about suicide, and hence refused it. I am grateful. Stay. Thank you for staying. Please stay. You are my hero for staying. I know about it, and am grateful you stay. Eat a donut. Rhyme opus with lotus. Rope is bogus, psychosis. Stay. Hocus Pocus. Hocus Pocus. Dare not to kill yourself. I won\u2019t either. If you are contemplating suicide, or if you\u2019re worried about someone who might be, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. We\u2019ve also listed that number on our website, onbeing.org. There, you can also listen again or share this show, and you\u2019ll find the poem Jennifer Michael Hecht just read, as well as the original post that led her to write Stay. Also \u2014 we have a request for you this week. We\u2019d love ten minutes of your time to tell us how you listen to On Being, and how you take in or use what you hear. We have always grown by listening to our listeners, and this is your chance to participate in a survey that will help us shape our next chapter. Find the link on our homepage, at onbeing.org. And thank you."
