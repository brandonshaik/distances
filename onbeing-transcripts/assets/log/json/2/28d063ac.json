  "fullText": "Vigen Guroian is an Armenian Orthodox theologian who experiences Easter as a call to our senses. He is passionate about the meaning of grand ideas like incarnation, death, and eternity as revealed in life and in his garden. A professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, he also tends a large perennial and vegetable garden at his home in central Virginia. This hour, we take in the religious discoveries he makes there. Look, when I get into the garden in the spring, and I\u2019m getting ready for it here, it comes pretty early in central Virginia \u2014 what am I doing during Lent, in particular? I\u2019m digging out weeds that have died. I\u2019m cleaning out the garden. It\u2019s a messy business and it\u2019s not terribly pleasant. But in the task of very doing it, my senses are being brought alive. I\u2019m attuning my body. I\u2019m cleansing my soul. I\u2019m making myself ready to receive the gift. \u201CRestoring the Senses.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. Differences over calculating the date of Easter were among the disputes that led to the 11th-century schism between the ancient church centers of Constantinople and Rome. But there are many elemental differences between the Orthodox spiritual sensibility and that which spread throughout the West from Rome. The Romans built roads, one adage goes, while the Greeks built metaphysical systems. Eastern Orthodox theology is experiential, sacramental. Its liturgies engage all the senses with incense, icons, and lush hymnody. Ancient rituals are understood in themselves to convey biblical truths and transcendent realities. Vigen Guroian\u2019s Armenian Orthodox tradition is one of the most ancient traditions in this Orthodox realm of 300 million Christians in the world today. In common with many Western Christians, they observe the penitential season of Lent; and in the Holy Week preceding Easter, they commemorate the biblical events leading to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. But when I spoke with Vigen Guroian in 2007, he began to explain how his tradition also understands these events mystically. The Bible refers to Jesus ushering in a \u201Cnew creation.\u201D And Armenian Orthodox worship ritually places Easter in the great cosmic drama from the creation of the world to eternity and back again. In my own tradition, for example, the first Sunday would be in observance of the beginnings, creation. And in a sense, through the whole of Lent, you recapitulate the story of creation, fall, and redemption. These are circles inside of circles, repetitions inside of repetitions. For example, in the Armenian liturgical calendar, there is a kind of eight-day cycle. Eight-day cycle? Yes. Well, the eighth day is the day of the new creation. Every Sunday is not only the first day, but it\u2019s also the eighth day. We break out of the temporal week, seven days, and break into the new creation, which is on the eighth day, which is the day of the Resurrection. So \u2026 And what does that mean? I mean, is that a state of mind? It\u2019s a way you move through time differently? Absolutely. That\u2019s the way I move through time. So the beginning and the end are connected with one another. But it\u2019s not simply intellectual, it\u2019s, it\u2019s bodily. I mean, when we\u2019re, when we\u2019re within the liturgical service, it is happening. And that experience is going to form a way of seeing the world \u2026 Right. \u2026 and going through the world, which is \u2026 Walking back out into the world out of that sanctuary \u2026 Yes. \u2026 out of that liturgy. Yeah. And this is so foreign, right, to the way Christianity has infused American culture? It\u2019s a different way of being Christian. Oh, of course, of course it is. Well, for example, I\u2019m not particularly interested in conflating, correlating a reading of the Genesis account of creation with the latest scientific theory. I think of the first chapter of Genesis as a divine litany. Something is happening and then God says, as a respondent, he takes both the role of liturgist and respondent. He says, \u201CThis is good,\u201D or \u201CThis is beautiful.\u201D Actually, the Hebrew word tov could mean either \u201Cgood\u201D or \u201Cbeautiful.\u201D And the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, which was the Old Testament of the early church, translates it \u201Cbeautiful\u201D in the Greek, not \u201Cgood.\u201D So God saw what he had made, those passages, and \u2014 as the Jews had translated \u2026 And then God says, \u201CThis is beautiful.\u201D That\u2019s the response. Beautiful. Mm-hmm. So in a sense, God is singing creation into existence. I think C.S. Lewis caught this, had his own deep sense of this when he wrote The Magician\u2019s Nephew, in which Aslan, the great lion, the great god lion, sings the creation of Narnia, brings Narnia into existence in hymn, in song. It just seems to me that that way of understanding creation is different. Mm-hmm. Is different and, and simply would \u2026 It means that \u2014 that the song never ends. And words have been added to the song, but it\u2019s still the song. And think about throughout the Old Testament, from Genesis through the Prophets, the creation itself is, is really depicted as a great temple in which worship is to be done. God sets the foundations. God stretches the heavens as a canopy. And we\u2019re here to make the song of creation, the liturgy of creation, and new creation manifest, visible, audible in the world. I\u2019d like for you to talk to me about, you know, some of these huge ideas that, in fact, happen for you in worship. Well, if you begin to look at the Orthodox liturgies, the hymns and prayers correlate with the images that are in the church, the iconography that\u2019s in the church. And I must say that in my own tradition, the iconography can be rather sparse. We don\u2019t have an iconostasis in the Armenian Church, the way the Byzantines, the Greeks, the Russians, the Romanians, et cetera do, at the front of the altar. And translate that for someone who hasn\u2019t heard of iconostasis. In most of Orthodoxy, you would have a screen or a wall that stands in front of the altar, which is in the back of that screen. And you can see through, through a door. Sometimes, you can see through. It\u2019s partly transparent. It depends on the way this has been built. But you have an image of Christ. You\u2019re going to have to have an image of the Holy Mother of God, John the Baptist, an image of the saint whose name is given to this church. You\u2019re going to have to have other saints, even scenes from the Bible. We don\u2019t have a resurrection icon where Jesus is emerging from the tomb, sort of flying in the air because there\u2019s no description of that scripturally. What we have are two icons. One is the icon of Christ\u2019s descent into Hades or hell, bringing Adam and Eve and all of the saints out of Sheol, out of the realm of the dead, into the new heaven on Saturday. And we have an image of the empty tomb with the visitation of the women coming with the myrrh or the oil on Easter Sunday morning. Now, that\u2019s, if it\u2019s Easter, there is going to be a focus and attention upon those icons within the church. And they may be at the very front of the church, on the iconostasis, the screen or wall. Or they may be in other locations, in the ceiling, on the sides of this church. So talk to me about why, for you, those icons are important, what they do. Human beings are not simply oriented by one sense or two senses. They\u2019re, they\u2019re oriented by several senses. And so in order for the human being to be wholly engaged, all of those senses ought to be at work. One of the jobs of a Christian is to, in point of fact, hone the senses, reform the senses, make them holy. And that process can take place within a church, certainly, where everything is focused on God. So that the incense appeals to the sense of smell. The whole body is involved, the kneeling, the prostration on the ground, on the floor, the images that one sees, the songs that one hears. And that engages the whole human being. Well, that\u2019s consistent with the Christian belief in the bodily resurrection, the whole self, not just some disincarnate soul. Something I\u2019ve always been intrigued by, though, in my conversations with Orthodox Christians, is how this attunement to, to the senses is also very earthy, also has a very earthy side. It\u2019s not all just about gorgeous images in worship. And, you know, I just, I wanted to read this passage that you quoted in your book Incarnate Love, which, of course, is a central theme of the Easter story. And, you know, the example you used of talking about this is, is how it was articulated in, by Dostoevsky\u2019s Ivan Karamazov, right? Yes. And you wrote, he said: \u201CAlyosha, my boy, so I want to live and go on living even if it\u2019s contrary to the rules of logic, even if I do not believe in the divine order of things. The sticky young leaves emerging from their buds in the spring are dear to my heart, so is the blue sky, and so are some human beings, even though I often don\u2019t know why I like them. I\u2019ll get drunk on my own emotion. I love these sticky little leaves and the blue sky. That\u2019s what, you don\u2019t love those things with reason, with logic. You love them with your innards, with your belly.\u201D Yes. And of course, the irony, which is so often a device used by Dostoevsky, is that the principal atheist who\u2019s rebelling against God in the novel is articulating precisely what the Christian experience is or ought to be. So there\u2019s an irony there. And the question is, how much Ivan actually believes that. But, but yes. Absolutely. He is speaking a truth there. I believe he\u2019s also glossing a poem by Schiller there, the sticky little leaves. But unquestionably, there are several levels to that speech by Ivan. But, but one level, certainly, is Dostoevsky is presenting us with an image of religious experience, which is Orthodox \u2014 or Russian. He would say Russian. You would say Orthodox? Yes. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CRestoring the Senses.\u201D Vigen Guroian\u2019s books on theology and ethics include two volumes of spiritual reflection by way of gardening: The Fragrance of God and Inheriting Paradise. He points out that Eastern Orthodoxy never adopted the doctrinal emphasis of Western Christian theology. East and West have always given different interpretations to important facets of Christian thought, including the Easter story, just as the Bible itself contains varied metaphors for explaining the Easter events. One that has been especially dominant in Western Christianity is the notion that Christ paid the price for the original sin of Adam. Words like \u201Cransom\u201D and \u201Cdebt\u201D characterize what Vigen Guroian calls a \u201Clegalistic\u201D interpretation, focused heavily on the sacrificial aspect of the Crucifixion. Orthodox worship opens him to other possibilities as well. Now, in the East, there\u2019s less attempt to sort these metaphors out, particularly because the hymns dominate so much. And within hymn, within hymnography, within prayers, within poetry, you can get away with a variety of metaphors. In a point of fact, they enrich the poetry or the hymns. So I think that\u2019s one way of accounting for the fact that the Orthodox have not tried to separate out these metaphors. Well, anyway, there is a, a metaphor in the East, which I think is more at the center of the Orthodox understanding of what happens. That it\u2019s a physical interpretation. That Christ assumes our whole humanity, our whole human nature and restores it to a state in which it can grow into holiness without obstruction. And in fact, he makes it holy himself by the kind of life he lives and by the death that he dies, and his resurrection again after three days. The East does not regard Adam and Eve as perfect in the Garden. OK. But potentially perfect. And they can therefore grow into perfection as God has intended them to. So we\u2019re back to that potentiality. We have that potentiality, again, in Christ. We\u2019ve been healed. Our wounded body has been healed. Our senses have been restored to be in tune with and in harmony with God\u2019s purposes. I would like to talk about your garden, because it seems to me that in the writing you\u2019ve done about gardening \u2014 that is a place where many of these themes, if you will, become three-dimensional, you know, take on flesh. Yes. Yeah. It\u2019s my favorite writing. It\u2019s your favorite writing. Oh, of course, it is. And it\u2019s a beautiful writing. It\u2019s wonderful writing. Let\u2019s start talking about what you do in your garden, what you learn from your garden, the insights that come to you there that also, again, illustrate, and kind of bring down to Earth some of this theology. Oh, that\u2019s a whole \u2026 It\u2019s a huge question. Yeah. Where, you know, where would you start? Well, I would start by saying, and this, among some Christian communities, would not only sound strange, but perhaps heretical, but it certainly belongs to the imagination of the early church, and my own church, is that they are in a sense two scriptures. There is the written scripture, and that\u2019s at the very heart of the church. But there\u2019s also the imprint of God on his creation. And the fact that were not God constantly willing his creation, loving his creation into existence, it would disappear. In a real sense, creation is this: It is the will, the love, the imagination of God taking on existence and form. If God stops willing, God stops loving, we disappear, in my view. We\u2019re on that, we\u2019re on the head of a pin in that sense, and creation \u2014 the creative act of God, if you like, never, never ends. It is constant. We live inside of God\u2019s own eternity, though we count the days. And it seems to me that when you are in your garden, you, you feel yourself inside. Absolutely. Both eternity and, and, and temporal existence. It wasn\u2019t long ago that my \u2014 my son has recently gotten married to a young woman from Armenia. Remarkable. Here he is third, fourth generation \u2014 whatever you want to call it, marrying someone right from Armenia that, they met on armeniansingles.com or whatever it\u2019s called. Really? Yes, while she was here studying, and a two-year romance over \u2014 across oceans and great continents. But they were leaving one evening from our home in Culpeper, and we live still in the country, so that there aren\u2019t too many lights. And they looked up at the sky, and they live in Baltimore, right inside of Baltimore City. And she commented, \u201CMy word, you can see the stars. You can see the heavens, out here.\u201D And we\u2019re all just staring up at that canopy up there, you know? People don\u2019t look up anymore. They don\u2019t have time. They sit in cars, you can\u2019t see up. Right. Unless you have your top down. That\u2019s why I have a jeep, so I can do that at least nine months, seven or eight months out of the year. Taking in the whole of it, permitting one\u2019s self to exercise one\u2019s senses again. Right. Well, we drive on a highway. But, what is it? We\u2019re on a conveyer belt, and we\u2019re not allowed to see much either. It gets even worse now because they put up these walls so that the sound doesn\u2019t get from the highway to people\u2019s homes. So what do we see? I mean that might be a metaphor of a modern life. Well, certainly that second scripture I\u2019m talking about has been shut out from us. Though, we\u2019ve shut it out in ways that gardening opens up. I\u2019m grateful that I can garden. Now, in one of the pieces in The Fragrance of God, called the \u201CThe Temple Transparent,\u201D and I think I\u2019ve, I worked those metaphors up in just the way that I was explaining earlier on about the Old Testament, sort of presenting the whole creation as a temple that God has set up for us. Right, and that you really experienced it that way, your garden that way. I really experienced it. Mm-hmm. Walking down that path, which I call my Wordsworthian walk, down toward Hungry Run, the stream down at the bottom of my property, and just the bluest sky in December, and being able to see the trees reminding me of gothic, you know, the gothic arches. I felt as if I was in a great cathedral for a moment there. And, look, the images play in our minds and in our imaginations. If we don\u2019t have certain images, we\u2019re not going to see things that way. I mean if, if I wasn\u2019t reading the text, if I wasn\u2019t immersed in scripture as well, I wouldn\u2019t experience it that way. Nature and scripture interpret one another. OK. They are a diptych. Here\u2019s a reading from Vigen Guroian\u2019s book The Fragrance of God: \u201CIn spring, I cultivate the perennial bed with the magenta petals and sweet citrus fragrance of the rugosa rose in mind. In excitement, I wait also for the green bouquet of the broccoli plant and the calm, clean scent of the cucumber. \u201CThis was not always so. In the beginning, in my first garden in Richmond, Virginia, I farmed for food on the table. But in Charlottesville, Virginia, in Eldersburg and Reisterstown, Maryland, and last, here in Culpeper, the garden has finally reformed my disposition toward it. It has entirely transfigured my vision of life. \u201C\u2026 For the sake of beauty, I gladly leave the ruffled red cabbage to grow long beyond its time for harvest. I let the mustard reach high with bright yellow bouquets. I cultivate carefully the asparagus row not just for the taste of its buttery spears but also for the verdant fern foliage that shoots up after the spring cutting. I let volunteer sunflower, cosmos, and cleome seedlings grow where they choose. And I sneak orange nasturtiums into the hills of sweet-potato vines. \u201C\u2026 Gardening grows from our deep longing for salvation, so that beauty fills our lives.\u201D At onbeing.org, you can hear and read extended passages from The Fragrance of God and other writings by Vigen Guroian, including more on the spirituality of gardening.

Also, his understanding of why gardens can evoke large themes of life, history, and religion. If I remember the church, I also remember the gardens of my great-aunts and uncles, and of people I called uncle or aunt, they were Armenian, whose homes they visited. And in every case, they wanted to show you the garden. That was obligatory. The garden was a place where things came to life. It was, in point of fact, a reaffirmation of life and something to sustain faith, hope, and to go on living. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CRestoring the Senses: Gardening and an Orthodox Easter.\u201D My guest, Vigen Guroian, is describing his experience of Easter as a theologian and a gardener. He\u2019s Armenian Orthodox, one of the most ancient branches of the Eastern Orthodox traditions that include 300 million Christians worldwide. The Armenian people were persecuted and exiled under the Ottoman Empire. And during World War I, they became victims of what some call the first genocide of the 20th century. There is an intensity to Vigen Guroian that seems to come in part from his experience of his people\u2019s historic tragedy that he carries, as he says, in his bones. This mingles with the passion for beauty and transcendence that defines his life of faith. He\u2019s also been a gardener for most of his life. During the Lenten season of 2001, he moved from Maryland to five acres in Virginia, taking many of his perennials with him. Vigen Guroian has written that \u201Csmell, not sight, is the most mystical sense.\u201D Seeing is so easy. If I\u2019d seen the Resurrection or if I\u2019d seen this or if I\u2019d seen that, I\u2019d really believe, you know? We don\u2019t say if I\u2019d smelled it. Smell keeps the mystery. It reveals the mystery, but it doesn\u2019t fool us into thinking that we would believe in it or explain it if only we could smell it. And it comes to us with surprise, doesn\u2019t it? Now, I suppose my dogs wouldn\u2019t feel the same way. They probably wouldn\u2019t describe that as the most mystical sense. Maybe sight is \u2026 For them \u2026 But for us \u2026 \u2026 because they live more practically with their sense of smell, don\u2019t they? Yes, absolutely. So there it is. I mean, I\u2019m walking in my garden and all of a sudden, overnight, something has bloomed, maybe the honeysuckle, no maybe the rugosa roses or maybe it\u2019s just the cabbage in the vegetable garden. And it surprises me. And I don\u2019t even see it, but I know it\u2019s present. I feel its presence. No, I smell its presence. I\u2019m aware of it. Well, for many of us that\u2019s an experience like that of experiencing God in prayer. You know, you wrote in one place: \u201CMuch like the rose I sensed in the nursery, God is mysteriously present in our lives. Although I had forgotten the scent and the rose was out of view, its fragrance awakened me to its presence. We may not see God face to face or tangibly experience him in other ways, nonetheless, he avails himself to us as he did to Adam and Eve in the Garden.\u201D Mm-hmm. Yeah, Adam and Eve in the Gardens, their senses were fresh not adulterated. That\u2019s the way I read pre-fallen human existence, shall we say, is existence in the garden in paradise. And I think it is so interesting that you experience yourself there in your garden. I mean, this metaphor or this story of paradise and of \u2014 well, you know, you titled your first book about your garden Inheriting Paradise. Yes. But in your garden, that whole story becomes real to you. Yes. Well, look, when I get into the garden in the spring and I\u2019m getting ready for it \u2014 here it comes, this comes pretty early in central Virginia \u2014 well, what am I doing during Lent in particular? I\u2019m digging out weeds that have died; I\u2019m cleaning out the garden. It\u2019s a messy business and it\u2019s not terribly pleasant. But what is the reward for that, you know. The sacrifice is more than worth it. And in the process of doing this task, which one would rather avoid in certain days in particular when the weather isn\u2019t so great perhaps, and the task of very doing it, my senses are being brought alive. Right, right. And that means that I\u2019m tuning my body, I\u2019m cleansing my soul, I\u2019m making myself ready to receive the gift, and it may be in the first blossom of a peony, you know, what a wonderful flower. They don\u2019t last very long, but when they\u2019re there, they\u2019re something else. And they just pop up out of nowhere. Just this little bud and all of a sudden, it\u2019s huge, enormous, beautiful fragrance. You know, and when you write about the garden and again the beginning of the Christian story of Adam in the \u2014 which begins in a garden and even again thinking about Easter and Christ as the new Adam, I mean, I feel like that story is very present to you in your garden. And you often cite Armenian Apocryphal Adam Literaturethat also informs your thinking about that. I mean, that\u2019s quite intriguing. I\u2019d like for you to just tell me a little bit about that and how that also maybe shapes your religious understanding of what happens there. When we say apocryphal, we mean that it\u2019s \u2014 stories that really are in one sense interpreting and trying to imagine what more there was, say, that was going on \u2026 Right. \u2026 in the Garden or what happened when Adam and Eve were expelled and where to hence were they expelled and how do they feel about that. And those stories can be wonderful. They\u2019re wonderfully poetic and bring great feeling into one\u2019s experience of the scripture themselves. Here\u2019s a passage from Armenian Apocryphal Adam Literature as published in Vigen Guroian\u2019s The Fragrance of God: \u201CAfter Adam and Eve were beguiled by the serpent and ate the forbidden fruit of the Tree, God commanded his angels to remove them from the Garden and to guard the paths to it with a fiery sword. And so Adam and his wife were banished from the Garden and its light and abundant life and entered a place of darkness and gloom. They remained there in misery for six days without anything to eat and no shelter. They wept inconsolably over what they had lost and where they were sent. \u201CBut on the seventh day, God took pity on the couple. He sent an angel who removed them from the dark place and led them into this bright world. The messenger showed them trees from which they could eat and satisfy their hunger. And when Adam and Eve saw the light and felt the warmth of this world, they rejoiced with exceeding gladness saying, \u2018Even though this place cannot compare with the home we have lost and its light is not nearly as bright or its fruit half as sweet, nevertheless, we are no longer in the darkness and can go on living.\u2019 So they were cheerful.\u201D That kind of story reminds me, and is comforting, of the fact that I feel the same way in the garden, you know? That my garden isn\u2019t perfect either. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I labor here and I would like it to be paradise, but it\u2019s not. But maybe some of paradise is inside of my garden. My favorite of all the early church patristic writers was Ephrem the Syrian, who lived in the fourth century, who was \u2014 wrote mostly hymns \u2026 OK. \u2026 incredible hymns that are very much like this apocryphal literature. And it\u2019s so rich and so colorful and very unlike contemporary modern academic theology, which in my view is so dry and in many ways so impoverished because it\u2019s impoverished of metaphor. Is there a passage or are there some words of Ephrem the Syrian that come to mind? Well, for example, the notion that paradise is still there. We don\u2019t see it, but some of its fragrance wafts into my garden. He expresses it just that way. It\u2019s not entirely gone, paradise. It\u2019s \u2014 we experience it in this fallen world as well. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CRestoring the Senses: Gardening and an Orthodox Easter.\u201D In his book The Fragrance of God, Vigen Guroian describes the loss he experienced when he moved to rural Virginia, leaving behind the decade-old garden he\u2019d lovingly tended in Maryland. He writes, \u201CI realized that Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, whereas I willingly left my garden.\u201D And, \u201CI think that human beings have been leaving paradise and trying to grow it again ever since our first parents were sent off east of Eden.\u201D You know, it\u2019s kind of interesting to me when I hear, when I see you writing about the Fall. I do hear this theme coming through, I think in Jewish theology, there\u2019s not so much the Fall as the exile from the Garden. And I also hear that sense in you that experience in your garden. That\u2019s quite right. Exile, I mean, in terms of my own Armenian identity, obviously, it\u2019s a fact that so much of our Armenia is in diaspora. Yes. It has been in exile one century after another for one reason or another, but in modern life, certainly, that holds true. Mm-hmm. And it\u2019s probably working on me quite unconsciously. I mean, the first time I ever stepped foot in Armenia, it was next to a mystical experience. I arrived early, early in the morning as the sun was coming up. I had flown in from Moscow, and I felt as if I landed on a different planet. Maybe it was just the climate or something, but there was something else going on inside of me. I\u2019ve never had that \u2014 quite that experience again going back to Armenia. But that first time \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to make too much of it, collective memory or whatever it might be \u2014 but, yeah, it was like I returned home. I\u2019d never been there. How old were you when you first went back? Forty, about 40 years old. And as dramatically and poignantly as any group, I suppose, Armenian Orthodox Christians have lived these great themes of suffering and resurrection that are in the Easter story at this time of year. Well, certainly, in modern times, I mean, yes, but we can be too exclusive about claiming that for ourselves. But it, it, certainly, is true. I mean, look, I mean, there\u2019s no question that at least a million if not a million and a half Armenians died in a matter of a few years, around the time of the First World War. And that was half the Armenians in the world. That\u2019s incredible, you know, an enormous catastrophe. And it\u2019s had ramifications and reverberations into the fourth generation. It\u2019s a great wound. It\u2019s a great wound. It\u2019s a great wound. You grow up with it. It passed onto you. Right. And, OK. So here\u2019s what I want to ask you about, I mean, how that pushes at your theology, because as when we began talking, you spoke about how, you know, the resurrection is happening now. It happens in worship, it happens in liturgy. And in Orthodox liturgy, there is this sense that the church transfigures the world and yet, in Armenian experience that contrast between what happens in liturgy and what has happened in the world repeatedly is very stark. Yes, I suppose that is stark. Yeah. And I mean, so talk to me about that. Well, look, I mean, the human spirit is next to indomitable, in my view. And whatever that memory is of paradise that we have keeps us alive. I think Armenians are blessed with a kind of imagination that is so cosmic in a way. Is it not surprising that the ancient Hebrews produced the Psalms, you know, or the Song of Solomon, you know? I mean \u2026 These works of great beauty. These \u2026 Yes. And, and oftentimes, reflections of those who have suffered or been in exile themselves, enormous suffering and lengthy exile and removal from that place which is inside of them and which they wish to return to. So there\u2019s nothing highly exclusive about this. But I do think in the case of Armenians, they have a treasury of poetry, and really, the theology of my church is in its hymns. Those who would read those hymns that are not familiar with the tradition, would say, \u201CReally, is that a hymn?\u201D It\u2019s because it\u2019s so rich, not only in metaphor, but deep, theologically these hymns. And they can go on for a long time. And I, I want to press you because I think, you know, here is something you\u2019ve written as a theologian about the Easter events that, you know, that you see that history and nature are shot through with God\u2019s purpose and grace. Yes. Well, look \u2026 And how does, how does that, how can that be expressed? How can that be true in, within Armenian experience \u2026 Well, you can build a garden most anywhere. OK. I mean, you know, you go to the Middle East, not just Armenia. But certainly, in Armenia. You go even into Yerevan, in the back of these horrendous apartment houses, there\u2019ll be a little plot with a, and inevitably, you\u2019ll have a grape arbor, and you\u2019ll have some fruit trees. If I remember the church, I also remember the gardens of my great-aunts and uncles and of people I called uncle or aunt who weren\u2019t uncle or aunt, but they were Armenian that, whose homes they visited. And in every case, they wanted to show you the garden. I mean, that\u2019s, that was obligatory. You might go inside and be greeted. But then, you go right outside and go into the garden. And I can remember this over and over again. Now, why were they building these gardens? Was it just simply because they, they wanted fresh fruit? I, I don\u2019t think so, ultimately. But I was too young to ask those survivors \u2014 and these, many of these were the survivors of the genocide \u2014 why they were doing this? And what is your answer to that question now? I, you know, I have my suspicions. I think that they were, in part, bringing part of the old country over with them. There, there were memories of the garden that they had. I think that, also, that the garden was a place where things came to life, you know? It was in point of fact a reaffirmation of life and, and something to sustain faith, hope and to go on living. And is the answer to that question about how history and nature seem shot through with God\u2019s purpose and grace is that, that is constantly recreated in the midst of and despite and after these experiences of devastation. Well, remember the story I told about one particular priest who led his people out of the, the men out of the village, and they had no bread or wine, certainly. And so they were going to hold the Eucharistic commemoration, and they ate the dirt. I mean, from earth to earth, and he said, this cursed earth, but it is, you know, but it\u2019s blessed. That can be blessed. That curse can turn to a blessing. These men were being \u2014 probably going to die, either marched to death or shot. Right. But they were going to stop and do this with this priest. The resurrection is alive in the faith of those who are with us presently and have been in the past, which is to say that it\u2019s all very present. I found in the woods in Maryland a wildflower, the bloodroot flower. It blooms very early in the spring, around the time of Lent and Easter, depending on when Easter falls. I found a grove of these in a wooded area not far from my home in Reisterstown, Maryland. And I, and I transplanted them by an oak tree in a partially shaded part of my yard. And my experience of the first blooming, I really quite never forget. The reason why it\u2019s called the bloodroot is because the root itself, if you press it, you break it, you\u2019ll get a red dye that can be used as a dye. But the bloom itself only lasts a day. But it comes out of the sepulcher of the earth. And what it leaves is these heart-shaped leaves. And that is a microcosm of resurrection for me. I have a wild imagination. You know, I mean, I\u2019ve described the stakes in my vegetable garden in the wintertime as crosses on which bodies are draped, you know. I don\u2019t mean that in a gory sense. The geese in the sky remind me of the crosses that pilgrims have carved into ancient Christian sites. I think there are signs of the cross all over creation. How do you account for that? Well, clearly, we\u2019ve forgotten, we\u2019ve forgotten paradise, we forget God. And that\u2019s why I think we have scripture to remind us. OK. And, and you mean the scripture that is written down and the scripture in nature as you\u2019re describing it. Yes. Absolutely. As again, I think that we cannot do without one or the \u2014 look, we have to live somewhere, and that\u2019s the world that we live in, and the Creator has imprinted himself in so many ways into that world so that we do remember. And then, then the world, again, can be an epiphany for us. Vigen Guroian is Professor of Religious Studies in Orthodox Christianity at the University of Virginia. His books include The Fragrance of God and Inheriting Paradise. In closing, here\u2019s a passage from that work. \u201CSeveral summers ago, my children found two turtles and put them in the vegetable garden. During a thaw the next February, as I was digging up the soggy soil where the peas go, I lifted a heavy mound with my shovel, and then another. The two turtles had burrowed down for winter sleep, and I had rudely awakened them too soon. So I carried them to a corner of the garden where I would not disturb them and dug them in again. When my wife said that she feared the turtles might be dead, I said I did not think so (though I wasn\u2019t as sure as I sounded). I insisted that in spring, they would come up. And they did in Easter week. \u201CLilies and hyacinths signify the resurrection, and I can understand why. But I have a pair of turtles that plant themselves in my garden each fall like two gigantic seeds and rise on Easter with earthen crowns upon their humbled heads. With the women at the tomb, I marvel.\u201D As we were finishing this week\u2019s show, we heard from Vigen Guroian that he\u2019s just built a new grape arbor in his garden, with the help of some students. He says he is thrilled to be growing grapes again, after more than 20 years \u2014 this holds rich reminders of his childhood. And he notes that it\u2019s somehow appropriate that this was built in the season of Lent \u2014 which is still underway, as we go to air, for Eastern Orthodox Christians. He writes, \u201CWe gave physical expression in a most concrete way to what Lent is about \u2014 preparation for the fruit-bearing tree of life and the bunch of grapes that was pressed on it for our sake.\u201D Already, he says, his Concord grape vines are budding. Some of our richest exchanges are taking place now on our blog \u2014 where we do welcome your submissions. Norman Allen, a Washington, D.C.-based playwright, recently sent us a commentary called \u201CAt the Heart of Easter Sunday is a Woman.\u201D You can read that \u2014 and listen to him reading it \u2014 at onbeing.org.
