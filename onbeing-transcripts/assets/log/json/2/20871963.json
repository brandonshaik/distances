  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This hour, we explore the ethics of atheism with the Humanist chaplain of Harvard. Greg Epstein is an emerging leader in a movement he calls \u201Cthe New Humanism,\u201D and his story illuminates an aspect of U.S. culture that may be obscured by the \u201Cfaith debates.\u201D We\u2019ll also hear other voices of atheism and humanism from the past and the present. We are working so passionately, so many of us. I see this in the humanist and atheist and agnostic community, working just as hard as anyone else to build a world that is as good as it can be for ourselves and for our loved ones and for all of humanity, and for the sake of the natural world, too, that surrounds us and sustains us. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. In a recent, much-publicized Pew poll on the American religious landscape, 16 percent of Americans identified themselves as unaffiliated, atheist, agnostic, or, most prominently, nothing in particular. My guest this hour described himself that way until he discovered the tradition of humanism. Today he\u2019s the Humanist Chaplain of Harvard. Greg Epstein\u2019s story illuminates an aspect of U.S. culture that may be obscured by the \u201Cfaith debates.\u201D He is passionate about articulating an atheist identity that is not driven by a stance against religion, but by positive ethical beliefs and actions. We\u2019ll also explore other voices of atheism and humanism this hour from the past and the present. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, exploring \u201CA New Humanism.\u201D Harvard University has had an endowed Humanist Chaplaincy since 1974. And when Greg Epstein organized a 30th-anniversary conference in 2007, he gathered the likes of the novelist Salman Rushdie, the economist Amartya Sen, sociobiologist E.O. Wilson, experimental psychologist Steven Pinker, and the folk singer Dar Williams. This kind of gathering, like Greg Epstein\u2019s work in general, speaks to and for a constellation of identities as diverse, perhaps, as the world of religious denomination, among them the broad categories of humanist, atheist, agnostic, secularist, free-thinker, and bright. And unlike some of the Americans described in the Pew poll, Greg Epstein came to atheism not by disaffection but by inheritance. On one hand, I come from a great, very entrenched tradition because I am someone of Jewish background who happens to be an atheist and a humanist, and so was my mother. My mother was also of a Jewish background and an atheist and a humanist, and so was her father and most likely so was his father before him. Greg Epstein has been quoted widely in recent months as various commentators have explored the religiously unaffiliated demographic of U.S. culture and the new atheism represented by voices like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens. The Boston Globe has called Epstein a \u201Cministerial paradox,\u201D a member of that city\u2019s local clergy who quote, \u201Cdisavows God, preaches to atheists and agnostics, and seeks to build the equivalent of a church for nonbelievers and others skeptical of and alienated by religion.\u201D That is to say, Epstein, like other chaplains, marries and buries and performs baby-naming ceremonies. I wanted to know more about him and the world in which he\u2019s an emerging leader. Now 31 years old, Greg Epstein grew up in a crucible of urban diversity, and he was raised by two parents who in very different ways formed him at once as a spiritually curious yet nonreligious person. I grew up in a little area in New York City called Flushing, Queens, where we had people from every background. My friends came from every possible ethnic, religious, linguistic background. You know, we would go over to each other\u2019s houses on holidays and birthdays and we would be served different foods and our parents would be speaking different languages and they\u2019d be wearing different costumes on the holidays. And I absolutely loved this. And my mother was a refugee from Cuba. Oh. She had come over to this country \u2014 A Jewish refugee from Cuba. Yeah. Uh-huh. A Jewish refugee from Cuba fleeing from communism. Yeah. Fleeing from the idea that we all had to be \u2014 to have sort of sameness imposed upon us by an authoritarian government. And so she was a refugee from that, came here to this country at age 13 with nothing, and I think began to really profoundly question religion at that point because, you know, it didn\u2019t save her from this really very scary fate that she experienced. And she learned not from any church or synagogue but from the ethos of the \u201960s and the \u201970s and the hippies to sort of reinvent herself and to learn, even though she\u2019d had this very difficult childhood, to enjoy life, and to celebrate life, and to love music and the arts, and to love people. And this is what I was raised with. So my mother was this refugee from Cuba. My father was probably a refugee from the Bronx. I mean, he was born into this Eastern European Jewish family. You know, if you go back far enough on my father\u2019s side you\u2019ve got Hassidic rabbis in black hats. And then they come to New York City the way that so many, so many thousands of Jews and others did at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. And they\u2019re living there in enclaves, and they begin to move away from their traditions. Right. And so my father\u2019s family was quite secularized, and my father ended up studying and teaching Buddhism and meditation. And when my father died when I was 18 years old, what he left me as his inheritance were all of his books on religion. Our house, our little apartment, was surrounded by these books and so I would look around me and there would be Jewish mysticism on the one hand, Christian mysticism on the other hand, Muslim mysticism, Hindu, Buddhist. There would be the books on comparative religion and spirituality. And I would sort of look around, and I could see that this had been my father\u2019s passion all of his life until I was born. He was 41 when I was born. And I as a young person never saw him open any of these books. And it was \u2014 it was baffling to me. Why did he spend all of this time assembling all these books and never open them? Did you ever solve that mystery? Yeah, I did. I did, only after he died after talking to his friends and reading his things and sort of doing a little research on him. I learned that what it was is that my father, probably like me, had a very religious personality, but ultimately ended up with not a scintilla of religious belief \u2014 that he studied all these traditions, because he was fascinated by the world\u2019s peoples and by the different ways that we all try to discover a meaning in life. But the funny thing is that my father, as far as I can tell, in all the searching, never came across the word \u201Chumanism.\u201D Hmm. He never opened or found his way to a book about \u2014 on the subject of humanism. Knowing your father as you did, do you feel that if he had heard that word that he would have found what he\u2019d been looking for? That\u2019s it. That\u2019s exactly it, is that humanism to me, when I look at it academically, I see one of the most underappreciated and poorly known traditions in the history of intellectual communities and spiritual communities. It\u2019s something that almost nobody has heard of and yet it really ultimately is based on the values that so many people, people like my father, hold and have held. And so a lot of the work that I do now, you know, talking to people about humanism, even working with the media, is the sense that I really don\u2019t want other people to have to go through what my father went through, which is, that they\u2019re on a religious or spiritual quest their whole lives and they die without ever having heard of humanism. The term \u201Chumanism\u201D has its roots in the Renaissance, in that era\u2019s rediscovery of classical literature, poetry, and moral philosophy after the European Dark Ages. It was later used to emphasize the merits of a classical education, hence, the modern term \u201Cthe humanities.\u201D All of this derived from the Latin word humanitas, for which the Encyclopedia Britannica offers an eloquent and intriguing definition. Humanitas meant the development of human virtue in all its forms to the fullest extent. The term thus implied not only such qualities as are associated with the modern word \u201Chumanity\u201D \u2014 understanding, benevolence, compassion, and mercy \u2014 but also such more aggressive characteristics as fortitude, judgment, prudence, eloquence, and even love of honor. Beyond the Renaissance period this humanist impulse has been embraced by religious as well as nonreligious figures. It has spanned the Christian humanism of Erasmus, the pragmatist philosophy of Ferdinand Schiller, the humanist political realism of Niccol\u00F2 Machiavelli, and the Marxist humanism of a Jean Paul Sartre. On his way to what he\u2019s calling \u201Cthe new humanism of the modern era,\u201D my guest, Greg Epstein, sang in a rock band, studied Jewish theology, and dabbled in Buddhist meditation. For me, meditation is more about making music and it\u2019s about making art and it\u2019s about talking to people and helping other people. I get the feeling that some people say that they get it during meditation. I get that feeling when I\u2019m singing \u2014 Mm-hmm. \u2014 or when I\u2019m doing community service; I get this really wonderful feeling, I think. You know, it\u2019s funny, even Sam Harris, my colleague who\u2019s written about atheism, one of the things he does that I admire is he organizes a retreat for scientists where they do Buddhist meditation techniques. Right. He is a mediator, isn\u2019t he, Sam Harris? Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, I mean, you know, it\u2019s not my personal thing but I think that it can be helpful for people, you know, depending on how they do it and whether it\u2019s right for them. Mm-hmm. What I really wanted was a community. Right. But, I mean, what kind of community do you \u2014 can you have when you\u2019ve explored Buddhism and you don\u2019t like that, and you\u2019ve explored Judaism and you don\u2019t like that, and Christianity and Islam and rock music \u2014 there seems to be nothing left at that point for most people. And so a lot of us, I was one of them, just sort of say, \u2018Well, I guess I\u2019m nothing, then.\u2019 And luckily for me, that\u2019s the point at which I discovered humanism. And in what form did you discover it then? Well, at that point, you know, I had tried all these different things and I was so fascinated by it, by this idea of pursuing the most meaningful life possible, that I wanted a career in one of these fields. But given that I felt like there \u2014 there must not be any career that exists, I was getting ready to take the LSATs and go to law school, and at that point I ran across a young man who had been a teaching fellow of mine in a course on religion that I\u2019d love in college and he asked me, \u2018So what are you going to do with your life?\u2019 And that question at that point for me was like somebody had asked me, \u2018So what would you like for your last meal?\u2019 OK. And, you know, and I \u2014 It was an existential question, not a career question. Yeah. I mean, I just didn\u2019t want to even \u2014 like, \u2018Please, ask me anything but that.\u2019 Right. And so really didn\u2019t know what to say and so I turned around and I asked him, \u2018So what are you doing with your life?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m actually studying towards ordination as a humanist chaplain and rabbi.\u2019 And I had never heard of anything like that before, and I said, \u2018Really? Well, what\u2019s that?\u2019 And he said, well, he explained it a little bit to me but he said, \u2018The best thing I can do is invite you to come study with me.\u2019 And he did and I discovered the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, where I ultimately studied five years and was ordained after five very intense years. And I discovered the teacher who ended up becoming in many ways my greatest teacher, whose name was Rabbi Sherwin Wine. Yes. I\u2019ve seen some of what you\u2019ve written about him. Right. Was he also a humanist rabbi? That\u2019s right he \u2014 Sherwin Wine is someone who grew up in a Jewish community in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, and became a rabbi, knowing that he was an atheist, because he loved the idea of community. And he loved the idea of serving the community of his cultural background, which is Judaism. And back then there was no option to do that from a nonreligious or nontheistic perspective. And, actually, when he applied to rabbinical school back in the \u201950s, to the Hebrew Union College, which was and still is the largest rabbinical colleges in the United States, they said, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry. Probably half of our students are humanists. We just don\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\u2019 Mm-hmm. So, I mean, when you studied to be a secular rabbi, so at rabbinical school traditionally I\u2019m sure you would spend lots of time immersed in sacred text and, you know, tradition like the Talmud. I mean, were you studying all of those fundaments of Judaism as a religion? Well, we do study the sacred texts of Judaism, and of other religions, but primarily of Judaism, the Talmud, the Torah or the Hebrew Bible, et cetera, but we study them as literature. OK. And so, for example, the synagogue that Sherwin Wine created, that I was trained in \u2014 I\u2019ll give you a sense of it, there is sort of a decorated ornate Torah scroll as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen many times, but it\u2019s not located in the front of the congregation. It\u2019s put in the library, because it\u2019s literature. Oh, I see. And so we studied these texts as literature, and we also studied a great deal of Jewish history and other forms of Jewish literature. You know, the thing about it is that I don\u2019t in any way deny that the sacred literature of my own cultural people and of other peoples is important. I mean, the Bible is an important document, the Torah, the Talmud, the Bhagavad Gita, the different Buddhist scriptures, these are all important literary documents to me. However, one of the things that I do say is that I\u2019m more interested in many ways in modern literature. I mean, I think we give sometimes short shrift to the fact that it\u2019s modern people, people in the last hundred or 200 years that have been creating stories and poems and plays that give us so much insight into what it is to be a human being. And so we spend a lot of time in my studies studying modern literature, studying psychology. You know, we do a lot of psychology when we talk about how do you counsel someone in a situation where they\u2019re grieving or even when they\u2019re getting married? And you don\u2019t want to tell them at this point, you know, oh, you know, \u2018Your loved one is with God now,\u2019 or \u2018God is going to, you know, bless your marriage,\u2019 because you don\u2019t honestly believe this, I don\u2019t, and the people involved in these moments of their lives don\u2019t believe this, you know. So we try to be informed by psychology in these situations. I think, you know, one thing, though, that distinguishes sacred text of all kind is the fact that it has endured and meant so much to so many human beings \u2014 Hmm. \u2014 cumulatively across time. And, you know, I think of Talmud as kind of an ancient conversation that has continued across generations and there\u2019s, you know, there\u2019s gravitas and value in that, that you just \u2014 Yeah. \u2014 you can have, I mean, perhaps something has been written in the 20th century that will \u2014 that will endure like that but we can\u2019t, you know, we can\u2019t know it and there you have that deep tradition. Well, I mean, I very much enjoyed studying the Talmud, and I actually studied for a year in the Talmud Department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. And so for a young New York City kid like me who had grown up without speaking any Hebrew, I had to study the Aramaic Talmudic text, taking the classes in Hebrew. So you don\u2019t get to do that unless you appreciate the Talmud, and I do, but I value it because I can study it in the context of modern commentaries on it and of modern literature \u2014 anybody from an Arthur Miller to Yehuda Amichai, which is a great secular and humanist Israeli poet, I mean, I can read modern people. And that\u2019s what I love about ancient literature: that it informs my reading of the modern text. Harvard Humanist Chaplain Greg Epstein. At speakingoffaith.org view author Sam Harris\u2019s discussion with journalism students about his practice of meditation and his approach to changing consciousness. And here\u2019s a reading from the Israeli poet Greg Epstein mentioned, Yehuda Amichai. Amichai wrote in colloquial Hebrew and is credited with helping create modern Israeli poetry. When he died in 2000, the speaker of the Knesset eulogized him as \u201Cthe secular Israeli Jew closest to God.\u201D A man doesn\u2019t have time in his life / to have time for everything. / He doesn\u2019t have seasons enough to have / a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes / Was wrong about that. / A man needs to love and to hate at the same moment, / to laugh and cry with the same eyes, / with the same hands to throw stones and to gather them, / to make love in war and war in love. / And to hate and forgive and remember and forget, / to arrange and confuse, to eat and to digest / what history / takes years and years to do. / A man doesn\u2019t have time. / When he loses he seeks, when he finds / he forgets, when he forgets he loves, when he loves / he begins to forget. / And his soul is seasoned, his soul / is very professional. / Only his body remains forever / an amateur. It tries and it misses, / gets muddled, doesn\u2019t learn a thing, / drunk and blind in its pleasures / and its pains. / He will die as figs die in autumn, / Shriveled and full of himself and sweet, / the leaves growing dry on the ground, / the bare branches pointing to the place / where there\u2019s time for everything. \u201CA Man in His Life\u201D by Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, today exploring \u201CA New Humanism.\u201D So, you know, one thing that I have experienced in these years of conversation I\u2019ve been having mostly with religious people but not exclusively with religious people, I mean, I\u2019ve had plenty of people on the program, people who are not religious but doing work, often scientific work, that is very much at that intersection of scientific inquiry and great existential and philosophical questions. And, you know, one thing that I\u2019ve felt and also actually nonreligious people have said this to me, is that the terms that came out of the 20th century, you know, the word \u201Catheist\u201D in fact is as much a narrowing box as some religious labels felt. That it seems to imply that they have no spiritual life, that they have no sense of mystery in life. And, I mean, do you experience yourself to have something that defies perhaps a narrow imagination that\u2019s in our culture? Well, Krista, the most important thing that I can say about this issue is that I am in fact a believer, but I\u2019m not a believer in the traditional sense. Humanists, we don\u2019t believe in God. I\u2019m an atheist; that\u2019s what I don\u2019t believe in, and humanism is what I do believe in. Right. And it\u2019s simply that to me what\u2019s much more important is what I do believe in. And \u2014 Right. I guess what I\u2019m saying is you wouldn\u2019t define yourself in terms of what you don\u2019t believe in. Sure. No. But, I mean, I also \u2014 one thing, though, is that, you know, for some people, and I think one of the reasons why we run into problems around this subject is that for a long time in this country the word \u201Catheism\u201D has been treated as some kind of dirty word. Mm-hmm. And that, you know, it\u2019s really, to me, it\u2019s not morally acceptable that more people than any other group, you know, say that they wouldn\u2019t vote for an atheist \u2014 a qualified atheist who was running for president, that this is not morally good or acceptable that people say that. And I think that we need people of all sides of the religious, of all parts of the religious spectrum, to speak out against that and to say, \u2018Listen, you know, we in this country don\u2019t have religious tests for public office and we don\u2019t have religious tests for who\u2019s a good person.\u2019 And I\u2019m not interested in talking about this sort of old canard that you can\u2019t be good without God. That\u2019s an issue of prejudice if you feel that way. But what I am interested in talking about is what does it mean to be good without God? And that\u2019s \u2014 that to me is what humanism is all about. That\u2019s why I define myself primarily as a humanist. Right. And, you know, I have to say that that was a recent study and that surprises me as well, those numbers of people who say that they would least be likely to vote for someone who defined themselves as atheist. And I wonder, though, again, if it has to do with the fact that what atheism connotes is what one doesn\u2019t believe in and it tells, as a label, it doesn\u2019t tell someone else anything about what they do stand for. Well, I think that, that it\u2019s true that we as nonreligious people, whether we call ourselves atheists, agnostics, nonreligious, et cetera, need to do more to think about what we do stand for and to talk about what we do stand for. And I\u2019m very proud to be part of a movement of people that\u2019s doing that, and that\u2019s the humanist movement. Mm-hmm. And, I mean, this to me is a very exciting time for humanism, because people are asking us as humanists, \u2018What do you believe in?\u2019 And once we get the chance to explain that, I\u2019m very, very pleased with the feedback that we get from people in this country. But I would say this also. Part of the problem is that what God means, what this word God means and what belief in God means has changed over time. And so, you know, if you just look at what people believe in my part of the country, for example, because I know this part really well, you know, that the people who founded my university, that founded Harvard, were in many ways Protestant fundamentalists. I mean, and that view began to liberalize in this part of the country in the 1700s and the 1800s and, you know, now, because you have so much more cultural diversity in this country, so much religious diversity, saying you believe in God doesn\u2019t really mean much of anything without sort of saying more about what you mean by that. I mean, in many ways the word God has come for so many people to be kind of a general word for what\u2019s good. And we are working so passionately, so many of us, I see this in the humanist and atheist and agnostic community, we are so many of us working just as hard as anyone else to build a world that is as good as it can be for ourselves and for our loved ones and for all of humanity and for the sake of the natural world, too, that surrounds us and sustains us. Harvard\u2019s Humanist Chaplain Greg Epstein. Here\u2019s a reading from The Little Book of Atheist Spirituality by Andr\u00E9 Comte-Sponville, one of France\u2019s great contemporary philosophers. Where knowledge is concerned, the loss of faith changes nothing. Where morals are concerned, the loss of faith changes nothing or next to nothing. That you have lost your faith does not mean that you will suddenly decide to betray your friends or indulge in robbery, rape, assassination, and torture. \u201CIf God does not exist,\u201D says Dostoevsky\u2019s Ivan Karamazov, \u201Ceverything is allowed,\u201D not at all, for the simple reason that I will not allow myself everything. As Kant demonstrated, either morals are autonomous or they do not exist at all. If a person refrains from murdering his neighbor only out of fear of Divine Retribution his behavior is dictated not by moral values, but by caution, fear of the Holy Policemen, egoism. And if a person does good only with an eye to salvation, she is not doing good since her behavior is dictated by self-interest rather than by duty or by love and will thus not be saved. This is Kant, the enlightenment, and humanity at their best. Alain puts it beautifully in his Letters to Sergio Solmi on the Philosophy of Kant: \u201CEthics means knowing that we are spirit and thus have certain obligations for noblesse oblige. Ethics is neither more nor less than a sense of dignity. There is no need to believe in God. One need believe only in one\u2019s parents and mentors, one\u2019s friends, provided they are well chosen, and one\u2019s conscience.\u201D From Andr\u00E9 Comte-Sponville\u2019s The Little Book of Atheist Spirituality. This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, recalling the Cold War equation of atheism with evil in U.S. culture and why Greg Epstein sees nonreligious people to be a vital part of the interfaith movement. There\u2019s no place in this world where I\u2019ll belong when I\u2019m gone / And I won\u2019t know the right from the wrong when I\u2019m gone / And you won\u2019t find me singin\u2019 on this song when I\u2019m gone / So I guess I\u2019ll have to do it while I\u2019m here.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. \u2026worry \u2019bout my cares when I\u2019m gone / Won\u2019t be asked to do my share when I\u2019m gone / So I guess I\u2019ll have to do it while I\u2019m here / And I won\u2019t be running from the rain when I\u2019m gone / And I can\u2019t even suffer from the pain when I\u2019m gone / Can\u2019t say who\u2019s to praise and who\u2019s to blame when I\u2019m gone / So I guess I\u2019ll have to do it while I\u2019m here / Won\u2019t see the golden of the sun when I\u2019m gone / And the evenings and the mornings will be one when I\u2019m gone / Can\u2019t be singing louder than the guns when I\u2019m gone\u2026 Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, today exploring \u201CA New Humanism.\u201D I\u2019m speaking with the Humanist chaplain of Harvard University, Greg Epstein. He\u2019s an emerging leader in a movement he calls \u201Cthe New Humanism\u201D, an umbrella term for a nonreligious approach to life defined positively by ethical, spiritual, and even liturgical content. Greg Epstein speculates that negative attitudes towards atheists that turn up in U.S. opinion polls are rooted in and still influenced by 20th-century Cold War equations of atheism with communism, the enemy of Christianity and a source of evil and danger in the world. This had its apex in the anti-communist frenzy of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, but its remnants can also be heard in this speech of President Ronald Reagan, his famous \u201CEvil Empire\u201D speech of 1983. I, a number of years ago, I heard a young father, a very prominent young man in the entertainment world, addressing a tremendous gathering in California. It was during the time of the Cold War and communism and our own way of life were very much on people\u2019s minds and he was speaking to that subject. And suddenly, though, I heard him saying, \u201CI love my little girls more than anything,\u201D and I said to myself, \u201COh, no. Don\u2019t. You can\u2019t. Don\u2019t say that.\u201D But I had underestimated him. He went on, \u201CI would rather see my little girls die now still believing in God than have them grow up under communism and one day die no longer believing in God.\u201D In part, because of the cultural fallout of such ideas, Greg Epstein and others say atheists and agnostics have felt wounded and excluded in U.S. public life where religious language and identities are so central. In the past few years, of course, a new generation of successful atheist writers have also made their mark on American culture. In the heterogeneous circles in which Greg Epstein moves and works there is both appreciation for and debate about the new atheism of, for example, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris. Some have dubbed them \u201Cthe unholy trinity.\u201D Greg Epstein himself has been a somewhat controversial figure inside the movement he would like to pull together more cohesively. He\u2019s expressed concern about the spirit of the new atheism, that it has modeled the same kind of lack of respect for the religious that atheists have regretted in the way they\u2019ve been treated. Well, Godless communism was a canard that was exploited, I mean, to divide Americans and it\u2019s carried over again, because one of the things that I\u2019ve seen is that with this sort of resurgence of popular expressions of atheism, there\u2019s this conflict that has been stirred up between let\u2019s say progressive humanists and atheists and progressive people of other faiths, Christianity, Judaism, et cetera. Right, so that some atheist authors have done a lot to sort of say, you know, \u2018If you are a progressive believer in God \u2014\u2019 Right. \u2018\u2014 you\u2019re the enemy.\u2019 But most nonreligious people are not anti-religious and this is a key. Most nonreligious people are not anti-religious. All we ask is that we be treated just like anyone else and that our views be taken just as seriously in society and in culture as anyone else and in politics as well in that it\u2019s when we feel that this is not the case, that we\u2019re still living, in terms of the treatment of atheists in this country, the way that we were living back in the times of McCarthyism and, you know, McCarthy parading around and insulting Godless communists as a way of sort of rallying support to his cause. It\u2019s that point at which we say, you know, many of us are angry. However, I want to keep the focus, though, on the positive fact that there are most likely around a billion nonreligious people in the world, depending on how you count, between 30 and 40 or 50 million nonreligious people in this country. And the statistic is probably one in five young people in America, 18- to 25-year-olds, one in five of them in America is nonreligious. And what we\u2019re saying is that we want to build the best possible world for all human beings and that the only thing that can make this world a better place is human effort, human caring, compassion, creativity, and human reason. People don\u2019t realize that there\u2019s an organization like the Secular Student Alliance, which puts together groups of humanist and secular and atheist and agnostic students around the country and sponsors and supports them in doing community service, you know, in doing all kinds of wonderful activities. And so \u2014 Right. \u2014 these are some of the voices that I think we need to hear from now. You know, religion doesn\u2019t poison everything, and not everyone who believes in God is some kind of deluded fool. Mm-hmm. You know, but at the same time we have a big community. We have a community that\u2019s committed to doing good. It\u2019s time that the culture and the country recognize that. Yeah. I mean, ethical culture is also just, I think, a fascinating movement. It\u2019s a wonderful movement, you know, where \u2014 And absolutely committed to same kinds of social justice. Sure. And there are so many humanists and atheists within the Unitarian Universalist movement. Yes. Which is a powerful movement that has a great history in this country. And so, again, you know, I think that there needs to be more conversation about the fact that I\u2019m a humanist. I don\u2019t believe in any God; I believe in humanism. But if you disagree with me on that, let\u2019s work on what we do have in common, and it\u2019s so much. All we ask is that we are treated the same way everybody else is and that we\u2019re given the chance to air our views without prejudice. When you look at the history of action, the history of ideas, you know, where do you trace your legacy as a modern humanist, believing what you do, caring about what you do? You know, who are some role models for you? You mentioned Rabbi Sherwin Wine. I see myself as part of a great historical tradition that traces back thousands of years. It\u2019s ironic but, you know, I know a lot of religious people can say that for themselves and I can say that for myself as a humanist too. If you go back 3,000 years to ancient India, there were movements called the \u201CCharvaka\u201D and the \u201CLokayata\u201D movement, that the Nobel Prize-winning philosopher-economist Amartya Sen here at Harvard has said about which that there was more atheist and agnostic philosophy in ancient Sanskrit than in any other ancient language. And so I trace my roots back to the ancient East. But I also trace them back to ancient Greece, for example. In a few hundred years before Christ lived to have His divinity doubted, there was a philosopher in ancient Greece named Epicurus who said \u2014 Yes. \u2014 \u201CThere\u2019s nothing to fear in God. There\u2019s nothing to feel in death. Good can be achieved and evil can be endured.\u201D So that\u2019s humanist philosophy in ancient Greece. And then, you know, these kinds of movements are in many ways pushed underground when the imperial monotheisms come on the scene, Christianity, Islam, traditions that say, you know, \u2018You must believe in this one God,\u2019 are even less tolerant than other sort of polytheistic traditions \u2014 of traditions like mine that say there doesn\u2019t happen to be a God. And so, you know, my tradition was kind of pushed underground for much of pre-modern history, you know, much of the monotheistic period, until we get to this modern period in the last 200, 300 years where people start to question everything. It\u2019s the Industrial Revolution, it\u2019s the Scientific Revolution, where people, you know, learn to say that the way that we\u2019re going to figure out what exists and what doesn\u2019t exist, what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t, is through the scientific method. You know, then you have the 20th century in which people start to ask this question of, \u2018How can I have a community? How can I have a supportive group of people around me that affirms my beliefs as someone who, you know, believes that there\u2019s only one world, who doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural.\u2019 Right. And so a humanist movement in the 20th century emerges. And it emerges in the United States, and it emerges around the world. And I\u2019m part of that sort of movement that has emerged that people \u2014 most people just have never heard of. They don\u2019t know that it exists. Harvard\u2019s Humanist Chaplain Greg Epstein. Here\u2019s a passage from Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen\u2019s book The Argumentative Indian. The powerful presence of religious skepticism goes \u2014 or at least may appear to go \u2014 against a standard characterization of Indian culture, which is exceedingly common, that takes the form of focusing particularly on religion in interpreting Indian traditions. The religious connection is certainly there. \u2026 However, these grand explorations of every possible religious belief coexist with deeply skeptical arguments that are also elaborately explored (sometimes within the religious texts themselves), going back all the way to the middle of the second millennium B.C.E. The so-called \u201Csong of creation\u201D (or the \u201Ccreation hymn,\u201D as it is sometimes called) in the authoritative Vedas ends with the following radical doubts: \u201CWho really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produce? Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards with the creation of this universe; who then knows whence it has arisen?\u201D There are, in addition, a great many controversies between defenders of religiosity on one side and advocates of general skepticism on the other. The doubts sometimes take the form of agnosticism, sometimes that of atheism. But there is also the Gautama Buddha\u2019s special strategy of combining his theoretical skepticism about God with a practical subversion of the significance of the question by making the choice of good behavior completely independent of any God \u2014 real or imagined. From Amartya Sen\u2019s The Argumentative Indian. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, today exploring \u201CA New Humanism.\u201D And would you say \u2014 is there for you a strong philosophical component to the way you think about humanism, the way humanists interact with each other? I mean, you know, these great existential questions that I think lie behind religion, you know, where did we come from, what does it mean to live a worthy life? Right. Where are we going, you know, what really matters? Right. Yeah. I mean, we have to address these philosophical questions in order to be decent human beings no matter \u2014 no matter what tradition you come from. And I think that it\u2019s important to acknowledge that there are many religious people out there who are able to address these questions in their own way and live wonderfully meaningful purposeful good lives. So for me, you know, humanism is, again, an answer to these philosophical questions of where do I get the hope, where do I get the strength and the courage that I need in life. But it\u2019s a philosophy that is informed by the best knowledge that we have and can have about the world around us. And so, you know, we have to be informed by evolutionary theory. We have to be informed by the facts that we have in front of us which say that the world came most likely from what we know as the Big Bang billions of years ago and that it evolved over those billions of years and in a process of unguided evolution. And that \u2014 You know, and there are plenty of deeply religious people also who take those ideas \u2014 No, no \u2014 \u2014 seriously \u2014 \u2014 no, no. This is very true. And there\u2019s so many Christians and Jews and Muslims and others who agree with us on that issue. Right. I\u2019m just saying that my philosophy of life, which is informed by, you know, existentialists like Camus and it\u2019s informed by, you know, a whole range of philosophical traditions dating back, again, to the Charvakas in ancient India and Epicurus in ancient Greece. That it has to be informed by science. It has to be informed by evolution. And that we as humanists just take the very seriously. You know, we have been touching on this all along and, in fact, you and I met at an interfaith youth conference where there were people from every conceivable tradition as far as I could tell. And you were there presenting with one of your colleagues from the Humanist Chaplain\u2019s office. What\u2019s fascinating to me, and I really do think this is also a new development and this is something I have experienced, is that people who are nonreligious, not traditionally religious, or not religious at all actually, you know, are not just finding all kinds of ways as you\u2019re describing of filling that with meaning, of articulating that, but want to be part of the faith discussion. And want to be partners with people of faith, I find, in, you know, as you say, in many kinds of activities to build up our communities and to combat human crises. Right. I mean, I consider myself a proud member of and supporter of this other movement that we know exists in the country and around the world, which is the interfaith movement. Mm-hmm. And, I mean, I\u2019m so proud to work alongside people of different backgrounds. I was at that conference \u2014 Yeah. \u2014 the Interfaith Youth Core conference. Eboo Patel\u2019s. Eboo Patel\u2019s conference. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And, I mean, I was standing in line for dinner and I was standing behind two young high school girls who go to a Muslim high school in the Chicago area. And they were both wearing hijab and they just turned around very friendly and they said to me, \u2018So who are you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I am a chaplain at Harvard for atheists and agnostics and the nonreligious.\u2019 And they turned to themselves, you know, to each other and they said, \u2018Oh, you know, we were just having this conversation about how, you know, atheists aren\u2019t bad people; it\u2019s just that there are extreme people and extreme views with every community.\u2019 Hmm. And, so, you know, it\u2019s interesting. I mean, the first thing is really wonderful that they reached out to me and they said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re in many ways just like you.\u2019 But on the other hand, it\u2019s also interesting that they had to be having that conversation about, \u2018Oh, are atheists bad people or not?\u2019 Right? Right. That\u2019s interesting. Because we have these misunderstandings of one another. I mean, I do have to say, I mean, I think there is a need sometimes for people at atheist conferences to turn to one another and say, \u2018Oh, you know, Muslims aren\u2019t bad people. There are just extremists within every tradition.\u2019 Right. I mean, there\u2019s a real need for that on both sides. Goes both directions. Yeah. And it happens on both sides, by the way. That\u2019s another thing that I\u2019m really delighted that, you know, it\u2019s not just sniping back and forth. There\u2019s so much more than this seeming war of words between religion and atheism, that, in fact, really, we have a tremendous amount in common. Let me also just ask you this. I supposed because of the, especially because of the Dawkins and Hitchens and Harris books, there\u2019s just been a lot more talk and energy around the idea of atheism in American culture \u2014 Mm-hmm. \u2014 in the last year. Tell me what has surprised you in all of that? Is there anything that really, really threw you, that you didn\u2019t see coming? Something that\u2019s grown out of it that surprises you. I guess what I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by is that the new media has allowed for this idea that there is a new atheism out there. And therefore then we had our conference we called \u201CThe New Humanism.\u201D Right. Because really, you know, the atheism that you\u2019re seeing in the public square right now, it\u2019s not that new. There have been prominent articulate individuals, intellectuals who have challenged religion in the past, you know, a previous unholy trinity was Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche. Yeah. There were philosophers like Bertrand Russell and so many others. But what makes this atheism new today is that minority voices are more and more important in this world because we have the Internet and we have alternative television shows and more and more people are literate and they\u2019re consuming and they\u2019re reading and they\u2019re discussing, and it\u2019s wonderful. And so that\u2019s why I think you\u2019ve seen this growth in atheism is because atheism is a minority voice in our world that has always been out there and always will be. But now people are sort of forced to acknowledge and take it seriously because we are so much more connected than we ever were before. And so what surprises me, I guess, is to see just how powerful the new media are in that sense and then just say, \u2018Aha. Well, if you can call this not-so-new atheism a new atheism, then you\u2019d better call our humanism a new humanism too because we are going to be new in the sense that we are going to make a really big impact on the world stage in the years to come.\u2019 Greg Epstein in the Humanist chaplain at Harvard University. And here in closing some writing of the cell biologist Ursula Goodenough. She describes herself as \u201Ca religious naturalist,\u201D which is to say that she takes her sense of the sacred and of transcendent connection directly from her knowledge of the natural world. So we arrive here at what is, for many, the heart of it all. If there is a major tension between an approach like religious naturalism and the monotheistic traditions, it centers on the question of whether or not one believes in a personal god. Most people raised in the context of theistic traditions would probably say that \u201Cbeing religious\u201D means \u201Cbelieving in God.\u201D Indeed, when reminded that personal gods are not inherent in such systems as Buddhism or Taoism, they would likely question whether these traditions are really religions and not something else, like philosophies. For me, and probably for all of us, the concept of a personal, interested god can be appealing, often deeply so. In times of sorrow or despair, I often wonder what it would be like to be able to pray to God or Allah or Jehovah or Mary and believe that I was heard, believe that my petition might be answered. When I sing the hymns of faith in Jesus\u2019 love, I am drawn by their intimacy, their allure, their poetry. But in the end such faith is simply not available to me. I can\u2019t do it. I lack the resources to render my capacity for love and my need to be loved to supernatural Beings. And so I have no choice but to pour these capacities and needs into earthly relationships, fragile and mortal and difficult as they often are. Theism versus Non-Theism. The choice has been presented to us as saved versus damned, holy versus heathen. But when I talk to thoughtful theists, I encounter not a polarity, but a spectrum. Belief and faith in supernatural Being(s), when deeply wrought, are as intensely personal and individual and dynamic as our earthly relationships. They add another dimension, another opportunity for relationship, to be sure. But those of us incapable of embracing that dimension remain flooded with opportunities to open ourselves to human relationship and hence to fill our lives with the religious experience of love.
