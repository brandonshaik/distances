  "fullText": "Kate Braestrup is a chaplain to game wardens in the parks and forests of Maine. These are law enforcement officials in the wild, called in to respond to danger and disaster. And her work with them takes her, as she describes it, to hinges of human experience, moments where some lives are altered or ended and others swung in wholly unpredicted directions. Kate Braestrup calls this her \u201Cministry of presence\u201D to life and death, lost and found. And her life had its own unpredictable hinge in the sudden death of her state trooper husband, at the age of 39. She learned then, she says, about the finality of loss and the human capacity nevertheless to cope and to care. And from this, her sense of God emerges: I don\u2019t look for God or God\u2019s work in magic or in tricks or in, you know, saying \u201Cthis is what I want\u201D and then I get it. I look for God\u2019s work always in how people love each other, in just the acts of love that I see around me. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. Kate Braestrup met Drew Griffith when they were both students at the Corcoran School of Art and Design in Washington, D.C. After graduation, they moved to a small coastal town in Maine. Drew went into law enforcement and Kate became a writer. They had four children in eight years and found a spiritual home in Unitarian Universalism. In fact, Drew Griffith made plans to enter seminary and to embark on a second career as a chaplain to his fellow law enforcement officers. Then he died in an accident in his squad car, one morning in April 1996. Your husband, Drew \u2014 he was actually planning to attend seminary, and then he died suddenly. And then within a year of his death you had matriculated at the Bangor Theological Seminary, and as you write, planned to be ordained and serve his brothers and sisters in arms as a law enforcement chaplain? Yes. Mm-hmm. And you write in your book that you would say to people then when they asked you why you were there, you know, one of your answers was, you were there, because Drew couldn\u2019t be there. If \u2014 when you look back at that now, is that the right answer, is that the whole answer now as you see it? I mean, it still suffices in some ways, to answer the question with out answering it completely. What Drew did was to begin a process or to start hacking out the road that one of us was going to travel, and had he been the minister \u2014 had he lived and gone to seminary and become a minister, I would have been a very integral and intimate part of his ministry. When he died, two things happened. One was that I was in the same moment confronted by an unbearable loss and also by the realization that there were people and a community all around me that were there to help me bear it. In fact, the morning that he died, I was getting ready to leave with the kids, you know, finding their little shoes and their socks and whatever. And I looked out through the back window, because I heard a siren, and I saw an ambulance go by. And I remember actually thinking, \u201COh, I wonder who that\u2019s for,\u201D and then realizing at the same time, you know, I\u2019ve been living in this community long enough, finally living in one community long enough, so that I probably do know who it\u2019s for. And saying this sort of prayer and, you know, I hope they\u2019re all right and that I\u2019d be thinking about it through the day and I would find out who it was. And then as I was putting my shoes on right after that, I was thinking about how much I loved Drew and how nice it was to still be in love with him after 11 years of marriage. That was actually when he died. The ambulance was for him. That was for him. Yeah. So that was a very profound moment. I mean, it was a terrible moment, that whole day, the day of losing him, but it was a very revelatory day as well. I mean, revelatory of things that would take me years and probably will continue to take me years to sort of unpack, but as a kind of religious experience, that day really was one. Kate Braestrup spent her first summer during seminary in an independent study of her creation, riding patrol with police officers up and down the East Coast. She was ordained a Unitarian Universalist, or UU, minister. I spoke with her in 2008. She calls her ministry a \u201Cministry of presence\u201D \u2014 to game wardens responding to danger and disaster, to people who are wounded, and to family and friends left waiting or grieving. One thing the Buddhists say, or the Tibetan Buddhists, anyway, is that you prepare your whole life for your death. Right. And I encounter people when all of the practice that they\u2019ve been engaged in their whole lives without knowing it \u2026 Yeah, without knowing it. Yes. We are all practicing all the time for the test, and we don\u2019t know what the test is going to be. And I encounter them at those moments when all of a sudden here it is. This is the test. That becomes a kind of mindfulness about what we practice for \u2014 what I\u2019m practicing for, what I would want my parishioners or the game wardens to be sort of, you know, what seem like good practices for those moments when you\u2019re right up against it and you only have one moment when you get to choose or, in fact, you don\u2019t choose. You just be whatever it is you\u2019ve been. How does Unitarian Universalism, this tradition, how do you find that suited to this ministry, as you call it, your ministry of presence that you find yourself in now, with so many different kinds of people and so many unexpected situations? I mean, and maybe I\u2019m curious too about how the fact that you are a Unitarian Universalist chaplain, has that set you apart from maybe an image of chaplains that you might\u2019ve had previously in your life? Unitarian Universalism at its best is a way of looking at religious questions without requiring that the answer be found for everybody, without requiring that your answer be imposed on everybody else. There\u2019s a humble acceptance that I am not God. I am not the arbiter of these things, that the best I can be is a window through which the person that I\u2019m with can get a glimpse of something, and I can only do that by being as completely loving to them as I can be, whoever they are and wherever they are. The place that it\u2019s the most directly useful is when I\u2019m dealing with people who aren\u2019t religious at all. You know, UUs are very comfortable with people who aren\u2019t religious at all. It actually was trickier with people who are very strongly Christian, for example, because many of the prayers and many of the claims are exclusive. So to be able to use that language, I had to kind of come to an understanding. Many of the prayers that are important to them, to other people? Yes, exactly. Mm-hmm. I mean, can you tell me a story about a time when you, I don\u2019t know, either where this tradition really suited and was a gift in terms of what you were doing? Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe where it was challenging \u2026 An obstacle. \u2026 but where you really had to think about it. Where you really had to grapple with it. I can think of one, and this was kind of an amazing thing. There was a man who went ice skating in the moonlight on a river, and it was, I mean, it was a beautiful night and the ice was new. And when we got there, when I got there, there were sort of two skate lines leading from the dock to across this kind of white shining ice to a hole. And that was it. You know, he\u2019d basically made one pass and hit the soft spot and down he went. So, I mean, it was such a beautiful night that I could \u2014 on one level could have completely sympathized with him why he would want to do this alone, you know, on the river at night. And the other part of me is sort of standing there with these sheriff\u2019s deputies who were the first to respond, going, \u201CThis was so stupid. You don\u2019t do this.\u201D But, anyway, the sheriff\u2019s deputy had already notified his widow about 20 minutes before, so I said, \u201CWell, I\u2019ll go up and visit with her, because I\u2019ll be back tomorrow when the warden service dive team comes to retrieve the body.\u201D So I go up to the house and I\u2019m thinking \u2014 well, on the way up I ask the deputy what sort of family this was. You know, what was his sense? He goes, \u201CWell, let me put it this way, they seem pretty granola to me.\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CGreat!\u201D You know, \u201CI\u2019m granola.\u201D Now, so \u2026 Yeah. And I totally forget that of course I\u2019m wearing this sort of SWAT black, you know, utility uniform. You don\u2019t look granola in your uniform. No. And I\u2019ve got my \u2014 right. I\u2019ve got my clerical collar on and my ball cap and the whole bit. I mean, I look like some kind of bizarre priest or something. So, anyway, so I walk in through the door and the widow is on the floor, which is great. I actually really approve of the floor as a place for grieving, because you can\u2019t fall off. And she\u2019s sort of surrounded by neighbors or, you know, neighbors are already showing up. And she\u2019s got an old dog there. And the house is not just granola, but it\u2019s actually really cool. The man was an artist and so there\u2019s \u2014 his sculptures were all over the house. So I\u2019m just thinking, \u201COh, this is so great. This is so \u2026\u201D You know, I\u2019m responding to all of this stuff. And I kneel down beside her and say, you know, \u201CHello, Mrs. Brown. I\u2019m the chaplain for the Maine warden service.\u201D And she looks up at me and she says, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t like cops, and I hate religion.\u201D And, you know, I could have, if I had been newer on the job, I, you know, I can imagine myself saying, \u201CBut I\u2019m not really that religious.\u201D And I\u2019m not \u2014 you know, kind of arguing with her. Yeah. Instead it\u2019s like, OK, you know, there\u2019s all these people around. She\u2019s being taken care of and my job is not actually necessarily to minister personally. I just want to make sure that she\u2019s being taken care of. But quite, you know, chagrined, I sort of back off and I\u2019m talking to the neighbors and telling them, you know, what we\u2019re going to be doing the next day and what she\u2019ll need to know so they can transfer that information to her. So by the next day she had, I suppose, been told by her friends and neighbors that the chaplain really isn\u2019t such a bad person. And also I\u2019ve toned down my more sort of paramilitary look, so I\u2019m looking a little squishier around the edges and I\u2019ve taken off my clerical collar. Finally, they make the recovery. And I go back to the house, and by that time I\u2019d already asked her, you know, \u201CWhen do you want to see him after we make the recovery?\u201D And she said, \u201CRight away. I want to see him as soon as possible.\u201D Which is, in fact, almost always what people do say. And I said, \u201COK.\u201D And I go back down to the river and I make sure that we\u2019ve put a blanket around him because a body bag can look kind of like a garbage bag, and I never like that. So we put a blanket over him to kind of soften that. And he\u2019s lying on the riverbank. And so the widow and I show up, and everybody else bails out. Everybody else leaves because they think there\u2019s going to be some awful, like, emotional scene \u2026 Right. \u2026 that\u2019s going to be terrible. And actually, it was so wonderful. I mean, she just \u2014 she walked right up to him and started talking to him and patting him and then sang to him. She was singing Cole Porter. And, I mean, it was so wonderful. I mean, it was so gorgeous and so holy. And I think, even though, you know, I really anticipated that being a Unitarian would really help me out right from the get-go, it didn\u2019t. But then I think at least in the long run what it lets me do is back off and allow God to just do what God does and not feel like I have to shape it or guide it or force it into a certain place that accords with anything, that I can really just let it be. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Kate Braestrup. She was a writer before she became a Unitarian Universalist minister and chaplain to game wardens in the wilds of Maine. In 2007, she published a memoir called Here If You Need Me. You said earlier that there\u2019s this notion, a Tibetan notion, that rings true for you that, whether we know it or not, we\u2019re spending our whole lives preparing for our death. But a lot of the cases you deal with are people who are experiencing the death of people they love. And I don\u2019t think any of us feel like \u2014 like we can prepare for that or that the universe even makes sense if we\u2019re supposed to. Right. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing we don\u2019t have to consciously prepare. Right. And, you know, you make this point \u2014 I\u2019ve had a couple of conversations lately and something that\u2019s come up is this theme of providence that runs through American history. Yeah. And the idea that we call something providence when it worked out our way. Right. And I heard an echo of, you know, you talk about miracle, about how we will call something a miracle when it is completely unlikely and has a wonderful ending, but you also all the time experience completely unlikely events that are not wonderful. That end badly. Yeah. And, I mean, I wondered if you would tell the story of Christina and of Anna Love. Anna. Yeah. That was one name I did not change. I wondered about that. Yeah. Because she has an improbable name, the policewoman. Exactly. Anna Love. So I went and got her to read the book and said, \u201CIs it all right if I use your name the way it is?\u201D Yeah, you couldn\u2019t change that name. Yeah. I mean, because that is a context in which you ponder this religious idea of a miracle. Right. In all its complexity. Well, Christina was a young woman who was abducted and raped and murdered and left in the woods. And so the warden service was involved, along with many, many other agencies, in both recovering her body, evaluating \u2014 gathering and evaluating the evidence, and it was a very painful experience for everybody involved. Obviously, for her family it was excruciating. But it was one of those that kind of tests a lot of our sense of, you know, what it means to live in Maine, you know, of safety, of whether our children are safe or whether we are safe, of, you know, what do you do about sort of this evil that swoops down completely at random? And I suppose that\u2019s where the issue of miracles comes in, that so many things had to happen in the right way, or the wrong way, depending on how you put it, for this particular young woman to meet this particular guy in the parking lot at 7:00 in the morning. I mean, that is as improbable as any miracle. And because of that, a miracle to me can\u2019t just be something that was providential, that everything had to line up just right in order for it to happen, because bad things happen that way too. Yeah. And really bad things happen that way too. And evil people have uncanny luck sometimes. And, you know, I suppose we can all sit around and say, \u201CWell, you know, God intended for this to happen so that this happens and that.\u201D OK. But that ends up, again, arguing \u2014 what is that? It\u2019s the naturalistic fallacy arguing ought from is and this is how it had to be because this is how it is. If I look at it from another perspective, and this is really the perspective I maintain, that I don\u2019t look for God or God\u2019s work in magic or in tricks or in, you know, saying \u201Cthis is what I want\u201D and then I get it. I look for God\u2019s work always in how people love each other, in just the acts of love that I see around me. So this tested that. This event tested that for me, because, in general, I don\u2019t get involved with a lot of sexual predators and murderers. I\u2019m much more likely to be dealing with accidents or people who\u2019ve done something stupid or they got drunk and did something stupid, but they weren\u2019t actively malicious. So to look for where love was in this situation, the very obvious place to look would be in the hearts and the hands of the guys who did their best to find her and to make things right for her and for her family. And with all the limitation in that, with all the, you know, with all of the \u2026 That they couldn\u2019t, in fact \u2026 That they couldn\u2019t. Yeah. \u2026 turn back time or \u2026 Right. \u2026 make her be alive. Right. Make that not have happened. They couldn\u2019t fix it. Mm-hmm. And the fact, actually, that they are willing to go and respond to these things when they can\u2019t fix it is actually, in some ways, the most beautiful thing I see. I mean, there\u2019s one thing to get to be Superman, right. You swoop in and save the day, and it\u2019s very satisfying when that happens. I love it. Mm-hmm. I love it, you know, when they find the kid in the woods before the last breath has left his body. And that\u2019s wonderful. They bring him out alive; I love it. But what\u2019s amazing to me is that these guys are willing to go and do it. You mean the police officers, the game wardens. The police officers and the game wardens, yeah. That they\u2019ve actually deliberately set up their lives so that they\u2019re going to have to go and do these things that are excruciatingly painful and that don\u2019t fix or undo the harm and the evil that they see. Mm-hmm. And in this particular case it was a woman \u2026 Yep. Anna Love. \u2026 police officer named Anna Love. Yeah, and actually what was so neat about it was that Anna was sort of the primary detective on the case. She\u2019s this very serious young woman. I\u2019ve known her actually for quite a long time now. And she\u2019s very easy to picture as a detective. She\u2019s very smart, you know, very serious, kind of a little pale heart-shaped face. And at the time that she was investigating this, and that meant basically comb through all of this information and try to come up with plausible places to look for a suspect, did that, they found the suspect. Then she has to interview him repeatedly and interview all the witnesses and interview him again and then go with him to the scene. You know, they go do this whole thing. And this is all within just three days, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, she really closed this case. Yeah, she did. In between all of this, she would duck into the lieutenant\u2019s office with a breast pump, because she had a newborn baby at home and she was sending bottles of milk home to her husband, who\u2019s also a police officer, so that he could give them to the baby. And I just, I thought, \u201CThere\u2019s something just gorgeous about that,\u201D you know? You wrote, \u201CIf ours were a sensible culture, little girls would play with Anna Love action figures, badge in one hand, breast pump in the other.\u201D Yeah. You know, and kind of the perfect detective too, for this case. Mm-hmm. Somehow. You know, there are these paradoxes, right, that you can\u2019t fix or make them fit together. You can\u2019t kind of shave away the edges so that they match. You just have to let them sit there as separate things. And one of them was here. It was on one hand you had this terrible event that was not right and not just and was cruel and on every level harmful and hurtful and terrible. And on the other hand, you have all of these guys responding. All of these guys motivated by love. And one of them is Anna Love, who is a breastfeeding mother. Right. And she\u2019s the one who nails this guy. And, you know, it\u2019s not as if all of that fixes Christina\u2019s death; it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s just that they both exist in the same time and the same space, which, I guess, it isn\u2019t enough and it is enough. You know, you point something out that\u2019s very simple, but really striking and unsettling in good ways and bad, that even when the miracle, and, you know, you say we can call things miracles, but it\u2019s not \u2014 the picture\u2019s more complicated than that. Mm-hmm. But even when it is of a life restored, that is always a temporary restoration. Mm-hmm. Yep. And you say that most of the time, perhaps, \u201Ca miracle can only be the resurrection of love beside the unchanged fact of death.\u201D Then if we look at \u2014 and, you know, this is an argument I have with, probably a continuous argument I have with Christianity. Is I always felt that it was answering a question I wasn\u2019t asking. And the question of sort of if you decide that the most important thing, you know, the highest possible value is life, that it\u2019s breath in the body and walking around and eating sandwiches and whatever, then you\u2019re lost. Then you\u2019ve lost. You know, because we\u2019re all going to die. So then you have to posit this whole other set of things that you can\u2019t see and you can\u2019t connect with. And as I said, I\u2019m a practical person. I want to be able to see it and I want to be able to do it. So if I posit instead that the most important thing is love, then what I have is, yes, I have a world that\u2019s full of suffering and evil and pain, and I have something to do. I have something to look for, and I have something to do. And to me that\u2019s \u2014 that works better. That, um, is of more practical value, um, than fretting about, you know, OK, is death real? Do we live forever? What does eternal life mean? Would I want eternal life? You know, if there\u2019s a hell doesn\u2019t everybody get eternal life? Just some of us in hell and some of us in heaven? You know, I mean all of that stuff kind of can be, you know, you can still talk about it, but it becomes less of a pressing issue.

Coming up, more with Kate Braestrup on the finality of loss, and the human capacity nevertheless to cope and to care. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Kate Braestrup, discussing her experiences as a chaplain to the game wardens of Maine. She accompanies these law enforcement officers on search and rescue missions in moments of danger and disaster. This \u201Cministry of presence,\u201D as she calls it, was precipitated by the accidental death in 1996 of her husband, Drew, a state trooper. In her 2007 memoir, Here If You Need Me, she writes: \u201C\u2026 if anyone needs proof that God has a sense of humor, here it is: I am a middle-aged mother of four who primarily works with young, very fit men. My preferred habitat is a warm, well-stocked library, yet I work in the outdoors, with outdoorsmen. But the crowning irony,\u201D she continues, \u201Cis that I, a famously loquacious person, have a job that mostly requires me to just show up, shut my mouth, and be.\u201D You know, you talk about that God has a sense of humor that that\u2019s something you experience. And I wanted to ask you generally about from this work you\u2019ve done and this life you\u2019ve lived, other qualities of God that you have observed. Well, I mean, you know, the longer I work and live the simpler my theology gets. And there\u2019s many, many things I\u2019m willing to entertain and think about and talk about, but fundamentally it still comes back to that God is love. And I mean that pretty literally, that God is, if nothing else, and that\u2019s a big if, but if nothing else, God is that force that drives us to really see each other and to really behold each other and care for each other and respond to each other. And for me, that is actually enough. That cultivating it, that thinking about it, worshipping it, working towards it, taking care of it, nurturing it in myself, nurturing it in other people, that that really is a life\u2019s work right there, and it doesn\u2019t have to be any bigger than that. You know, God doesn\u2019t have to be out in the next solar system over bashing asteroids together. Right? You know, it\u2019s plenty just the God that I work with. And then, you know, the question is, and this is something I know you grapple with all the time, I mean, how do you draw that line to this God of love from the child who\u2019s gone missing, the beloved husband who just skated on the lake to ice that was too thin, the young woman who was raped and whose body is left in the woods? Well, the first two are easier than the last one. The first two, you know, it was obvious in absolutely everything around us and everyone, you know, that the child is loved. The people who show up have no trouble at all loving that child enough to risk themselves to try to find her or him. And, I mean, once you kind of accept that death is a given, then that becomes the thing to look for and to mark. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t \u2026 The love and the care that surrounds. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I tell that to people all the time, and they do find it helpful. I mean, it isn\u2019t just me. Like, they will say, you know, I will say, if someone asks, you know, \u201CWhere was God in this?\u201D I\u2019ll say, \u201CGod was in all the people that came to try to help, to try to find your child.\u201D And in the case of the skater, I mean, that was an easy one too. It was just, you know, what an amazing life he must\u2019ve had in order to get to die that way. I don\u2019t mean to get to drown in a pond; I mean to be, you know, so loved and so honored and, you know, to have someone who loved him so much she would come and stand by the river and sing Cole Porter to him. I mean, that\u2019s pretty good. You know? And so I often say, you know, the question isn\u2019t whether we\u2019re going to have to do hard, awful things, because we are. And we all are. The question is whether we have to do them alone. And in my experience, I mean, half of the time when I\u2019m going into the woods when we\u2019re responding to a tragedy, the making of the tragedy is someone who was willing to risk his life for something really as evanescent as, you know, excitement. I mean, he was, you know, seriously. I mean, he was driving a snowmobile 70 miles an hour, and he bashes into a tree. I mean, we risk our lives all the time. Mm-hmm. Even just in terms of how we live day to day. I mean, forget even soldiers going to war or police officers, you know, or Secret Service agents throwing themselves in front of the president or whatever. I mean, we\u2019re talking about people willing to risk their lives just, you know, you and I are willing to risk our lives just to get to, you know, the grocery store two minutes faster. So, you know, don\u2019t tell me that human beings value life that highly. We really don\u2019t. Mm-hmm. But we definitely value our connection to each other. And that, I think, we are less likely to risk. Mm-hmm. In a way, I mean, it sounds crazy but actually in a way that makes sense. I think what we\u2019re less apt to be aware of and reconciled to is that we will lose everyone we love as well. Right. And that\u2019s a lot harder. Fortunately, I will say, and this is an important part, we know how to do it. So I know that whenever I used to think about, you know, what would happen if Drew died, which of course I did think about because he was a state trooper and, you know, you think about that. Mm-hmm. I mean, state troopers were killed before him in my experience. So, you know, what I would always think about was, \u201CWell, if anything happened to Drew, I would just lose my mind.\u201D And what I discovered and what we all discovered is actually, you don\u2019t lose your mind. You did lose Drew \u2026 You should be so lucky. \u2026 and you didn\u2019t lose your mind, right? No, and not only that, even if you wanted to, you don\u2019t get to lose your mind. You have to stay and you have to do it without him. So the loss is going to be real, and there is no anesthesia. So that was a thing I learned. What I also learned, however, is that there is something in us that knows how to do that. And I \u2014 that lesson gets repeated for me over and over when I do death notifications. What I find is people know how to do this. They know how to absorb that, the impact of that blow. It knocks them down. And all I do is I go down with them and sit on the floor and be there with them and hold them if they want to be held. And after about 20 minutes \u2014 and I was just talking to some wardens about this and we all agreed, it\u2019s almost never more than 20 minutes \u2014 they will come up. They will come back to themselves, and they will ask a very sensible question, which is usually, \u201CWhere is he? When can I see him?\u201D I mean, to me there\u2019s something miraculous just about that. I mean, like a little tiny resurrection. Like how can you do that? And we\u2019re talking about, you know, women who\u2019ve lost a child, which is one of those ones where I just, you know, think, \u201COh, I\u2019d lose my mind.\u201D Right. Yeah. Yeah. They don\u2019t, and they somehow manage to do it and to continue to be loving, meaningful beings in the world. And that\u2019s amazing. And there\u2019s something very encouraging in the sense of giving courage. There\u2019s something encouraging about that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, I\u2019m with author and chaplain Kate Braestrup. Her book Here If You Need Me ends with another story from her life of chaplaincy in the parks and forests of Maine. An elderly woman with Alzheimer\u2019s disease has gone missing. Kate Braestrup describes the gaggle of law enforcement officers and other community members \u2014 high school soccer players, the local equestrian club, even supervised prisoners from a correctional facility \u2014 who all join in the search for this woman. And she focuses her telling of this story on the reaction of the woman\u2019s son, Jim, to this gathering. He says, \u201CEveryone in the world is here. It\u2019s a miracle.\u201D At the end of your book, you \u2014 you begin to tell the story of a woman who goes missing and all the people who come out to search and care and prepare casseroles. Mm-hmm. You don\u2019t tell us how the story ends because, you say, that is not the point. Right. Well, I mean, you know how the story ends. That story? Yeah. Tell me. Well, I mean, she was an old lady. That was probably 10 years ago. How did the story end? She died one day. Yeah. So, I mean, that was sort of part of it. I mean, of course we know how the story ends. Mm-hmm. And what was lovely about that particular time was just how clearly her son saw it and articulated it. It\u2019s actually more common than not for the family of someone who\u2019s lost in the woods to come to the search scene, see all these people, and go, \u201COh, my God. Look at all these people. You know, we didn\u2019t know this many people cared about us.\u201D You know, they get it. Mm-hmm. And that\u2019s before they know what\u2019s happened to their kid or their dad or whatever. But in this case he, you know, he said very clearly, you know, \u201CLook at all these people. This is a miracle.\u201D And that is. That is the miracle of human life for me. That is \u2014 that\u2019s it. Is all that care that \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 we can gather around each other and ourselves. Yeah. Right. I was thinking while I was reading your stories about Dorothy Day, you know, the story about her. Mm-hmm. It was when she watched all the outpouring of care after the San Francisco earthquake, that she watched that and said, \u201CWhy can\u2019t we live this way all the time?\u201D All the time. Yeah. And I think that, I think that, you know, whenever we have a natural disaster, which we seem to be having plenty of these days \u2026 Yes. \u2026 or we have September 11th, you know \u2026 Right. \u2026 there\u2019s this story of the tragedy, and then you get the stories of how people leapt in and were courageous and took care of each other. Yes. And yet we treat that as kind of this unusual occurrence and then it goes back to normal. Yeah. But it strikes me that you live \u2014 you see that as the story we should be telling ourselves all the time, at least as much as the story of the tragedies. And as more normal than I think we treat it. Yes. Yeah. Do you think it \u2026 And more reliable. More reliable. Yeah. Huh. It\u2019s more reliable. You know, it doesn\u2019t always work. I mean, you know, there are awful stories about people who \u2014 Kitty Genovese and I think there was even a more recent one about people who are hurt and nobody comes. Right. And actually, that was the thing that was so traumatic, from my perspective, about Katrina, was here are these people suffering and nobody\u2019s coming. And I can\u2019t go help, and nobody\u2019s going to help. I mean, that\u2019s actually the worst thing, I think. The most traumatic thing is not suffering; it\u2019s suffering alone. And, um, I actually, you know, I actually think in a lot of ways we are getting more responsive and more attuned. You know, this surprises people, but I\u2019m actually relatively optimistic about that. I think when \u2014 that we know more about tragedy so there seem to be so many more of them, but we actually do respond to them. We do care about them. And I\u2019m sure there are many places in the world that they haven\u2019t lost this. It\u2019s just that too many of us spend too much time watching television or something where community response isn\u2019t normal and, you know, what you see is, like, the CSI team come in. But to grow up in a community or to be in a community where everybody really knows how to do this has been very educational for me. And so whatever it is that allows people to sort of see a need and realize that they have the capacity to help fill it and to go and do it, it\u2019s alive and well in Maine. And it was a big part of what I understood from Drew\u2019s death. It was a big part of that first day, was not just I\u2019ve lost Drew but I\u2019ve lost Drew and here come all these people who are going to hold me. And that was just, you know, that was just astonishing to me and \u2014 and beautiful. Tell me something that\u2019s happened to you lately that\u2019s on your mind as, you know, you continue to ponder what faith means, what religion means, in this particular vocation that you\u2019ve chosen or been drawn to. Well, not a whole lot\u2019s happened this week. OK. Um, yeah, um, actually, I might go back to the National Law Enforcement Memorial. Once a year, around May 16th, there\u2019s sort of a convocation of widows and orphans and widowers and partners and family members of officers who\u2019ve been killed in the line of duty in the previous year. And the names of the officers are added to the National Memorial at Judiciary Square, and they have a number of services and some, oh, therapeutic events and various other stuff for the kids and for the widows. And, um, and the first time I went was in 1997. That was a year after Drew died. And I was invited back, and it was such a nice thing to get to go back as a minister and as a chaplain, rather than just as a new widow. Mm-hmm. I mean, that was a really nice thing. But there were two things that happened that surprised me. One was I went with these game wardens who had actually volunteered to go. The state of Maine has had a lot of budget issues \u2014 so there wasn\u2019t any funding for them to go \u2014 so they took their own time to come with me, which was very nice of them and actually made a huge difference in how the week felt. But, um, so we get down there, and I told myself that I wasn\u2019t going to look at Drew\u2019s name on the wall until I was all done with my official responsibilities. And I felt sort of melodramatic about this, like I was kind of being, you know, I was kind of being silly. Yeah. And, you know, it\u2019s been 12 years and it\u2019s just his name and I see his name all the time and, you know, whatever. But I decided, OK, I\u2019ll just \u2014 to be safe. So the candlelight vigil comes, and I give my prayer. And then, still in my robe and my collar and my stole and everything, I go around and I find the game wardens who have been waiting for me, and I said, \u201CWell, you know, before we do anything else, I guess I better go see Drew\u2019s name.\u201D So they said, \u201CAll right.\u201D They said, \u201CBut when you\u2019re done we\u2019re going to take you to this bar we found.\u201D And I said, \u201CReally?\u201D And they said, \u201CYeah. It\u2019s this cop bar, and it\u2019s just full of cops. You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CAll right.\u201D So we go around and I\u2019m, of course, meeting people and talking to people that I know and whatever. And I\u2019m perfectly fine, perfectly calm. Get to the little section of the wall that has name, I see his name, and I\u2019m gone. I mean, I almost fell down. It was as if it was brand-new. So that was revealing, I think, and humbling for me. I think I had been feeling like maybe, OK, I\u2019m over it. I\u2019m not where all these brand-new widows are anymore. And I thought, well, OK, for that moment I was, and that\u2019s OK. And I guess, you know, I try very hard not to get all emotional in front of the game wardens. Well, I blew that. You know, because I\u2019m the helper, not the helpee. Well, OK, I blew that. Um, so then we go, and I take off my robe but I still have my little skirt and my clerical shirt and my clerical collar, and we go to the cop bar. And it was literally a bar stuffed with, you know, mostly men with very short haircuts and badges. And they\u2019re all sort \u2014 you know, the music\u2019s very loud, and they\u2019re all drinking sort of Miller Lite and singing along to \u201CSweet Home Alabama.\u201D This is not normally my scene when I go to bars, which I don\u2019t anymore because I\u2019m middle-aged and I have children and whatnot. But, um, it was so much fun. And I realized, actually, that it was like being at a family reunion where you know everybody there is your cousin, but you just haven\u2019t met them all yet. You know, it was like being with your family. And how did those two experiences work together for you? Um, I probably, between, you know, re-experiencing the loss as loss and being reminded again that, you know, what you lose, you really lose. You don\u2019t get to have it back. And, you know, all of the wonderful things that happened to me and happened to my children and the people who love us and my second husband, who\u2019s darling and the kids love him and I love him and all this, all of that is wonderful. And Drew is still dead. Mm-hmm. And that\u2019s just how it is. And, you know, that that doesn\u2019t actually need to be redeemed. It can just be there. And, um, it doesn\u2019t have to be fixed. It can just be there. And at the same time, immediately almost, being held up and, you know, I mean, literally held up, actually, at the time when I almost fell over. But, you know, that there was always still this sense of a community that will hold us. And in this case it happened to be the community of cops, but it wouldn\u2019t have to be, you know. It was a pretty amazing, you know and that \u2014 and that\u2019s really what it comes down to for me, that those two things are enough. Kate Braestrup is a chaplain with the Maine Warden Service and the author of several books, including Here If You Need Me. In closing, a few more lines from that book. She writes: \u201CSometimes I remember something funny that Drew once said, some offhand comment that still cracks me up, and I think: Ah! To be able to make someone \u2026 laugh years after I\u2019m gone, that is all the immortality I could ever ask for\u2026. If you are, in Christian terms, following Christ, or in Unitarian Universalist terms, completely and wholly in love, then you are in heaven no matter where you are. If you are not in love, you are in hell, no matter where you are.\u201D She concludes, \u201CThe stories we tell of heaven and hell are not about how we die, but about how we live.\u201D At onbeing.org, watch a playful collection of interviews we did with a bunch of Unitarian Universalists. They redefine what it means to be \u201CUU\u201D; you might be surprised at what you hear. And while you\u2019re there, you can find a link to our blog on Tumblr.
