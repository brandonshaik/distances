  "fullText": "You will never understand this, but the best Ramadan I ever spend in my life is always in America because I feel sometimes I am the only person fasting. What I enjoy about it, and what I have always treasured about it, is that I saw it as a personal faith. First day of Ramadan happened to be the first field trip of the year. And I was so excited about this field trip because we\u2019d get to go to McDonald\u2019s for lunch. So when I found out that Ramadan was starting on the day of the field trip, I was so mad. Ramadan commemorates the month when the Qur\u2019an\u2019s first verses were revealed to the Prophet Mohammed. It\u2019s marked by recitation of the Qur\u2019an, prayer, and fasting from sun-up to sundown. The Ramadan fast is a spiritual discipline of commitment and reflection. But it is also meant to align Muslims with the larger experience of need and hunger in the world. And it is a period of intimacy \u2014 as well as parties. Waking when the world is quiet, before the sun rises, for breakfast. Prayers with one\u2019s family. Ending or \u201Cbreaking\u201D the fast after nightfall in celebration and prayers with friends and strangers. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. This show grew out of an invitation to Muslim listeners leading up to Ramadan in 2009. We asked them to reflect with us on what it means to be part of what often is referred to in the abstract as \u201Cthe Muslim world.\u201D We received hundreds of responses from people all over the world and were especially struck by the vivid stories about Ramadan itself that nearly everyone had to tell \u2014 across a remarkable spectrum of life and spiritual sensibility. We begin with Samar Jarrah, who grew up in Kuwait and has lived throughout the Middle East. She came to the U.S. two decades ago. I just got back from Jordan, actually, last night \u2014 very late last night. And my family was telling me, \u201CWhy can\u2019t you just stay a bit longer and spend the week from Ramadan in Jordan or in Egypt?\u201D And I said, \u201CYou will never understand this, but the best Ramadan I ever spend in my life is always in America because I feel sometimes I\u2019m the only person fasting.\u201D It\u2019s more strenuous. I feel like every day is a jihad for me. It\u2019s a struggle to maintain my faith, to maintain my fast despite the amazing food around me and the smells. If I go shopping or if I go to the mall, there is food everywhere. Everybody is eating except myself, and this brings me amazing strength. And I wake up very early in the morning. I can be lecturing, I can be driving to my classes a hundred miles each way, I can be feeding the homeless, I can be doing amazing stuff that I would not be doing if I were living in a Muslim country because the whole country would be fasting and I would be one of many. Last year, I was giving two lectures in a row in Sarasota to a college, and the lecture starts one hour and a half before the time of breaking the fast. So I was giving the lecture, and at around 7:45, I paused. And I just took a date and a sip of water, and I told my students, \u201CI\u2019m breaking my fasting.\u201D And I continued another hour and a half, and then I had another hour and a half to get back home. And I was not weak; I was full of life. And I felt, \u201CMy God, now I understand what it means to be fasting Ramadan in America.\u201D I bet you, if I was living in my mom\u2019s house, I would be dead if I missed my meal half an hour after the time of the breaking of the fast. This experience is priceless, and that\u2019s why I did everything. I even paid extra money for my ticket to make sure I arrived before Ramadan starts because this is where I feel I\u2019m really fasting with a meaning and a purpose. Especially, it happens that, during Ramadan, we go and feed the homeless. So there is so much food I am giving those people, and people are telling me, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you taste this? Why don\u2019t you taste this?\u201D And I tell them, \u201CI can\u2019t. I\u2019m fasting.\u201D And they say, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you just have a sip of water?\u201D And I say, \u201CI can\u2019t. I\u2019m fasting.\u201D And you can\u2019t imagine how blessed I feel that I\u2019m feeding homeless people, and I am fasting, and I can\u2019t touch the food. And that\u2019s the whole idea of Ramadan, not to be able to eat, to feel with the poor and the deprived. And I just love it. My name is Wajahat Ali, and I\u2019m from the Bay Area of California. Wajahat is a playwright, a lawyer, and a first-generation Pakistani-American. I remember when I used to go to UC Berkeley, we used to always say \u201Cbreaking the fast.\u201D We\u2019re \u201Cbreaking the fast,\u201D we\u2019re \u201Cbreaking the fast,\u201D we\u2019re \u201Cbreaking the fast.\u201D But I remember my Arabic teacher is like, \u201CNo, linguistically, what you\u2019re doing is actually you are opening your fast. You\u2019re opening your fast with a date.\u201D So from then on, I\u2019ve always said \u201Copening my fast.\u201D And essentially, that act of worship continues throughout the month. It doesn\u2019t end with the fast, right? And I\u2019ve been growing up non-Muslims my whole life. So sometimes, they give you \u2014 most of my friends were being atheists, also, and agnostics, which I thought was great, and Christians. So sometimes \u2014 once in a while, they\u2019d give these snide comments. They\u2019re like, \u201CHow does a Muslim fast during Ramadan if he has, like, sugar problems? And what does a Muslim do if he has to eat?\u201D I kept telling them that Ramadan is not just predicated upon eating or not eating or drinking or not drinking. It\u2019s a state of mind. And it\u2019s an attempt to achieve God consciousness that carries on throughout the day. So even if you can\u2019t eat the date, you can be nice to your neighbor. You can repair relations with your family members. And you can help prepare the meal for the Muslim who fasts. And so your fast continues after you open it with the date. There\u2019s a great story that I tell, and I wish I had more opportunities to tell it. Islam has a lot of beauty in it. And I can understand the viewpoint of many in America who see the violence and arrogance espoused by reactionaries, which mars the beauty of Islam in their eyes. And that\u2019s understandable. As a Muslim-American, I can understand why people would have that reaction and limited understanding of Islam. But it\u2019s also a religion which inspires the poetry of Rumi, whose love for the divine has created verses that survived 800 years and nourished the spirits of lovers around the globe. And when it comes to Ramadan, some of the most beautiful moments that exist within the Muslim community and within Islam become manifest during this month. And I remember one time when I went to Mecca, which is the holiest site of pilgrimage for Muslims \u2014 I was in Mecca, and I was doing umrah. Umrah is essentially like a mini version of hajj \u2014 it\u2019s the easiest way I can explain it. And I was in college, and it was during Ramadan, and I had just finished umrah, which took about two and a half hours. And I haven\u2019t eaten anything, and I\u2019m fasting, and it\u2019s hot, and I\u2019m wearing these two white shawls. And I remember praying that, \u201CI wish the sun would set. And I\u2019m hungry.\u201D And I remember in the Masjid al-Haram \u2014 that\u2019s the name of the mosque with what you call the black cube, the Kaaba, in it. The sun set, and the entire world just woke up, and everyone went to the mosque. I remember about 15 or 20 children came up to me and each one taking my hand and tugging my finger with smiles on their faces saying, \u201CCome, come, come. Come to the mosque, come to the mosque,\u201D in Arabic. Basically, what they had done is they had prepared a small bowl with a date and some fruit and some milk \u2014 thousands of them, thousands of these bowls on these mats for all the Muslims around the city who were coming to the mosque. So these children, who I\u2019ve never met before in this life, just one after another, one after another, just said, \u201CCome to the bowl that I prepared.\u201D \u201CCome eat the bowl that I prepared.\u201D \u201CNo, please eat my bowl.\u201D \u201CPlease eat my bowl.\u201D And I sat there eating this bowl, opening my fast next to strangers I\u2019ve never met before, and greeted them with peace in the mosque, in the holy mosque. There was just a sense of overwhelming beauty. And it\u2019s a memory that I cherish that sometimes, when you see the violence and extremism and the arrogance and the ignorance and the anger \u2014 that memory nourishes me. Yanina Vaschenko lives in Dallas. In an essay she wrote to us, she shared how Ramadan was a way into Islam for her. So I first fasted for Ramadan, and I loved it. It was strange because I have never been a person who skipped a meal or gave up the extra piece of cake. So how could I not eat or drink the whole day, over and over again? It had to be something bigger than my base desires that was driving me. And that was the most peaceful I had ever felt. It was unreal. Of course, it was not something I was going to forget about, but it led me further and further into Islamic practices. Yanina\u2019s family moved from Russia to Texas when she was eight years old. She was raised in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, spent several years as a nondenominational Christian, and converted to Islam in her early twenties. I know a lot of converts, and I know the convert syndrome, especially with Islam, and that is to be better than and more pious than the born Muslims because you feel like you have to make up for the fact that you\u2019re starting late or you don\u2019t know all the rules and things like that. And I don\u2019t have that feeling at all. So I don\u2019t use Arabic words in my speech, I don\u2019t dress a certain way, because, in Islam, it doesn\u2019t say you have to. I mean, I haven\u2019t found any proof that you have to. And that\u2019s the good thing about it. This religion in particular tells you, \u201CYou choose your own path. You use your own brain.\u201D You act according to the rules that have been given, but there\u2019s always that emphasis on finding out the best way to do something. Two special resonance moments, I guess, would be the first time I fasted for Ramadan. I actually did it for the whole 30 days. It was just a completely new experience for me. You just get this indescribable peaceful feeling. It\u2019s almost \u2014 you don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening. But not only are you practicing self-restraint, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re doing something for a higher power. I guess that\u2019s where the peaceful feeling comes in. And that was the first time I had ever felt that way before, so that\u2019s a special memory. Also, it\u2019s hard to learn the movements and the prayers in Arabic and do them the correct way and sequence. It took a while of practicing in order to commit that to memory. So when I could do it, I felt like \u2014 it was almost like I was finally committed to something. It was something that was a little difficult. And any time something is difficult, you appreciate it more when you succeed or you master it, I guess. So in that sense, it was an accomplishment. And from now on, I\u2019ll never forget those words. Once you commit something to memory, even if you don\u2019t say it for a long time, it\u2019s always there. And I feel like, no matter what, I can always pray and use those words to have peace and inner calm. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, stories, memories, and musings from Ramadan. My name is Maria Enriqueta Romero. Maria is Mexican-American, a lawyer, and a single mother. She grew up Roman Catholic and married an Arab-Muslim man. Only after their divorce did she convert to Islam. I think the most difficult Ramadan was \u2014 I hadn\u2019t converted to Islam yet, but I was \u201Cstudying\u201D Islam, so that Ramadan came around and I was fasting. And my mother was quite opposed to me coming to Islam. \u201CWhy didn\u2019t you come to Islam while you were married to this person? That I could understand. I can\u2019t understand you doing it on your own.\u201D In years past, in order to support him, I would fast with him during Ramadan even though I wasn\u2019t a Muslim. And the year we got married, Ramadan and Lent fell around the same time. I had told him, \u201COK, I\u2019ll fast with you, but on Fridays, we have to break our fast with fish because I can\u2019t have meat on Fridays.\u201D But things get better. Last year, we opened our home to single and convert Muslim females because I know what it\u2019s like to not have a tradition, a family gathering in your home, and specific particular meals for Ramadan. And last year was the first year that I felt I had a home large enough where I could welcome someone and that I had the financial resources to be able to say, \u201CYou\u2019re welcome in our home. I may not know you, but you\u2019re a convert or you\u2019re a single sister, and I don\u2019t want you to be alone for at least one night.\u201D We would do it on Wednesdays. We\u2019re not having it in my home this year, but we\u2019re having it in cabanas because they\u2019re larger, because we hope to have more women. Ibrahim Al-Marashi grew up Iraqi-American in northern California. Now a scholar of modern history with a focus on the Middle East, he\u2019s taught in the U.S., Turkey, and Spain. I was studying as an undergrad at UCLA. And I remember that, during the day, a fellow Iraqi-Muslim, who doesn\u2019t practice the faith \u2014 she knew I was fasting, yet she was still eating an ice cream in my face to kind of taunt my practice of my religious belief at the university. And I remember that moment because, usually when you think about Muslims, you think of this one monolithic block who\u2019s engaged in kind of these Islamic rituals without any kind of deviation, yet I still remember this girl eating her Baskin-Robbins ice cream in the classroom. At the same time, there was a Jewish person in the class, a Jew from Iran. He also had an ice cream. It was a very hot day. He knew I was fasting, and he walked out of the classroom. It just goes to show me that you have this kind of image of Judaism and Islam locked in this kind of intractable conflict. Yet it\u2019s those kind of daily moments that \u2014 here is a Jew from Iran more considerate of my religious beliefs than a fellow Iraqi-Muslim. That kind of reminded me that it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are. You can be sensitive to other peoples\u2019 beliefs. One of the interests I have, particularly living in Islamic Spain, is this kind of interplay of this kind of harmony in Jewish-Muslim relations as well as what \u2014 the Spanish term \u2014 the \u201Cconvivencia,\u201D the ability of Spaniards, Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike to live together. This is one of the areas I find that\u2019s fascinating to research. And I often remember that Ramadan incident when I\u2019m reading various books and sources on the subject. My name is Sahar Ullah. Sahar comes from a Bengali family. She is a PhD candidate at Columbia University in New York City where she studies and teaches literature, but she spoke with us from her home in South Florida. I have a lot of stories. The first Ramadan that I actually fasted the entire month, I happened to be in sixth grade. I was really excited. \u201CI\u2019m gonna do this. I\u2019m gonna be like an adult, and I\u2019m gonna fast the entire month.\u201D Ramadan, in the States especially, is always marked by Muslims debating whether the moon was sighted and whether today is the day or the next day is actually the first day of Ramadan. But anyway, the first day of Ramadan happened to be on the day of the first field trip of the year. And I was so excited about this field trip because we\u2019d get to go to McDonald\u2019s for lunch and we didn\u2019t have to bring our bag lunches. When I found out that Ramadan was starting on the day of the field trip, I was so mad. And then I thought to myself, \u201CI should be a really good spiritual person and consider this as part of the struggle, the struggle of being Muslim.\u201D And of course, my friends \u2014 they didn\u2019t make it any easier. So when we went to McDonald\u2019s and everybody ordered their meals, I just sat there staring at them. And I remember one of my friends \u2014 she kept eating her fries really slowly in front of me and telling me, \u201CMmm, don\u2019t you want some fries? Don\u2019t you wish you could eat these?\u201D And I kept saying, \u201CNo, I\u2019m fasting, I\u2019m fasting. I can\u2019t eat them.\u201D And then maybe half an hour later, before we were about to leave, the manager came up and she is like, \u201CI\u2019m looking for a young lady in a plaid shirt.\u201D And she saw me, and she said, \u201CWell, this is for you. There\u2019s two gentlemen who wanted me to give this to you.\u201D There were two big meals with a burger and fries and drinks. [laughs] I remember those two men. They were looking at us because all of my friends were teasing me. And they were wearing scrubs, so they looked like they were either med students or physicians. And they must have thought: one, that I was poor, and I didn\u2019t have the money to get food and I was too proud to ask anyone else for food, or that I was starving myself and I was just another girl with some kind of eating disorder. But anyway, it was a really nice gesture. But at the same time, I couldn\u2019t eat it. There was still four hours left for breaking the fast. So I gave away the burgers, and I gave away the drinks, and I broke my fast with the fries on my first Ramadan. That\u2019s always a memory I turn to and laugh about, speaking of being Muslim in America. My name is Mary Hope Schwoebel. Mary was raised Presbyterian. With the social justice movements of the 1960s, her parents became more secular and so did she. But that changed when she met the man who would become her husband, a Somali Muslim. When he proposed, I actually volunteered. He didn\u2019t ask me to convert. Because, as you know, Islam enables men to marry women of the book. In other words, Jews and Christians don\u2019t have to convert. It\u2019s acceptable for a Muslim man to marry them. And it was easy for me to convert because Islam is so logical. And he impressed me in a million ways. He wasn\u2019t a feminist. He\u2019s not a feminist still. He would never call himself a feminist. And yet, I think, because of his Muslim beliefs, he had more fundamental respect for women than anybody I had ever met. So, in some ways, I felt like he was more of a feminist in practice than anybody I\u2019d met who called themselves a feminist. During a past Ramadan, at my children\u2019s school, they were into diversity training and this, that, and the other. They were in middle school, and it was post-9/11. 9/11 happened when they were in middle school, so schools were making an extra effort, particularly in Fairfax County where it\u2019s very diverse. And there was a little girl, a Somali girl, who got up to speak. And she was a good friend of my daughter\u2019s. My daughter never covered her head, but this little girl does cover her head. She was asked to explain Ramadan, and it was to parents and students both. And she explained about how Ramadan makes you humble, how it instills humility, and also how it makes you compassionate. Because when you are hungry, you understand the experience of those people who are hungry every day of their lives. And that was actually a real teaching moment for me. I had never thought about it that way. And I think it was so meaningful to me because it resonated so much with my work. Because I do work in international conflict zones and in third world countries where people are, in fact, hungry and in development and whatnot. To me, integration is very important and that my work reflect my beliefs. And my religion is really important to me. And so when she told me that, that was one of those ah-ha moments I guess you can call it. My name is Adnan. Although I am Turkish, my name is Arabic after my great-grandfather\u2019s name. And right after the 9/11, this name, Adnan, has been on the most-wanted list of FBI. And so there\u2019s a certain association in peoples\u2019 mind. And hearing Adnan, people are getting a little concerned, maybe. Adnan Onart lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is an active Muslim member of a Unitarian Universalist congregation. We finish this first half of our program with a poem, \u201CRamadan in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts,\u201D which Adnan wrote and read for us. \u201CRamadan in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u201D From his asking about the time and double-checking his watch, I understood: he was about to break his fast. Selam\u00FCn Aleyk\u00FCm, I said, the only Arabic I knew for all practical purposes. Aleyk\u00FCm Selam, he replied. He was setting his table: two donuts, one Chocolate Glazed, the other Boston Kreme and a thick lentil soup he had apparently brought from the grocery store across the street. Do you want to sit down and share? I thanked him, no. Aren\u2019t you fasting? I explained: my high blood pressure, my medication. He pointed to one of the donuts: Still, he said, let\u2019s share. The collapsing Twin Towers, the beheaded hostages, and the jumpy look on people\u2019s faces hearing my name. We already do, I said. Poetry was Adnan Onart\u2019s response to our invitation for expressions of Muslim identity. He first submitted \u201CMorning Prayer,\u201D which he wrote as he was coming out of a deep depression. You can read and listen to four of his poems, including \u201CRamadan in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts,\u201D and hear more stories from our \u201C30 Days of Ramadan\u201D playlist at onbeing.org. Coming up, Ramadan on a shop floor in the garment district of New York; Ramadan sermons in Texas devoted to domestic violence; Ramadan in Manchester, England; Ramadan and Rumi. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. We\u2019re exploring the delights and the gravity of Ramadan, Islam\u2019s holiest month. Ramadan commemorates the revelation of the earliest verses of the Qur\u2019an to the Prophet Mohammed. It shifts along the Western calendar across time, according to cycles of the moon, and depending on the lunar cycles of any given year, it is either 29 or 30 days long. We invited Muslims to tell us what it means to observe Ramadan today, in spiritual terms and in their everyday lives. They range in age from their teens to their 70s. Together, they embody the multiplicity and singularity \u2014 as one put it \u2014 of this tradition of nearly 2 billion people. My name is Feruze Faison. I am from Turkey, and I\u2019ve been living in the United States in New York City for the past 20-something years. After an early marriage in the U.S., Feruze met the love of her life, who happened to be a woman. This is a source of estrangement between her and her family. Her Islamic sensibility is deeply influenced by the Sufi poetry of Rumi. Fasting is a very interesting experience. The fact that \u2014 first of all, it teaches you that you can do so much more than you think you can. It could be 90 degrees and on a regular day when you don\u2019t have to fast \u2014 you can\u2019t go without drinking water more than an hour. But during Ramadan, for some reason, you can. You can go the whole day. And at the end of the day, when you take that first sip of water, it is the sweetest thing in the world. That accomplishment \u2014 that, \u201CWow, I can actually do this\u201D \u2014 that was always a big deal for me, even as a young child. Even though I didn\u2019t do the whole month, but I did a day here, a day there. I was like, \u201CWow, I could actually do this. If I can do this, God knows what else I can do.\u201D And fasting clears my mind. I can only talk for myself, but I feel that I could really concentrate more, and I could meditate much deeper. And the reason for this, as I read from an author from Turkey, Ahmed Hulusi \u2014 he explains it. He says when you\u2019re not fasting, a lot of your blood and a lot of your bodily energy is around your intestines, your stomach, so your brain loses out on a lot of energy. But once you stop input to the stomach, now your body can really heal other parts. And the brain can take as much energy as it needs and wants. So your thought is much clearer. And your understanding \u2014 when you read and you meditate, you understand much more. My name is Tayyaba Syed. I am from Glendale Heights, Illinois. I substitute at various Islamic schools when I have time. And other than that, I am a stay-at-home mom, and I\u2019m helping take care of my parents throughout the week. Tayyaba is a mother of three. \u201CIn my faith,\u201D she wrote to us, \u201Cparents are highly regarded. We have to honor and respect them unreservedly and treat them with utter kindness.\u201D Her Ramadan story revolves around her father, who passed away a few months after she spoke with us. I do remember watching my parents and my older siblings fasting as a younger child and wanting to be able to fast, too, because it\u2019s such a big part of our faith. And I think I was maybe nine or 10 years old. Kids do not have to fast until after puberty or once you\u2019ve entered puberty. I woke up \u2014 we have to eat before the sun comes up in the morning. So I woke up, and I\u2019d had some breakfast. And I think around nine, 10 o\u2019clock, I told my father \u2014 I was like, \u201CI think I can do this. I think I can continue the rest of the fast.\u201D And he was so concerned. He was like, \u201CNo, no, no. You\u2019re too little. You do not need to fast. It\u2019s not obligatory on you. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201D And I was like, \u201CNo, Dad, I can do it. Just let me try. Just let me get through the rest of the day.\u201D He\u2019s like, \u201CLet\u2019s take baby steps. You woke up, that\u2019s a big thing. You had breakfast with us. That\u2019s a big thing. Maybe next year, you can fast for half the day.\u201D I remember he was like, \u201CHere, drink this water and break your fast.\u201D I was so devastated. I was so disappointed. But when I was able to fast, it was a great big deal. A child\u2019s first fast is a big deal in our faith. But, yeah, that\u2019s one of the first memories I have of Ramadan. It\u2019s a beautiful month of spirituality and unity and family and community coming together. A lot of time is spent in the mosque in prayer and reading the Qur\u2019an. I love it. I\u2019m really excited about the month. My name is Allee Ramadhan, and I\u2019m from Derwood, Maryland. I was born as a Muslim here in America more than 65 years ago, and I did not stress that fact in my life as a child. Allee is the father of 11 children and a retired federal prosecutor. Well, first off, my faith, what I enjoy about it and what I have always treasured about it, is that I saw it as a personal faith. In other words, there was nothing between me and my God. And so it allowed me to interpret certain things. It allowed me a greater freedom in my understanding of my God. So as I try to practice my faith in praying five times a day, it constantly, in a sense, keeps me \u2014 as a reminder and in contact with my faith and my God. And therefore, I try to remain humble. I think it helps me to remain humble. When you remain humble in a world, you approach people in a kind of a quality. It manifests itself in everything I do. Because I am a diabetic, I don\u2019t fast during the month of Ramadan. I know the month of Ramadan is a time of discipline, but I don\u2019t see fasting, and I don\u2019t see it as something that God wanted us to put our lives in danger on. There are other ways that I try to celebrate the month. I try to be a little more generous than I normally am. So I try to compensate in other ways. My name\u2019s Ilana Alazzeh. My father, who\u2019s Palestinian, lives in San Francisco. And my mother\u2019s actually Israeli-American, who converted to Islam. And my stepfather is Pakistani. So I have a really mixed family, and we have really mixed heritage. Ilana shared many stories with us, but for her, it\u2019s her family\u2019s religious diversity that illustrates a quintessential aspect of being Muslim in the United States. My grandfather, who is a staunch Israeli veteran and was a Palmach war veteran, he was kind of uncomfortable with the idea of my mother being Muslim for a long time. And he still is. But that never stopped him from kind of respecting when I was fasting. For instance, one of my brothers was teasing me and eating food in front of me while I was fasting. And he kind of gives him a clap and was like, \u201CStop being a schmuck,\u201D basically. And I was kind of surprised by that. It was kind of that interesting juxtaposition when you compare it to the culture I was raised in, very Israeli and but also very Muslim at the same time. My father\u2019s family is very Palestinian, I would say. We come from \u2014 Alazzeh family has a long tradition of tribes and rulers over in Palestine. So it was just interesting to have that juxtaposition. Ramadan usually comes at different parts of the season, depending on what year you\u2019re talking about. Because it\u2019s based on the moon calendar, I remember one time it came upon, I\u2019d say, Christmas time. And there were so many lights outside. I remember my mom was visiting a friend who\u2019s actually a convert from Christianity. And we all piled in the car, my grandfather, my mother, even my step-grandmother at the time who converted \u2014 she\u2019s actually African-American. She was originally southern Baptist but converted to Judaism in order to marry my grandfather. And I remember we went out to go see the lights during this one Ramadan night. And we started singing these Christmas songs, and by the end of it, we were also singing these Jewish songs. It was just \u2014 during Ramadan \u2014 a majority of people in the car were Muslim. So we were just like a whole bunch of puzzle pieces. Kind of odd ones, I suppose. My name is Nadia Sheikh Bandukda. I live near Princeton, New Jersey. My father was born and raised in Kenya, moved to England, came to America, sounded just like me or any other Joe. And my mom was from Pakistan, came over when she was 15, but still sounds like she just moved over. Nadia is an attorney who specializes in labor and employment issues. Her Ramadan memory takes place in the garment district of New York City, in a household goods store owned by her father. After he came back from England, he opened up a small retail store. And it was a largely Jewish-populated district, and it\u2019s a largely Jewish-populated kind of business as well. My father\u2019s business partner was a man named Isaac Cohen, and he broke the fast with us almost every time I visited the store with my dad. We would just sit around. The security guards were African descent. The cashiers were from Southeast Asia. The women on the floor that helped customers with certain questions were Hispanic. You know \u2014 exactly kind of the microcosm of what New York is in this small retail store with about 40 employees. And at the time to break fast, you would see the people behind the register just kind of eating and breaking the fast and us going around with trays, me and my sisters going around with trays giving dates to everyone in the store. Sometimes customers would be like, \u201COh, do you sell these in the store?\u201D \u201CNo, we\u2019re breaking the fast. Would you like one?\u201D And they would eat it, and it would be interesting, and they would ask where it was sold. It was not about the eating. It was about sharing. It was nice. It was just the whole experience. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CRevealing Ramadan.\u201D Longer versions of the stories you\u2019ve heard thus far and many others are available for download on our website. Find them and our \u201C30 Days of Ramadan playlist\u201D at onbeing.org. When I first started the transition from party girl to \u201CI\u2019m going to wear a hijab and devote myself to God,\u201D it was definitely a rough transition. There\u2019s a lot that you have to learn if you want to really take another religion into your heart. Nicole Queen was born in Houston and raised Southern Baptist. Out of college, she worked as a photographer covering celebrities and nightlife. As she grew disillusioned with that lifestyle, she became intrigued with the ideas and preaching of Yusuf Estes, a fellow Protestant Christian Texan who converted to Islam nearly three decades ago. Now in her 30s, Nicole is a practicing Muslim, as is her husband and his family. I started to fast the month of Ramadan two years before I actually converted to Islam because I used to think it was just a pretty cool thing. Like people said, \u201CYou know what? This month I\u2019m not going to eat or drink anything until the sun goes down.\u201D And that kind of makes you all equal. Everybody is hungry, everybody is thirsty, and it also humbles you. It teaches you what it\u2019s like for the people who don\u2019t have access to all the food and water that we have. So I would fast on my own or with a couple of friends. I would fast through the month, and it felt great. I remember my first year to fast Ramadan as a Muslim, I thought, \u201COh, I\u2019ve done this before.\u201D But when you fast as a Muslim \u2014 I remember it was just a completely different feeling. You feel like you\u2019re glowing the whole month. And it\u2019s a really tough thing to do because, when you fast as a Muslim, you\u2019re not just fasting. You have lots of extra praying and everything. Your intentions the whole time are about worship and about what you\u2019re offering to God and your sacrificing that you\u2019re making. And you get together with other families. When you first become a Muslim, you just feel kind of alone, like as a convert. You feel kind of alone because you\u2019re a convert to them, and to your family, you\u2019re pretty rebellious. You\u2019re being really different. So I remember, that first Ramadan, I really felt like I had a place with people. I had a home with them, and I had a place with my in-laws. So I think that that first Ramadan was when I actually started to feel like I belonged to one group or the other. It really was kind of a special moment for me in that. My name is Sabiha Shariff and I was born in Bombay, India, now known as Mumbai. We\u2019ve been here \u2014 we migrated to this country in 1982. For most of her life in the U.S., Sabiha lived in New Jersey, where she worked in the corporate world. Now retired and living in Dallas, she volunteers with the Texas Muslim Women\u2019s Foundation. As she tells her Ramadan story, she uses the Arabic word for mosque, \u201Cmasjid.\u201D There is this organization that I\u2019m a member of. It\u2019s called the Texas Muslim Women\u2019s Foundation. Last Ramadan, they had a domestic violence awareness day in all the masjids in the Metroplex at the same day, which was the second Friday of Ramadan. That clearly comes to my mind because it was every \u2014 on Fridays, they have a sermon which is called the hutba \u2014 every Friday. That particular Friday, which was the second Friday of Ramadan, this organization requested all the masjids in the Metroplex to give a hutba pertaining to domestic violence. I think that it was really beautiful because it drew the awareness that there\u2019s a lot of domestic abuse going on in families here, and it brought the awareness to the general public. I thought it was great because the same thought, the same message, was relayed throughout the Metroplex area on one single Friday. And it was done in the holy month, so that \u2014 I think people are more aware during this month because of zakat, the obligatory charity that they have to do is mostly encouraged in the month of Ramadan. People just open their hearts and their wallets, and there are so many causes that come up in the masjids. So many people come and ask for funds, and people just give and give, no matter what their financial status. That, I think, is one of the beautiful things in Ramadan. My name is Steven Longden. I\u2019m from Manchester, which is in the north of England. So this year, at the start of Ramadan, which you need to appreciate that the Islamic day starts at sundown as with the Jewish faith \u2014 so at the start of Ramadan this year, it was about half past eight in the evening. So we\u2019re all wishing each other a happy Ramadan in the family and our neighbors and sending emails and texts and telephone calls. And obviously, the children do that with all their grandparents and friends. It\u2019s an exciting time, as you can imagine, for everybody in the family. Steven converted to Islam in 1990. The whole of the Qur\u2019an divided into 30 parts is read in Muslim congregations and families across the month of Ramadan. We close this hour with Steven\u2019s reading of a passage from the Qur\u2019an that expresses the essence of faith and of Ramadan for him. Now you\u2019ll have to forgive me because we\u2019re fasting, and my throat is a little dry. So forgive me if it sounds a little bit raspy. I\u2019m going to recite a chapter of the Qur\u2019an which comes toward the end of the Qur\u2019an. It\u2019s one of the short chapters, and it\u2019s called, in Arabic, \u201CSurat al-\u2018Asr\u201D \u2014 the chapter\u2019s name is \u201CTime.\u201D So here goes: So that was my little effort reciting the Qur\u2019an. In English, I\u2019ll translate that. So we start every chapter with \u201CBismillah al rahman al rahim,\u201D which means, \u201CIn the name of Allah, the most mystical, the most kind.\u201D \u201CWith regards to time, surely humankind is at a loss except those who believe, and do good deeds, and are steadfast in truths, and are steadfast with patience.\u201D And that\u2019s it. This show came about while we were listening for stories about living Islam, and nearly every person had a defining, sparkling Ramadan memory to share.
