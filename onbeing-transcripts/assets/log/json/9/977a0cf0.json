  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Power of Fundamentalism. \u201CViolent religious fundamentalism is one of the great threats confronting the modern world. Fundamentalism has a different history and expression in every religious tradition. The dictionary defines it as \u201Ca movement or attitude stressing strict adherence to a set of basic principles.\u201D But that does not begin to describe the power of this way of seeing the world, nor its potential to motivate and to destroy. This hour we\u2019ll hear why some people became fundamentalists, what drew them out of it and what we might learn from the fundamentalist impulse at this time. We\u2019ll speak with three men. They are Muslim, Christian and Jewish \u2014 a lawyer, a seminary president and a journalist. Each of them has remained deeply religious while defining the foundations of their faith. When these men criticize fundamentalism, they\u2019re not describing someone else. They\u2019re speaking about themselves, their families of origin, their childhood friends. It\u2019s a form of intoxication and I grew out of it, but in the case of these kids and the \u2014 our kids, most of them never live long enough to outgrow it. Their lives are tragically short and tragically delusional. When Khaled Abou El Fadl refers to `these kids,\u2019 he\u2019s also speaking of his own early years, a life he narrowly escaped. Today he is a leading international authority in Islamic law and human rights with degrees from Yale and Princeton. He\u2019s a professor of law at UCLA, but he grew up in a middle-class family in Kuwait and Egypt, and he was a Muslim fundamentalist by the time he reached seventh grade. Khaled Abou El Fadl compares the kinds of young people who join Muslim fundamentalist groups across the world with the kinds of young people who join gangs in cities in this country. The main difference is that in the Islamic context, you\u2019ve got to add a civilizational component. Normally, you know, a kid coming from a certain area of LA who decides to join a gang \u2014 he\u2019s not thinking about changing the world. Even a Christian fundamentalist in the United States who joins a Christian group is not thinking in those terms. But those kids, they \u2014 they grow up with numerous mythologies about the greatness of the past and they look at their present, and the present is remarkably miserable at many different fronts. Tell me how that was real and concrete for you. As an Egyptian, it becomes very concrete when you think everywhere you turn the \u2014 the identity to which you belong is confronted with military defeats. If you travel \u2014 you carry an Egyptian passport and you try to travel all around the world, you become thrown into a category of the inferior just by virtue of the fact that you belong to an Arab identity. And I remember, you know, going through a stage where I tried the \u2014 the sort of cool route of being Westernized. That, for me, didn\u2019t work, and what did work was that \u2014 that exultation, intoxication, remarkable high of finding a group of people that tell you, `You know what? You\u2019re better than the Americans. You\u2019re better than the British. You\u2019re better than the Arabs. You\u2019re better than the church. You\u2019re better than anyone because you\u2019re Muslim and all you have to do is just simply accept our version of orthodoxy.\u2019 And I remember, as a teenager, suddenly I would walk around with my head high. I belonged to something very powerful. And I could see the world as black and white, evil and good, and I was on the side \u2014 in fact, not just on the side of good \u2013 Anyone who wants to achieve goodness has to come through me. You know, they \u2014 they have to get my approval\u2026 That\u2019s the ultimate power, right. \u2026so that was the high. That\u2019s the intoxication. Fortunately, I grew out of it. Unfortunately, many of these kids never get that chance. A section of the song \u201CJihad\u201D by the Muslim rappers Soldiers of Allah. Khaled Abou El Fadl is quick to note that there are versions of Islamic fundamentalism which are not violent. They may condemn the beliefs of others, but they leave judgment up to God. He uses the word `supremacist\u2019 or `puritan\u2019 to describe the militant Saudi Arabian Wahhabi brand of Islam to which he once adhered and which we now associate with al-Qaeda. Egyptian-born, Khaled Abou El Fadl is frequently called upon to analyze the theology of Islamic terrorism, and he cautions that social and political developments since the 1980s have left many young people in the Islamic world vulnerable to Wahhabi influence whether they and their families are extremist or not. In this theology, truth is unequivocally identifiable. It is identifiable. It is identifiable. Not only is there a truth, but that this truth is attainable on this earth. Furthermore, the perfection of God is attainable on this earth. Third is that discussion, discourse, philosophy, history \u2014 all of that is either an aberration or sophistry. I learned very early on during this phase that philosophy is the science of the devil. The devil invented philosophy in order to lead peo \u2014 people astray. Intellectuals exist basically to confuse people. History, other than the his \u2014 other than the time period of the prophet and his companions, which is highly idealized \u2014 the rest of history is basically an aberration. And \u2014 and so this identifiable truth is located, then, in a literal reading of the Qur\u2019an? Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re taught. I mean, that\u2019s what you are taught. And of course, you know, most of these kids, the honest truth is they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re not very educated or even if they \u2014 if they are, their education is mostly in the sciences. When I started getting some education, everything that I was taught appeared to have been just a complete, remarkable fantasy and lie. I mean, one of the things I can tell you as \u2014 sort of as a matter of testimony is that the majority of kids who shared this view at that time had never read the Qur\u2019an for themselves. And I remember that one of the teachers used to say that it\u2019s a sin to read the Qur\u2019an directly because the devil will play with your intellect. You have to read it through your teacher \u2014 i.e., him. You know, that \u2014 that really helps me because in the bit that I know of the Qur\u2019an and have read of the Qur\u2019an, it strikes me that this is also true of the Christian Bible. You c \u2014 you can\u2019t really take every line literally because there is a lot of contradictory teaching in there, or there\u2019s a lot of nuance that \u2014 that \u2014 that has to condition your understanding of the text if you really are taking it seriously. Absolutely. And, in fact, one of the things that, you know, started giving me very serious doubts is that there is this sort of effect of \u2014 of eradication and destruction of your intellectual capacities. My father wou \u2014 told me back then, `Have you noticed that since you\u2019ve gone on this thing that your \u2014 even your vocabulary has deteriorated.\u2019 So I can\u2019t open my mouth without throwing out some type of cliche that everyone in \u2014 in \u2014 in the mosque who attended these classes would be repeating. In the West when we look at the root sources of terrorism, we tend to think first of poverty. And \u2014 and I have no idea from \u2014 from the life you\u2019re describing what the economic situation was of you or the people around you, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sensing that you feel that that was as much a factor as the life of the mind and how that was oppressed. I absolutely would \u2014 would agree with that. I mean, I think poverty does play some role, but it is not in my own \u2014 at least in my experience in my own \u2014 my view, it was not the main thing. The main thing was the social turmoil and the lack of an intellectual life. Every day you read the \u2014 the newspapers, the \u2014 and the government-sponsored newspapers, and they all said the same thing. And, you know, the \u2014 you turn on the TV, the television, and it \u2014 there\u2019s again, nothing there. There are no honest, straightforward discussions about anything. You know, basically it\u2019s either how wonderful the government is, or it\u2019s American movies that entice you with a life that you will \u2014 you can never have. So in that atmosphere, the feeling that I remember very distinctly is that I would just feel suffocated. Right before I started, you know, attending the \u2014 the classes of these guys, day in and day out I would wake up and go to bed, and always I would tell my mother and father, you know, `What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point of this life?\u2019 Islamic scholar and law professor, Khaled Abou El Fadl. We\u2019re talking about the power of religious fundamentalism. At the age of 15, with his father\u2019s help, Khaled Abou El Fadl discovered Islamic jurisprudence, a body of Islamic thought that opened his heart and mind. This tradition with ancient roots debates how the Qur\u2019an might apply to every aspect of life. It is something like the Jewish Talmud. Jurisprudence gave Khaled Abou El Fadl a life-changing alternative to fundamentalism, and he believes that it is the best hope for Islam today, a counterweight to the simplifications used by terrorists. The more I delved into the Islamic jurisprudence and how humble it was, how these medieval jurists, how remarkably humble they talk \u2014 they would never say, `God \u2014 God\u2019s law is\u2019; they would always say, `In my view, God\u2019s law is \u2014 and God knows better.\u2019 Right. I mean, humility is not a term that we would associate with some of these more terrifying images \u2014 Islamic images we\u2019ve had in the last months. Far from it. To me there was a little bit of even a \u2014 I have to admit like a post-traumatic reaction as I watched bin Laden speak after 9/11. In the videotape? Yeah, on Al-Jazeera channel. You know, I \u2014 I listened to it in Arabic, of course, and the \u2014 you know, the smugness, the arrogance, the \u2014 the \u2014 the complete obliviousness to the other and the suffering of the other and the pain of the other \u2014 at one point I had a physical reaction where I started feeling my body hurting because at the time that I had informed these \u2014 these guys that I was no longer going to attend their classes, I\u2019m going to attend the class of the real jurists\u2026 This is when you were a teen-ager in Egypt. Yeah, I think I was, like, 15 at the time. I was beaten, quite savagely, and you know, all the \u2014 the \u2014 the friendship of the past, you know, meant nothing overnight. And just watching bin Laden with his smugness and his arrogance put me back in that scary moment. But in my case, that beating \u2014 and there were several other after that \u2014 only sparked the \u2014 the defiance in me. I vowed and continued to vow never to \u2014 to shut up and to just stand up to this type of what I consider to be blasphemy against the Islamic tradition and the \u2014 what I consider to be a very beautiful and humanistic tradition. There\u2019s a Jewish writer and journalist, Yossi Klein Halevi, who\u2019s written a book about a journey of worshiping with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land, and he wrote Islam had a genius for fearlessness. The dark side was the suicide bombers, but he \u2014 he also saw a great strength. And \u2014 and \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s also a quality that I hear coming through in \u2014 in your voice and in your story. I mean, what is the theological root of \u2014 of this fearlessness in Islam? Well, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re sort of going to laugh. It\u2019s actually \u2014 goes back to the theology of jihad. I mean, jihad means to struggle, right? I mean, it doesn\u2019t mean holy war; it means to struggle and to stand for what you believe and to stand with friends and to trust that your reward at the end for doing what you do is with God. And what I am doing, I believe, is jihad. What \u2014 by writing my books and by lecturing and by speaking out \u2014 I believe is jihad, and I believe that if someone decides to kill me because of this, I believe I die as a martyr.

After a short break, we\u2019ll explore Protestant fundamentalism and Jewish extremism through the stories of Christian philosopher Richard Mouw and Israeli journalist Yossi Klein Halevi. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Each week we focus on a different theme, asking how human experience shapes religious ideas. Today, we\u2019re exploring the danger and attraction of religious fundamentalism. What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule, if, in fact \u2014 if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve. These were the controversial remarks made on national television two days after the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks by the Reverend Jerry Falwell, pastor of a 22,000-member fundamentalist Baptist church, and one of America\u2019s most outspoken conservative Christians. I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way \u2014 all of them who\u2019ve tried to secularize America \u2014 I point the finger in their face and say, `You helped this happen.\u2019 Jerry Falwell later apologized, but for some, like Richard Mouw, his remarks exposed the worst of modern Christian fundamentalism. Richard Mouw is the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, one of the world\u2019s leading centers of evangelical scholarship. And he grew up in a fundamentalist home. My dad had had a profound religious conversion one night when he was asked to perform. He was a hillbilly band musician, and he preached on street corners and he spoke in rescue missions, and he became a minister in a Dutch Reformed denomination, but he never really lost that initial fundamentalist way of viewing things. And by that, I mean he always had a kind of hostility toward anything that was associated with protestant liberalism. We were raised in a context where we were kind of anti-Catholic. We \u2014 we tended to think of the pope, if \u2014 if not as the Antichrist, as a good friend of the Antichrist. Richard Mouw traces the origins of modern fundamentalism to the turn of the 20th century, when liberal protestant theologians began to embrace critical methods of studying the Bible. Most disturbing for some of the faithful, like his father, was a tendency to dismiss the supernatural power of God. And so they began to stress the importance of the fundamentals. The fundamentals were generally acknowledged to be a list of this sort \u2014 that \u2014 it\u2019s people who believe that the Bible is the authoritative word of God \u2014 they have \u2014 it\u2019s a high view of Scripture, and so it\u2019s the presupposition that you bring to the Bible as \u2014 as authoritative word from God. You believe that Jesus wasn\u2019t just the great human teacher but that he was God incarnate, the son of God, that he was born of a virgin, that his death on the cross was a substitutionary atoning death, you know, that \u2014 that what happened on the cross somehow brought about \u2014 in some mysterious way it brought about our salvation in a way that nothing else could have done. And it\u2019s the belief that he\u2019s going to come again, that \u2014 that the world has not seen the last of Jesus. Fundamentalists also have an intense interest in Bible prophecy. I mean, the \u2014 the word `literal\u2019 and `literalist\u2019 are really misapplied to fundamentalists because they play around a lot with the symbols of the Scriptures\u2026 Right. \u2026you know, the beasts of the book of Revelation. And they\u2019ll ask the question, `Who does that stand for?\u2019 And so they see that as a revelation in a kind of coded form that imparts genuine information about things that are going on in our own world. So talk to me about the experiences, you know, the most vivid memories you have of growing up in that kind of context. Well, for one thing, there was a vast network of \u2014 of institutions and organizations. There was, of course, the local church, but we had summer Bible conferences, we had youth organizations like Youth for Christ and Young Life, and later on, you know, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and Campus Crusade. We had evangelistic crusades of the sort that, you know, Billy Graham made very famous. But there were a lot of evangelists that came through town. So it was a \u2014 being a fundamentalist was a very busy thing. You \u2014 you-you got to do a lot of things. Why? I mean, is there a theological underpinning of that? Well, because fundamentalists were very concerned about conversion and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were very open to creating organizations that targeted, that reached out to different groups of people who needed to be converted, and so they placed, like, a big emphasis on evangelizing young people, and you get these marvelously complex networks of organizations. And \u2014 and they had radio program \u2014 the seminary that I head up was started by Charles E. Fuller, radio evangelist in the 1930s and \u201940s and \u201950s who pioneered in religious broadcasting, one of the first international radio broadcasts. And every week he did his radio program and his wife was there, and she read the letters from people, and to this day I get people who come up to me, `I can still remember Mrs. Fuller reading the letters on \u2014 on the radio.\u2019 And they had these gospel songs. They had wonderful choirs and quartets. In many ways, the fundamentalists who were very much against some of the more visible manifestations of popular culture \u2014 you\u2019ve got to remember, these are people who did not go to the movies, they did not dance, they did not drink, smoke, they didn\u2019t play pool, they didn\u2019t play cards. They had all of this list of negatives. And they\u2019re very well-known for things that they cannot do, and there you can find a lot of common ground with \u2014 oh, Hasidic Judaism and the more fundamentalist kind of Islam. But because they \u2014 they didn\u2019t go the movies or they didn\u2019t go to dances on Saturday night, they created their own rather vital forms of, as it were, religious entertainment. Mr. Charles E. Fuller: (From vintage radio programming) And now Mrs. Fuller\u2019s going to read to you from some of the letters, if I can find her here in the studio. Where are you, honey? Here. Come on. Right here. Right here. Right here. All right. Come on. Oh, good evening, friends. Here is a good letter from San Francisco. `Mr. Fuller, I was talking to a young man who told me he found the Lord through hearing your message over the radio. While staying home to take care of his brothers and sisters, he would turn on the radio\u2026 I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. We\u2019re talking today about the power of fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. My guest, Richard Mouw, grew up in a fundamentalist home and is now a Christian philosopher. Richard Mouw began to question his fundamentalist upbringing when he became caught up in the political movements of the 1960s. He became a passionate advocate for civil rights, an opponent of the Vietnam War and an organizer in the radical left-wing SDS while a graduate student. In recent years, he\u2019s doing a great deal of thinking and writing about what the fundamentalist impulse reveals of human nature and what it has contributed to American culture. And with some irony, he traces those insights directly back to his religious political activism of the 1960s. It was a fascinating experience because I was firmly committed to the anti-war cause and also the civil rights movement, just to take, you know, two prominent movements of the \u201960s. And yet one of the things that \u2014 that struck me sitting in those endless participatory democracy anti-war protest discussion groups was that the passion of many of the young radicals was not unlike the passion of fundamentalism. And in my experience, as I left fundamentalism \u2014 and I left it behind for, oh, the three reasons that I talk about a lot in my book \u2014 it was very anti-intellectual and I could not live with that as I began to study and became interested in the intellectual quest, the scholarly life. It was very other-worldly; fundamentalists were not very interested in doing anything about issues of social justice or peace or \u2014 or righteousness in the larger world. And the other was a kind of separatistic spirit, a willingness to refuse to cooperate with any other Christians even if \u2014 if you disagreed with them, even on some minor point of \u2014 of doctrine. But, you know, it\u2019s very interesting. In the civil rights movement, hymns were very important to the spirit of that movement. Right. \u201CWe Shall Overcome.\u201D That\u2019s right. And for me in many of those situations, as I was struggling, for example, as a person in my \u2014 my 20s with whether or not I was going to answer the \u2014 the draft call and \u2014 and be enlisted in the armed forces and possibly go to Vietnam, and I believed, and I still believe, that it was an unjust war, and I could not go, even though I wasn\u2019t a pacifist and I \u2014 it looked like maybe I was going to have to go to jail. And people in my family and in my larger fundamentalist evangelical network were very critical of me, and it was a very lonely time for me spiritually and \u2014 and religiously because I felt cut off from my \u2014 from my roots. But what was interesting was that in all of that civil rights and anti-war stuff, the \u2014 the \u2014 the things that sustained me were those hymns. Even when you did not perceive yourself to be nearly as religious. Yeah, in those revival meetings, those hymns actually had a very radical scope and a radical tone to them; you know, `I surrender all,\u2019 and `Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?\u2019 And yet it was \u2014 it was a very narrow radicalism. They concentrated on, you know, your sex life and maybe how you spent your money. But what struck me and \u2014 and many of my friends in the 1960s was \u2014 it was also an important question: Are you going to yield your racism to the lordship of Jesus Christ, you know? Are you willing to be obedient to the gospel even when it goes against what your government asks you to do? Those were very important questions, and it was really the radicalism of those hymns that went well beyond anything that I think the people who sang them \u2014 who taught them to me \u2014 anything that they intended. But \u2014 but I took the words \u2014 I \u2014 I saw myself as taking the words more seriously, in some cases, than \u2014 than they did. You name the passion, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the exhilaration of \u2014 of the \u2014 those \u2014 the civil rights movement and those political movements that you become involved in, and \u2014 and I also think when I read your work that there\u2019s a real emotionalism to \u2014 you know, to a gospel tent meeting that you describe. Is that for you also a defining characteristic of fundamentalism? Yeah. I \u2014 I have to say \u2014 and I was \u2014 I was with a group of sort of ex-fundamentalist types recently, and I think I made them a little nervous by saying this, but I said, you know, since those fundamentalist days I\u2019ve explored a lot of different strands of Christian spirituality \u2014 you know, Benedictine and Franciscan and, you know, the desert fathers and the desert mothers and \u2014 and all these wonderful things, and I\u2019ve learned so much. But in those moments, in those old revival meetings when the \u2014 the preacher would say, `Every head bowed and every eye closed and look into your heart and are \u2014 do you really love Jesus?\u2019 For me those were some of the most sacred moments of my life. I don\u2019t think I ever since then have experienced the transcendence that I experienced. You know, we\u2019ve talked in these months with regard to Islam, but also in a general way about the root \u2014 root sources of fundamentalism. And \u2014 and I think a positive question in there is what \u2014 what draws people \u2014 what is the \u2014 the human appeal of fundamentalist religious experience? And \u2014 and I wonder if you could say something about that from a Christian perspective. You know, in our \u2014 in our so-called postmodern culture there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of confusion about questions of truth and value, morality, meaning, but there are a lot of folks who just care about how their kids are going to grow up. As I go out into the churches, for example, the \u2014 the more conservative, fundamentalist-type churches, I \u2014 I meet so many parents who \u2014 who have gotten into that just because they wanted someplace they could bring their kids where they would get something about a life that has meaning, that has solid values, that promises good things about the future. And fundamentalists \u2014 I want to say, at its best, fundamentalism gives people some things to rely on, some \u2014 some solid foundations. I don\u2019t think we ought to dismiss that as a silly thing or some kind of inferior impulses. And for many people \u2014 and my own life is an example of this \u2014 it was a good place to begin. It just wasn\u2019t a good place to end up. But I\u2019ll always be grateful for people who, in my earliest days, told me that \u2014 that Jesus loved me, that there\u2019s a God who\u2019s in charge of history, that there\u2019s a book that we can turn to to find answers to some of the most basic issues of life, and I\u2019ve nuanced that. It\u2019s gotten a lot more complex for me. But the fundamental way of viewing it is still what I hang on to for dear life. Richard Mouw is president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. His books include, \u201CThe Smell of Sawdust: What Evangelicals Can Learn From Their Fundamentalist Heritage.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith. We\u2019re talking about \u201CThe Power of Fundamentalism\u201D in three lives. I grew up in a Holocaust survivor family in Brooklyn in the early \u201960s. Yossi Klein Halevi, an author and contributing editor to The New Republic, describes himself as a former Jewish extremist. He lives in Jerusalem. The Holocaust was the background and the foreground of our family life, which was very warm and loving but was also in some way an act of defiance. Against Hitler, we survived. My father was a survivor from Hungary who survived the war by living in a hole in the forest. That event \u2014 I would say that that hole was the prison through which I was raised to see the world \u2014 the notion of the Jews as a besieged, pursued, hated people, a people that could never find its place with the rest of humanity. In his teens, Yossi Klein Halevi became involved in militant quasi-terrorist activities of the Jewish Defense League, and he was a leader in a movement called the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry. In his late \u201920s in 1982, Yossi Klein Halevi moved to Israel, which he describes as his spiritual home. Now he is Israeli correspondent for The New Republic, and a commentator on Israeli affairs for the Los Angeles Times. He is a committed Zionist, an observant Jew, and at the same time a spiritual seeker and a politically moderate Israeli. He spoke with me from his home in Jerusalem about what his life has taught him of religious fundamentalism\u2019s power. To be a fundamentalist means to be wholly immersed \u2014 not holy, H \u2014 H-O-L-Y \u2014 but quite the opposite \u2014 wholly\u2026 All right. \u2026to be wholly immersed in your own theology, your own suffering, your own drama, your own historical and theological drama, to the absolute exclusion of any other drama. But the truth is, when I look back on it, it really allowed me to \u2014 to turn what otherwise could have been a \u2014 an emotionally crippling experience into a very vigorous youth. You are part of the chosen people, you\u2019re part of \u2014 of an el \u2014 a spiritual elite. You are `it.\u2019 Right. And \u2014 and there is nothing more exhilarating than being `it.\u2019 The word `intensity\u2019 recurs\u2026 Yeah. \u2026a great deal in your memoir, and that word, I think, has a particular appeal for young people. You know, not long ago I \u2014 I went up to Nazareth into Galilee where a group of Muslim fundamentalists are camping out, trying to build a mosque that will overshadow the Basilica of the Annunciation, and really a typical fundamentalist move of trying to \u2014 to overshadow another faith by even just physically building a bigger religious structure. And were they \u2014 they Palestinian? Yes, they were Palestinian, and I went up there and I spent some time with these young people, and I was struck by their pleasantness, and it really brought me back to my teen-age years \u2014 the self-confidence, the \u2014 the disdain, and among themselves the private jokes. Being in \u2014 in \u2014 in a fundamentalist world \u2014 it\u2019s so funny. I mean, that \u2014 that\u2019ll sound ludicrous to outsiders, but when you are with your friends, out away from the cameras, there is nothing funnier than sitting around with a group of fundamentalist insiders and laughing at the rest of the world. And so much of the fundamentalists\u2019 humor is mocking all the jerks outside, and everyone outside your circle is a jerk \u2014 everyone. Talk about that. Talk about how your perception of the humanity of those you are fighting \u2014 or perhaps you feel you\u2019re defending yourself \u2014 but your \u2014 your opponents\u2026 Right. \u2026how your understanding of that i \u2014 is changed, distorted by fundamentalist thinking. Are they human beings? Look, right now I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m talking to you from \u2014 from a battle zone. I\u2019m in Jerusalem. We hear ambulances regularly on the road just below where I live. I live at the \u2014 the very edge of Jerusalem, literally the last row of houses before the Judean desert and \u2014 and West Bank begins, so I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sitting physically on the border, the precise point of the border. (Sound bite of bombing site aftermath) I feel the war impinging constantly, so that my relationship with Muslim fundamentalism is not neutral, it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for me to feel that empathy which \u2014 which in better times I am able to draw on. But right now I feel that my \u2014 my children are on the front lines every time they step outside the door, every time they go on a bus. And my daughter \u2014 my 16-year-old daughter was telling me the other day that the first thing she does, she gets on a bus \u2014 she immediately sits in the back because she knows that suicide bombers tend to blow themselves up in the center of the bus to \u2014 to kill more people, and then she \u2014 she scans all the passengers to see who the likely candidates are, whether there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s anyone on the bus who might be a suicide bomber. And then when she looks around and she sees everyone looks OK, then she \u2014 she\u2019ll put on her headphones and listen to her music. Tell me what you understand, explain to me what\u2019s going on in the mind of someone who thinks it\u2019s righteous and virtuous to sit in the middle of a bus with a bomb. For the suicide bomber, the victims are abstract. They\u2019re not even real people. They\u2019re props in an apocalyptic drama in which he is the star. And all of history, all of humanity has been set up for his passion and for his justification, for him to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his \u2014 to right the wrongs that have been done to him, to his people, to his religion \u2014 so that this is an event that is not just sanctioned by God but has been set up by God as the culminating moment of human experience, the \u2014 the \u2014 the culminating moment of the purpose of God\u2019s creation, which is to right the wrongs \u2014 the cosmic wrongs that have been done. It\u2019s to banish evil. And that is what\u2019s going through the mind of the fundamentalist terrorist, and that emotion I know very well because, although I personally was not involved directly in \u2014 in terrorist acts as a teen-ager, some of my closest friends were people who were planting bombs at Soviet embassies to try to pressure the Soviet Union at that time to free the Jews, to allow Jewish emigration. And I was intimately involved with those people and tangentially involved with that terrorist world. And the fantasies that I had of \u2014 of destroying the enemies of the Jews \u2014 they were \u2014 they were moments almost of \u2014 not almost; they were moments of religious ecstasy. So I wonder if something that distinguishes, say, a positive religious moment from this kind of destructive religious moment is, in fact, the focus of the motivation? Right. Something that became clear to me also in reading your work is this \u2014 this tightrope that a religious fundamentalist walks, that in focusing on evil there is the danger of becoming evil oneself; in \u2014 in living with a consciousness of enemies, one becomes an enemy. That\u2019s a really good point that you\u2019re making, and \u2014 and that is that when you put darkness, evil, injustice as the center point of your cosmology, then you risk being co-opted, drawn into \u2014 into that darkness. And I think that that was one of the moments for me of revelation of how my obsession with Jewish suffering, with the Holocaust, was \u2014 was distorting my \u2014 my life and my spiritual life. Former Jewish extremist Yossi Klein Halevi. This is Speaking of Faith, and I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today we\u2019re exploring the power of religious fundamentalism in our world today. After Yossi Klein Halevi turned away from fundamentalism in his 20s, he was deeply influenced by research on people who had suffered catastrophic traumas, like the Holocaust or the Soviet gulags. He learned that they survived and created meaningful lives afterward by reaching out to others and drawing on their own deepest spiritual foundations. Eventually he became profoundly curious about the other religions with which he shares life in Israel. In 2001, he published \u201CAt the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A Jew\u2019s Search for God with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land.\u201D Yossi Klein Halevi proposes that only when Jews and Palestinians understand themselves not as victims but as survivors can fundamentalism be defused. Still, I asked him how the survivor approaches the world so differently from the victim. I think the \u2014 the survivor understands that this is in its very nature a horrible world, a world of unbearable suffering, a world that I would say \u2014 a world where \u2014 where the soul really doesn\u2019t belong. And what the survivor tries to \u2014 to learn from his or her experience is generosity rather than rage. Fundamentalists crave easy answers. The survivor understands that there are no easy answers in this world, and the more you get closer to how God must see this world, the more you\u2019re able to take on paradoxes, contradictions, and that forces you into a mode of constant empathy where you force yourself to constantly look at how the world appears to others. And again, you know, in better moments, sitting here in \u2014 in Israel \u2014 in better moments I\u2019ve been able to at least try to develop that sense of empathy toward the Palestinians, toward the \u2014 the Islamic world. It\u2019s much easier when you don\u2019t feel under constant attack. Right. And \u2014 and what I\u2019m so aware of in this journey that you describe with other faiths also is that you recovered precisely the thing that gets lost in the fundamentalist experience, which is the \u2014 the humanity. You know, you wrote about one Muslim Sufi sheik, \u201CSuddenly the menacing mask had a benign face.\u201D Hm. Right. Right. I \u2014 I think that the journey that I took into these two faiths was a conscious refutation of \u2014 of who I once was. The fundamentalist is ready, in theory at least, to give his or her life for \u2014 for their faith. And I felt that my transition from fundamentalist to pluralist wouldn\u2019t be complete until I\u2019d managed to draw on that fundamentalist vitality and in some way transmute it. And I decided I needed to not just engage Muslims and Christians in dialogue, but actually\u2026 Right. That\u2019s where we always go, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. We go to dialogue. You know \u2014 no, I \u2014 I \u2014 I felt in here, this is what I learned \u2014 this is what I learned from the fundamentalists. It\u2019s not enough to talk. You have to live it. You have to fully immerse \u2014 you have to live your belief to its ultimate moment and enter all of your fears. And \u2014 and, believe me, there were moments when I was terrified, sitting in a mosque in a Gaza refugee camp, wearing a Jewish skullcap; and you really wonder, are you going to get out of the camp alive? (Excerpt from musical selection) What I learned in that very small and limited experiment was that when one approaches another faith with reverence and love, the resistance and the \u2014 all of the political and theological and psychological barriers that keep us apart, especially in this land, somehow get bypassed and you\u2019re able to get through in a way that is \u2014 is \u2014 is impossible when the discourse is confined to \u2014 to discourse. Mm-hmm. And to political solutions, I suppose\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026and political vocabulary. At this point, I don\u2019t believe there is a political solution to this conflict. I \u2014 I think there\u2019s so much accumulated rage and resentment and misunderstanding that I personally despair of a political breakthrough. I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re anywhere near a spiritual breakthrough, either, although God doesn\u2019t need millions of people in order to effect change. Where spiritual process differs, perhaps, from \u2014 from the political reality is that it doesn\u2019t require masses of people in the same way that political change does. In fact, if you look at the history of religion, any religion, it\u2019s the story of a few eccentrics, a few obsessives, who take it upon themselves to make their lives examples of that vision, which \u2014 which doesn\u2019t yet exist, and allow themselves to become almost entry points through which the divine presence can interact with humanity and change humanity. So the way to resist fundamentalism is not through anger and hatred, because they\u2019ll win. You cannot outhate a fundamentalist. The only way to \u2014 to win against fundamentalism is by drawing on those divine qualities that we as human beings are called upon by every faith at its best to emulate, and those are the qualities of an open heart, of empathy and peace.
