  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Nicholas Kristof has won two Pulitzer Prizes covering some of recent history\u2019s worst atrocities \u2014 the Tiananmen Square massacre in China; genocide in Darfur. But he became aware of the reality so many of us know as consumers of news \u2014 that reporting from devastating situations can be overwhelming, numbing our sense of whether it matters that we care, what difference we could possibly make. So Nicholas Kristof began to draw on new science that reveals the limits of human empathy \u2014 why it shuts down, and how to open it again. I gained a new appreciation for his journalistic ethos through an HBO documentary, \u201CReporter,\u201D that followed him to Congo. We\u2019ll listen to some scenes from that film, as we explore what Nicholas Kristof has learned from looking straight on at some of the hardest things in the world. \u201CJournalism and Compassion.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. I interviewed Nicholas Kristof in 2010. He\u2019s been an op-ed columnist for The New York Times since 2001. He followed a well-trodden path to the Times \u2014 writing for The Harvard Crimson as an undergraduate, freelancing as a journalist while studying law as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. And he had two university professors as parents. But Nicholas Kristof\u2019s father was also an Armenian-Romanian immigrant, who came to the U.S. after surviving his own political traumas. And he raised his son on a farm in Oregon reminiscent of the lost land of his childhood. First of all, I just have to say you grew up on a sheep and cherry farm, which sounds so lovely and also a little bit is a funny juxtaposition \u2014 sheep and cherries. Well, I mean, I think I\u2019m probably one of the few people in the New York Times newsroom who knows how to weld or give birth to a lamb. Although both of your parents were scholars. That\u2019s right. And I also just wonder, if you look at your childhood, do you see the roots of what\u2019s really become very defining about your journalism of an interest in compassion and empathy in human life and a kind of longing to spark that in people? Well, I think that I always had some interest in individuals, some drive to try to make a difference, and I think that was one of the things that attracted me to journalism. But I also think it, you know, would have been entirely possible that I would have ended up a business reporter writing about corporate earnings. And really what changed me onto the trajectory that I ended up on is that I went out and was assigned abroad, lived a good chunk of my life abroad, and just encountered poverty. And that was just, you know, life-transforming. That once these issues become real and you see these things, you know, you can\u2019t forget the people you meet and you want to try to make a difference in some way. Where did you first encounter poverty, really, in that way? Maybe when I was a student at Oxford. I used to spend the vacations traveling around, you know, with a backpack. So I remember hopping the ferry from Spain into Morocco and traveling around Morocco and, you know, running into a little girl who was begging and taking around her grandfather who had river blindness and was blind. You know, they were begging and they could communicate a little bit in French. You know, all of a sudden, she was very real, her grandfather was real, and you could imagine them as, you know, people that I\u2019d grown up with or members of my family. Right. You know, it just seemed so horrific that this kind of thing should still be happening. You know, something that has impressed me over the years in your journalism is that you\u2019ve talked about and kind of revealed moments of learning in public \u2014 and then there\u2019s a sense in which you\u2019ve been more \u2014 I don\u2019t know if vulnerable is the right word, but open, which journalists aren\u2019t always, you know. Of course, when you\u2019re reporting on things, you\u2019re learning, but then you present it as information. Columnists, I think, you know, wield opinions, let\u2019s say, more than you do. But you often yield moments of discovery and you\u2019re very clear that you discovered something and you didn\u2019t know this before. I\u2019m just also curious about, you know, is that an experience you had of journalism early on, or is that something that has developed for you? Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? Yeah. I mean, maybe because I lived for years in China, I\u2019m very suspicious of ideologues \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 of whatever complexion, and I think it\u2019s really important to learn empirically and to test your ideas and, you know, occasionally be wrong. I also think that it\u2019s more \u2014 that you\u2019re more persuasive when you acknowledge that, you know, you have changed your views and you explain how that process happened. You know, you do feel a little bit naked when you confess \u2026 Right. \u2026 in a column that you screwed up. Yeah. But I think that it ultimately gives you a little bit more credibility with readers. Mm-hmm. So I spent part of this morning watching the documentary that\u2019s been made about you, \u201CReporter.\u201D I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve seen it. I have. OK. It\u2019s a little \u2014 it\u2019s a strange experience to watch yourself. I bet it is. Well, yeah. That\u2019s also another role a journalist usually isn\u2019t in, of being the focus of the \u2026 Yeah, and that was strange. I mean, I let this camera crew trail around with me in eastern Congo, you know, because I deeply wanted this issue to get a little bit on television. But there were times out there where, I mean, I would have throttled that cameraman if it wouldn\u2019t have undermined my humanitarian image. Right. But, you know, but ultimately, I was so impressed with what he did, and I think it really did help get the word out about what is happening there. I think it does and will, and I also was really impressed with it. In as much as Congo is the focus, I think also a big interest for the people making the film and for the people watching it is, again, what motivates you as a journalist. So, you know, there\u2019s a line right at the beginning \u2014 I think you\u2019re walking in Rwanda their at that point; I\u2019m not sure. They\u2019re talking about you and they say, \u201CHe\u2019s here with a single objective, to make you care about what\u2019s just over the hills.\u201D So this got me thinking, as a lot of your writing has gotten me thinking, about the role of journalism and the changing role of journalism. We talk a lot about the changing role of journalism in terms of different platforms, right? Yeah. But \u2026 I mean, I guess the way I see it \u2014 when I first got the column after 9/11, after 2001, then, you know, I thought, OK, I\u2019ll be this pundit, I\u2019ll fire out these opinions, I\u2019ll change peoples\u2019 minds, you know, over breakfast. It turned out that it really doesn\u2019t work that way that, by and large, if I write about an issue that people have already thought about, then \u2026 It should be like the political news of the day. Oh, the political news of the day. Then people who start out agreeing with me think I\u2019m brilliant, and people who start out disagreeing with me think I\u2019ve utterly missed the point. And so over time, I came to think that, in fact, the power of a column and maybe more broadly the power of journalism isn\u2019t so much to change peoples\u2019 minds on issues that are already on the agenda, but rather it\u2019s the capacity to shine a spotlight on some issue and then thereby project it on the agenda. Mm-hmm. And on so many of the issues that I care deeply about, the reason that they\u2019re not being addressed is simply because they\u2019re not on the agenda. And shining a spotlight and making people uncomfortable about what they see in that spotlight, I think truly is the first step toward getting more resources and more attention and more energy dedicated to solving them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, on \u201CJournalism and Compassion.\u201D In addition to spotlighting crises like those in Darfur or Congo, he focuses on global issues below the radar. Many of them have women at their center. And this is the subject of a book he\u2019s written together with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, called Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide. Again to this idea of motivation, do you feel that also this kind of journalism that you\u2019re doing \u2014 I mean, shining a light on places and problems that people should know about and should mobilize about, that there\u2019s a shift there in a journalistic ethos as well? I mean, how do you think about that? Yeah. I mean, I think traditionally both historians and journalists essentially wrote about what \u2014 in traditional terms \u2014 what the king said yesterday or, in modern terms, what the president announced. And that, over time, you began to see historians over the last few decades increasingly look at what ordinary people were doing. And likewise, I think we in journalism are broadening our sense of what history is and what our first rough draft should be and looking at these broader trends. And, you know, that was really something that my wife, Sheryl WuDunn, who\u2019s also a journalist, and I, you know, over time we began to rethink what kind of things we should be writing on. In particular, in China, for example, one of the milestones of our careers was covering the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and the massacre that resulted, killing hundreds of people. I was there in Tiananmen Square. I was revolted by what I saw. For weeks, every story we wrote was on the front page. Right. But then the next year, we came across a study indicating that every year in China 39,000 baby girls were dying because they didn\u2019t get the same food and health care as boys, and we\u2019d never given one column inch to that issue. And there were something like 50 million women who were missing in China, discriminated against to death, in effect, and we\u2019d never covered that at all. It began to make us think that maybe our journalistic priorities were too narrowly on what governments did and that some of the biggest human rights issues actually had to do with society rather than with governments. I\u2019ve been really intrigued also by how you have then become very interested, even in a scientific level, at how people will respond to these kinds of stories, right? Outrage fatigue, compassion fatigue is a phrase that\u2019s out there. So what have you learned because even just what you\u2019ve just said about the thousands and millions of deaths, I\u2019m very worried that those kinds of statistics are debilitating and paralyzing for people. And you\u2019re right. My fascination with the science of this, with the social psychology and the neurology of this, really grew out of my frustration with what I was writing about Darfur. I\u2019d go out to Darfur and I\u2019d see these villages burned down, kids massacred, women raped, and I would write these columns and it just felt like they were just disappearing into the pond without a ripple. In the meantime, at more or less the same time in New York, I don\u2019t know if you remember, there was a red-tailed hawk named Pale Male that got pushed out of his nest. I don\u2019t remember that. Well, there was a pair of hawks and the male was called Pale Male and he was living in a condo building on Central Park. He was evicted by the building, and New Yorkers were just up in arms about this homeless red-tailed hawk. And I was sort of frustrated I couldn\u2019t get the same reaction for hundreds of thousands of people being driven out of their homes as for one red-tailed hawk. So that led me to look at the work in neurology and social psychology about what makes us care. As you suggest, it\u2019s not about numbers; it\u2019s not about statistics. It\u2019s really about an emotional connection, and it\u2019s the emotional parts of the brain that light up when the brain is being imaged that lead to some kind of a moral decision. It\u2019s not the rational parts, and \u2026 Right. But there\u2019s some way you put that and somewhere you said that the emotional response becomes a portal and then rational arguments like numbers can play a supporting role. Exactly. It\u2019s really interesting. That opening, that connection, that empathy, is really an emotional one. It\u2019s done based on individual stories. And we all know that there is this compassion fatigue as the number of victims increases, but what the research has shown that is kind of devastating is that the number at which we begin to show fatigue is when the number of victims reaches two. Right. Would you tell the story about Rokia and Moussa, the photograph that they used to illustrate this? Yeah. This is from the work of a psychologist called Paul Slovic. There were experiments where people were shown a photo of a starving girl from Mali called Rokia, a seven-year-old girl, and asked to contribute in various different scenarios. And then also a boy named Moussa. And essentially people would donate a lot of money. If they saw that Rokia was hungry, they wanted to help her. Likewise, when they saw a picture of Moussa, they wanted to help him. But the moment you put the two of them together and asked people to help both Rokia and Moussa, then at that point donations dropped. And by the time you ask them to donate to 21 million hungry people in West Africa, you know, nobody wanted to contribute at all. Because they\u2019re overwhelmed by that, or it doesn\u2019t spark the same reaction that actually enables people to act. Is that \u2026 Yeah. I think it\u2019s not real. I mean, I think that my job as a journalist is to find these larger issues that I want to address, but then find some microcosm of it, some Rokia who can open those portals and hopefully get people to care. And once that portal is open, then you can indeed begin to put in some of the background, some of the context, some of the larger issues, and hopefully get people to engage with that issue. And, you know, again in this documentary film, \u201CReporter,\u201D the narrator is young from my imagining \u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s reasonably true, which means younger than me. Yeah, or me. You know, I wonder, in the Congo, he\u2019s saying, you know, that what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 you talk to a lot of people who have been suffering in a lot of ways. You see some terrible things, but he says you\u2019re looking for your Rokia, for this story. The next morning, we were out again. By this point, I had grown deeply suspicious of Nick\u2019s method of seeking out the worst suffering in order to tell a story. But my misgivings kept crashing into the same hard logic \u2014 that the saddest stories exist whether or not Nick finds them. And if those stories have the greatest capacity to inspire action, then Nick\u2019s strategy makes sense functionally. Regardless, this kind of dismal illumination doesn\u2019t feel very good. I wonder if you have misgivings about that too, even as you\u2019re talking about the scientific basis for it. Yeah. I mean, I periodically do. It does feel sometimes a little bit manipulative. The other aspect of it is that people connect with stories that are kind of ultimately positive or triumphant. They want to be a part of something successful. And so when Sheryl and I were writing our book about women around the world, Half the Sky, we were very much looking for stories of individuals that would plumb the depths of terrible things that happen, but ultimately end on this kind of inspiring, happy note. And that in particular I \u2014 you know, I worried a little bit about. If we\u2019re selecting stories of women who, whatever, have been trafficked or gone through a fistula or whatever it may be, through some kind of deplorable sexual violence, but ultimately have triumphed in some unbelievably wonderful, inspiring way, then, you know, is that a little bit too manipulative? Is that going over a line? Is that unrepresentative? I mean, ultimately that\u2019s what we did because we were afraid that, you know, people are turned off by unremitting despair, and you need to show that one can make a difference. But I do worry about that, absolutely. Another thing that it made me wonder \u2014 not just that, but the science of this and what you\u2019ve learned, that you could go and you could tell the whole horrific story with all the numbers and that, in fact, would not mobilize newspaper readers across the world the way one thinks it should. You know, when you use word genocide now, ever after, after the Holocaust, as people do with Darfur, they use the word genocide; you use the word genocide, I think. I do. We think back to an idea we have, I believe, in the West that, if we\u2019d only known, right? If it had only been covered, that holocaust, that surely it wouldn\u2019t have unfolded as it did. I don\u2019t know. I think that what some of this stuff you\u2019re learning suggests that that might not be true. Darfur is, I think, a window into that issue because, in past genocides, one could make the argument, not always terribly effectively, but one could at least try to make the argument that, at the time the killing was going on, we didn\u2019t really fully know. We didn\u2019t have a complete appreciation of just how awful it is and if only we had known. And in fact, in the case of Darfur, we knew exactly what was going on. And it was on television; it was in the news and, you know, it has now gone on in one degree or another longer than World War II did. Right. Something else I wonder about is, you know, many of the kinds of things you talk about, for example, your work with your wife, Sheryl WuDunn, on women. There are kind of words and phrases that people go around thinking themselves should be galvanizing, mobilizing, like human rights or injustice, are in fact very controversial, very politically laden. They\u2019ve got ideological connotations for some people. I wonder if you think about that, about vocabulary and about having to shake up, I mean, even not rely on phrases that one thinks should be effective. Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m very engaged in what I\u2019m writing about \u2014 Congo or Darfur or any of these issues, and really trying to grab the reader. You know, I know that your average reader, if they come across my column on the subway to work and they see that it\u2019s about Darfur, for example, you know, OK, they\u2019ve got to be at work in 30 minutes, they know terrible things are happening in Darfur, but it\u2019s not really going to be relevant to them that day and they\u2019re likely to turn the page. So I try to use whatever mix of headline, engaging first sentence, occasionally in the case of a headline, maybe a little bit of bait and switch, to try to, you know, to suck people in. Mm-hmm, and not assume that there\u2019s any code or shorthand that\u2019s going to be universally interesting or appealing. No, and I think that, in fact, we tend to, in journalism especially and probably especially in opinions, we tend to speak to our own communities and we tend to recite the arguments that are most persuasive to those who already want to do whatever you do, but are often least persuasive to those who come at this \u2014 you know, who are skeptical. At onbeing.org, watch extended scenes from the HBO documentary about Nicholas Kristof in Congo. Also, learn more about the children \u2014 Rokia and Moussa \u2014 at the center of Paul Slovic\u2019s unexpected findings on compassion fatigue. When I interviewed Nicholas Kristof in 2010, his energies were very much focused on Congo and Darfur. Since then, he\u2019s spent a great deal of time in the Middle East, where he\u2019s telling the still-unfolding story of the Arab Spring. And as technology evolves, he\u2019s making active use of social platforms like Facebook and Twitter to expand conversation about the complexity of all that he\u2019s witnessing. Coming up, Nicholas Kristof on why victims can\u2019t always be believed, and why he\u2019s stepped up \u2014 controversially for some of his readers \u2014 to praise conservative Christian activists he once dismissed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: \u201CJournalism and Compassion,\u201D with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. He\u2019s won his two Pulitzers covering a massacre and a genocide. But he learned that such reporting can deaden rather than awaken the conscience, much less the hearts, of his readers. The journalistic approach he\u2019s developed in response is the subject of a documentary film, \u201CReporter,\u201D that followed him to Rwanda and Congo. He\u2019s been describing how he uses his column to bring faraway cultures and conflicts alive by way of individual human stories. Nicholas Kristof has reported in over 140 countries. I\u2019d like to talk about some of the things that you\u2019ve written about that you\u2019ve learned in all your travels and all the stories you\u2019ve covered that I think are counterintuitive \u2026 OK. \u2026 or that might sound counterintuitive. So for example, I started thinking \u2014 I wrote down this realpolitik of compassion because you are out there representing, embodying, compassion for many people, trying to spark it with your work, but you\u2019re very pragmatic and you\u2019ve learned a lot. For example, you said there\u2019s a tendency to believe victims and that\u2019s not necessary right. Yeah. I\u2019ve learned this the hard way. OK. When you go out and you come across some brutal injustice, soldiers who\u2019ve massacred people, then the immediate tendency is not only to feel sympathy for those who\u2019ve been butchered, but also to believe their stories. And, you know, in fact, it turns out that victims lie just as perpetrators lie. And they are so outraged by what has been done to them that they often exaggerate, and you have to be just as meticulous and insistent upon verification when you\u2019re talking to those victims as you would be skeptical when talking to the perpetrators. Something that really struck me in the documentary and this is also things you wrote about. You met a warlord, a Congolese warlord. There is so much paradox there. I mean, for starters, right, this line between who\u2019s the victim and who\u2019s the perpetrator is thin, right? Because, I mean, he started out as a victim. Yeah, and perpetrators usually claim that they are victims and that is why they have to massacre the other side. Yeah. Then there was the religious fervor, that Christian fervor, which seemed \u2014 I mean, in this case because it was filmed, I got to watch it too. Well, you know, I couldn\u2019t believe it when this warlord who, you know, was well-known for being involved in mass killings and mass rapes and just brutal predations of people there, he came out with a button on his chest that said, \u201CRebels for Christ.\u201D You know, where did that come from? In fact, the warlord\u2019s officers and soldiers prayed over refreshments they offered Nicholas Kristof and two student journalists he brought along on that trip to Congo. I have to tell you that I was watching this and my 12-year-old son walked in and he hadn\u2019t seen anything else. He said, \u201CYou know, those guys don\u2019t seem so bad.\u201D And you know what he was seeing too. I mean, there was a real charisma about the warlord maybe not so much, but the people around him. Yeah. I mean, frankly, that is often true. You know, if you go and \u2014 I often do try to go out and sort of seek out the perpetrators partly because, frankly, I want to understand what it is that drives some people to go and butcher children. You know, what makes those people tick? I mean, what have you learned about that? I\u2019ve learned that people have an amazing capacity for self-delusion, to feel themselves threatened and then this is the only way to address the risks to those they care about, and that, in general, even the most savage butchers will treat their own little community, their own clan, their own friends and, fortunately for me, their invited guests, with, you know, considerable courtesy and warmth and friendship. I mean, how does that \u2014 this idea of what it means to be human. I mean, how does that change your thinking about humanity and the world your children are growing up in? I think that, when Sheryl and I lived in Japan, I was fascinated with the older generation of Japanese who had committed unbelievable atrocities in China, the Philippines, and so many places, and yet were the most courteous, civil people who I could have imagined. And I interviewed an awful lot of them. And I think that one of the things that struck me was just how fine a line it is and that, when you feel threatened and when there are especially a kind of a group of you, this mob instinct can take over and you \u2014 we \u2014 are capable of doing things that, you know, ultimately later we can\u2019t believe we did, that we\u2019re ashamed about. And I think this is something that, you know, it\u2019s a human tendency that we really need to push back against very deeply when we do feel these kinds of fears. I think something that\u2019s related to that that you also have emphasized is the importance of security and maybe even taking precedence over, whether we\u2019re talking about democracy, that it is a prerequisite for helping alleviate poverty. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a message people want to hear. It\u2019s something that\u2019s come through so much in my conversations about a lot of subjects over the years also that one of the things in this culture, in the U.S., that we take for granted and don\u2019t realize we take for granted, don\u2019t realize how much it makes possible, is the rule of law \u2014 this seemingly simple fact of life. Yeah. I mean, there is always the tendency to think that the most humanitarian thing you can do is to go build a school, build a hospital. And I remember in Central African Republic coming across a clinic \u2014 well, the only thing left of it was a little sign out front saying, \u201CBuilt by the German Aid Agency.\u201D You know, because people were willing to build clinics, but they weren\u2019t willing to help provide security, so some warlord had come through and burned it and who knows what had happened to the doctors and the nurses and the patients. I saw the same thing in Chad, for example, that once you lose security, then farmers can\u2019t go into their fields, so they starve. You know, people sometimes sell their daughters. You can\u2019t begin to address other humanitarian needs until you begin to address security. And I think that that \u2014 especially in the aftermath of Iraq and the mess in Afghanistan \u2014 it is something that is, you know, really hard for us to figure out how to do and even hard for us to talk about as a humanitarian issue. I mean, you also write about how some of the things that we look at as problems, like a sweatshop \u2014 I mean, you\u2019ve written a lot about this. It\u2019s not necessarily the problem that we imagined. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m one of the few Americans who is truly sympathetic to sweatshops really because of the time I spent in Asia and seeing the way they became an avenue for people to ride the escalator up and that they provided a lot of employment for people, which tended to be wretched jobs, but usually not as wretched as working in a rice paddy or in construction jobs or selling cigarettes in the street or, you know, a million other jobs that tend to be available. My fear has been that the hostility to sweatshops has meant that manufacturers don\u2019t go to Africa. I mean, Africa\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that it has sweatshops; it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t have any sweatshops. And typically, the only thing worse than a sweatshop is indeed no sweatshop at all, no employment whatsoever. I mean, I guess the other thing that I really do worry about \u2014 I mean, if I were critiquing my own kind of approach, just between you and me \u2026 I won\u2019t tell anyone. It would be often I focus on things that go wrong, that when I write about Africa, for example, so much of it is about the Congo or Sudan or about AIDS in southern Africa or about malaria or pneumonia, whatever it may be. That conjures an image in the reader of a continent that is completely screwed up, that doesn\u2019t have anything working out for it. And the upshot of that is to dampen tourism, dampen business investment, and just leave people discouraged about the possibilities of the continent in a way that is really misleading. I mean, there are a lot of parts of Africa that have been incredibly successful. So that is something that troubles me and that I try to adjust my coverage to convey that more complicated reality. But that is something that I worry about in my kind of reporting. Do you think that your early experiences in Asia and your enduring interest in Asia gives you a certain kind of perspective on the possibilities in Africa\u2019s future? Yes. I\u2019m always struck that development experts who\u2019ve spent their careers in Africa tend to be pretty pessimistic. You know, development is just difficult and tough and you strive and maybe you\u2019ll make a little bit of difference somewhere. Meanwhile, development experts who\u2019ve spent their time in Asia, they sort of assume, ah, you toss out a few seeds and next day you\u2019ll have a big field. So in my time abroad, I saw the sprouting of China, I mean, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, all these countries. And they had different economic models. It wasn\u2019t, you know, one precise model, but it led you to believe that places are not hopeless and that we really can see just complete transformations that end up more or less eliminating the worst kinds of poverty. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today: \u201CJournalism and Compassion.\u201D I\u2019m speaking with op-ed columnist and author Nicholas Kristof. Some of his controversial writing has been about gaining a complex, contradictory view of religion as a force in the world. He\u2019s written critically as well as appreciatively, over time, about the Catholic Church, Islam, and Pentecostal and Evangelical Christianity. You wrote, I think this was in 2008, you wrote about Evangelicals as the new internationalists. You wrote this: \u201CLiberals believe deeply in tolerance and over the last century have led the battles against prejudices of all kinds, but we have a blind spot about Christian Evangelicals. They constitute one of the few minorities that, on the American coasts or university campuses, it remains fashionable to mock.\u201D What was the response you got to that column? It was absolute outrage from the coasts. Yes, and the university campuses? And the university campuses. And people who were, you know, incredibly indignant and saying that, you know, these are people who are spreading bigotry and hatred, and the proper thing to do is precisely to stand up to that kind of hatred and bigotry. I\u2019d say, from the Evangelical community, there was sort of a stunned, but somewhat welcome \u2014 you know, people were pleased, but sort of surprised. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s that column or a different column, but writing about Evangelicals\u2019 work in Africa, the headline was \u201CHug an Evangelical.\u201D And a little bit later, one of the Evangelical organizations that I never agree \u2014 maybe it was Focus on the Family, of course, which I disagree with 100 percent. They had a headline saying \u201CHug a Liberal.\u201D Oh, that\u2019s good. Yes. It was the beginning of our \u2026 You created empathy. Yes, exactly. You know, in some place, you suggest that bleeding-heart liberals need to reach out to bleeding-heart conservatives. I was going to ask you if bleeding-heart conservatives reach out to you. That sounds like maybe an example of that. No, they actually have. That really is something I believe in deeply, that, you know, if you look at sex trafficking, for example. This is one of the true outrages on the scene today, that there are probably more girls who are trafficked against their will today than people who were enslaved at the height of the slave trade. And they are more disposable because they\u2019re worth less money; their sales price is lower today than it was in 1860, after adjusting for inflation. So there\u2019s this huge issue here, and liberal feminists, secular feminists, are doing great work on it. Right-wing Christian Evangelicals are doing great work on it, but because there is this incredible gulf of mistrust between them, they tend not to cooperate. You don\u2019t even tend to have a similar vocabulary with which to address the issue. The right tends to talk about prostitutes; the left tends to talk about sex workers. Oh, that\u2019s interesting. And each side is just very suspicious of the other. But we\u2019re not going to make progress on this and, you know, we\u2019re not going to get those pimps in jail where they belong unless left and right and secular and religious are more willing to hold their nose and work together. Someplace someone asked you who your favorite philosopher was and you said it was Isaiah Berlin. Do you remember that? Yeah. I was studying law at Oxford and, of course, law is one of the more boring things you can possibly study, which is why I ended up as a journalist, or I\u2019d been a lawyer. But it\u2019s also why I began sort of reading more philosophy on the side, and I encountered Berlin\u2019s work and met him. I think what appeals to me most about Isaiah Berlin\u2019s writings is that so much of philosophy and so much of the Western world has been to search for the one true answer and whether it\u2019s utilitarianism, whether it\u2019s some kind of a Kantian categorical imperative, or whatever it is that we try to maximize and search for \u2026 Whether it\u2019s the ideology of left-wing feminism or right-wing Christianity. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. But there is this search for, you know, the one true answer. And Isaiah Berlin emphasized that it\u2019s more complicated than that and that there is maybe this deeply imbedded belief, you know, yearning for one answer, but that in fact there are many different things that we value. And they are incommensurate \u2014 that you want to maximize happiness, but the happiness yardstick, you can\u2019t make it link up with the dignity yardstick or the human rights yardstick or whatever it may be. And that these trade-offs are just a part of the human condition and that we have to struggle and search for answers and, at times, acknowledge that this is a tentative answer. We\u2019re not sure that we are right. And yet even acknowledging that, still act on that. You know, one of the problems, I think, for liberals is that they become paralyzed by complexity and paralyzed by the possibility that they\u2019re wrong. So Berlin, you know, in this very messy 21st-century world, Berlin kind of conveys a reality that speaks to me, and that helps me resolve my own challenges in life. You know, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of times when people interview you, they remark that you\u2019re less depressed and depressing than they expected you to be. Have you noticed that? You know, people must think that I just sort of sit around, that I\u2019m like Eeyore. But, in fact, you go out and, you know, you write about these terrible things happening around the world, but I come back not fundamentally depressed by them as just inspired by our capacity to make a difference, to respond, to do the right thing. Now on that same trip to the Congo that was in the movie, we saw the warlord and, you know, I was infuriated by him. But the person who I think spoke to me the most on that trip was a Polish nun in the town of Rutshuru who I met who was there in this little town that had been pretty much abandoned by aid groups. It was surrounded by warlords where there were killings every day, and she was singlehandedly feeding orphans, educating kids, staving off the warlords. And I was just so inspired by that kind of commitment to humanity, to trying to make a difference that it ultimately fundamentally left me reassured rather than depressed about humanity. So just going back to an early story you told about covering Tiananmen Square, which was a huge world event, which was on the front page of the papers for days. And then, as you said, in the year that followed, you and your wife, Sheryl WuDunn, who\u2019s also a journalist, became aware of this, in fact, much larger tragedy that was unfolding all the time of violence to girls. Right now, we could all easily draw a list of what\u2019s going to be on the front page of the newspaper tomorrow. You know, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, some kind of seeming clash between Islam and the West, climate change. But I wonder, as you look around right now, you know, what are things you know about that are under the radar, that are just as important, that you\u2019re watching? Well, we wrote \u2014 I mean, the evolution of finding out what was happening in rural China towards women was eventually writing this book in which we do argue that just as the central moral challenge in the 19th century was slavery, and in the 20th was totalitarianism, in this century the paramount moral challenge for the world will be the abuse that is directed toward so many women and girls around the world. I truly think that that is going to be one of the great subtexts of this century. You know, to get girls into school, to offer them opportunities, to stop bride burnings, sex trafficking, genital cutting \u2014 you know, this whole panoply of practices. So I think that that is one of the great undercurrents and the question of whether countries can make better use of the female half of their population. I mean, one of the things is to determine how successful they are and how stable and peaceful they can be. I think that would be one that I would emphasize. Another would be the question that, for all of human history and indeed for all of humanity, people have, by and large, many of them have lived in poverty. And in this century, we have the capacity to really end that extreme poverty and the question is whether we can really muster the political will and capacity to take those steps so that it will indeed be eradicated. And I think the analogy you draw is very interesting because there was political will and political movement eventually around slavery, for example. I mean, from where you sit, can you imagine that kind of energy, that kind of action, around these issues of women and \u2014 and of poverty? Yeah, I really can. I think it\u2019s very hard to predict what issues will engage people, but I think that, just as in the 1780s, once people became aware of what life was like on a slave ship, then they were revolted by it and couldn\u2019t stand it. I think in the same way that, you know, once people realize what goes on in forced prostitution, that they, you know, will react to it and will want to have those brothels closed down. And once they also see the opportunity that is created by educating girls and just how cheap it is and how much that can bolster an economy, that that will be an opportunity they will not want to pass up. So I think that things are coming together and that this kind of change is taking place already. You know, the question is just whether we\u2019re going to end up watching it or being a part of it.
