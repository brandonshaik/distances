  "fullText": "Tagore said, \u201CI\u2019m not a philosopher.\u201D I mean, people regarded him as a philosopher, but he rejected that label. So I think his whole view of life was profoundly influenced by the fact that he was an artist. There seems to be no aspect of life There seems to be practically no aspect of life that he didn\u2019t try to touch, to alter, to somehow bring around to his ideal of how things should be. That\u2019s the writer Anita Desai, on Rabindranath Tagore. This hour, we pull back what Anita Desai calls the dusty veils that have hidden his memory from history. This is the man who bestowed the title \u201CMahatma\u201D on Gandhi. Tagore was championed by Yeats and Pound to become the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. The Indian and Bangladeshi national anthems today are Tagore\u2019s compositions. And you may have seen a picture of him without knowing it \u2014 a famous photo of Tagore in long gray beard and flowing robe \u2014 sitting with Einstein in a suit and tie in Einstein\u2019s Berlin home, where they debated the deepest nature of reality. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Rabindranath Tagore was born on May 5, 1861 in Calcutta. His wealthy Bengali family also owned vast estates in what is now Bangladesh. As an adult, he managed these estates and conducted social and educational experiments there, some of which have remnants in India today. Later, we\u2019ll draw out Anita Desai on Tagore as a figure in her Bengali heritage and for her as a modern Indian writer. But first, British author Andrew Robinson. He co-authored a biography of Tagore called The Myriad-Minded Man. You know, as we begin, I\u2019d love to hear how you first discovered Tagore. What was your earliest awareness of him? What was the context in which that happened? That was through the films of Satyajit Ray\u2026 Oh, okay. Who was a student at Tagore\u2019s University, and Ray made several lovely films, some of them masterpieces based on Tagore\u2019s short stories and a novel. And he used a lot of Tagore\u2019s music. So I saw those when I was quite young, and then I wrote a biography of Ray and, of course, there was some of Tagore in there too. There\u2019s a line in your biography, The Myriad-Minded Man. \u201CHe is found everywhere in Bengali life, and yet he is lost.\u201D Yes, yes. Well, he is. He is found everywhere particularly in his songs which every single Bengali knows a bit about and many of them can sing them. But I think in many ways the complexity of the man is lost. He was much more than just a simple poet with a simple message. He was a complex figure, like Gandhi in that respect. Yes. Although, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re going to obviously flesh this out, but I wonder also if it is his very complexity that has made him hard to make him just a symbol of something. You know? Because it seems like he did so many things. I mean, this myriad-minded man is a good description, and he saw ambiguity in everything in such an interesting way. He was always evolving, it seems, all the way through his 80-plus years. Yes. And he always said in the years after he won the Nobel Prize that, you know, if I\u2019d stuck to doing the kind of poetry that first won me that prize \u2014 which W. B. Yeats so admired, the poetry called \u201CGitanjali,\u201Dsong offerings and some other collections \u2014 Tagore knew that, if he\u2019d stuck to doing this rather straightforwardly semi-mystical love poetry with a strong sense of the divine, he would have been a much \u2014 he\u2019d probably be a much more famous man now than he actually is because he did so many other things. He got bored, in a sense, and frustrated, I think, with the image that had been created at that time in his life in 1913 around the time of the First World War. And he wanted to get away from it in later life. You know, there\u2019s something in Tagore\u2019s personal trajectory that actually reminded me of the story of the Buddha. The prince enclosed, you know, living this life of containment and luxury who one day ventures out and sees all the suffering and the poverty and his vision is changed. And there\u2019s a bit of that in Tagore\u2019s story, I feel, but, I mean, you know this story better than I do. Yes, there is a bit, you\u2019re right. I mean, more in his father\u2019s case because his father was the son of an extremely wealthy man, grandfather of Rabindranath, known as Prince Dwarkanath Tagore. He wasn\u2019t actually a prince, but he was a merchant prince, India\u2019s first industrial entrepreneur, I think you could say, an incredible figure in his own right, but not at all a spiritual man, but also not a lackey of the East India Company or the British government. He was an independent man and he handed wealth down to his son and the son \u2014 the father of Rabindranath, that is, the Maharshi, as he was known, the Maharishi, so to speak \u2014 he rejected that as a young man, and so Tagore, the grandson, I think, inherited both traditions. The luxury-loving tradition of his grandfather and the austerity of his father. In a sense, they ran side by side throughout Tagore\u2019s life. You know, I think there\u2019s a sense \u2014 you used this phrase a minute ago when you said if he\u2019d just continued writing those semi-mystical poetry that had won him the Nobel Prize for literature, he might have stayed more famous. He was almost glorified by people like Yeats and Pound, in a way, imagining a spirituality in him that Britain had lost or that was not accessible to them. Yes, and not just Yeats and Pound. I mean, there was a whole sense that Tagore looked like Christ. I mean, many people said this. Literally looked like\u2026 Yes. Many people said that. At the passion play in Oberammergau, people said, \u201CHow like our prophet\u201D. It was a German audience. And Darwin\u2019s granddaughter, I think, said, \u201CI could now understand this powerful and gentle Christ, which I never could before,\u201D after seeing Tagore. So there was a very strong feeling that he represented moral goodness in addition to being a poet. And I think the First World War did have an effect on his reputation, which increased it and then, in the 20s, it to some extent collapsed\u2026 Because there was kind of this spiritual despair and vacuum of those years? Yes. Wilfred Owen took Tagore\u2019s poetry to the trenches\u2026 Right, of World War One. After Owen was killed, his pocketbook was sent back to his mother and there were some lines from Tagore in it. And she then wrote to Tagore when he visited London in 1920 and said, \u201CI would be very grateful if you could tell me where these lines come from.\u201D And those lines are to be found in the faculty library in Oxford University. You can see it still. Do you remember what they are? Or anything? Uh, \u201CWhen I go from hence, let this be my surpassing work\u201D \u2014 I haven\u2019t got this quite right. Yeah, that\u2019s okay. What was it expressing that is there in Tagore\u2019s thinking? Uh, I think it\u2019s expressing what he said was the great theme of his work, which was the finite in the infinite. All his work he felt was expressing that idea, and that\u2019s part of certain strands of Indian philosophy too. Is that connected to another idea that\u2019s there, that spirituality \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if he would have used that word \u2014 leads humanity from partiality to fullness. The finite and the infinite, partiality and fullness, the real and the unreal is another thing he talked about. Yes. He goes into this with Einstein, doesn\u2019t he, in a certain amount when they had a conversation with that rather wonderful headline in New York, \u201CA mathematician and the mystic plumb the truth\u201D . That was in The New York Times, wasn\u2019t it? Yes, yes. I liked that. Let\u2019s talk about that conversation he had with Einstein, because you\u2019ve written about that. You know, you were talking a minute ago about how he looked and, you know, he always, even after having won the Nobel Prize and being knighted \u2014 he had to relinquish that, but being knighted, he was very striking, stunning, longhaired, bearded, and many have of seen a photograph. There\u2019s a photograph that\u2019s often shown when people look at photos of Einstein, life of Einstein and Tagore. But many people don\u2019t \u2014 Tagore hasn\u2019t come down in memory for even the way Gandhi \u2014 certainly the way Gandhi or Einstein came down in memory. So he\u2019s this figure out there\u2026 Although you do find Tagore referred to the Encyclopedia Britannica actually on Einstein. You do find that, in fact. Really? Yes, the conversation between them is quoted there because it\u2019s so kind of precise, the difference between the two of them. Between the two of them, right. Who was it \u2014 Isaiah Berlin said, \u201CIt was a complete non-meeting of minds.\u201D Yes, that time he wrote that to me. And Isaiah Berlin knew of it because he\u2019d attended Tagore\u2019s lectures in Oxford in 1930 and he knew Einstein, so he knew both sides to some extent, yeah. But non-meeting of minds it may have been, but it\u2019s a fascinating dialog. And it remains, I think, fascinating today, reading it today. It\u2019s very interesting that Einstein is compelled to say at the end of this long discourse about truth and beauty and reality, \u201CThen I am more religious than you are.\u201D That\u2019s right . I am more religious than you are. So take us inside. What happened there that could lead Einstein whose real religion, whose deep religion \u2014 he had, as you said, a cosmic spiritual sensibility, but his real religion was a deep reverence for science and for the laws of physics. I think that it\u2019s true to say that, in 1930 when Einstein was arguing with Nils Bohr about quantum theory and God does not play dice and the whole concept of uncertainty. The uncertainty relations in the atomic world, I think Einstein was quite fired up with this very, very strong belief in the independence of truth from the human world. The world is something out there independent of human beings. And this is where he really \u2014 he and Tagore just could not see eye to eye because Tagore said, \u201CNo, no. The scientific world is still that of human beings. It\u2019s still a human viewpoint. How else do we perceive truth except through our minds?\u201D And Tagore had a sense that science was part of the human mind and indeed the cosmic mind. He believed in that. And that there was no truth that was independently existing of human beings. That\u2019s what he says and, of course, Einstein says, \u201CBut what about the table in this room? Even if we weren\u2019t here, that table would still exist.\u201D And Tagore\u2019s actually even unable to accept that. He said, \u201CYes, it would still exist, but we would perceive it through the universal mind even if not through our individual minds.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the life and modern legacy of the Bengali writer, musician and painter, Rabindranath Tagore. I\u2019m speaking with one of his biographers, Andrew Robinson. So this is actually a quote from an edited version of an article you wrote about the mathematician and the mystic, the meeting between Einstein and Tagore. You know, you said, \u201CEinstein writes this in 1930. If the moon in the act of completing its eternal way around the earth were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord on the strength of a resolution taken once for all.\u201D And his point is that we \u2014 and this gets into free will, right? And that we also do what we do with self-consciousness believing that we have some kind of choice in the matter or some kind of integrity of action. But Tagore was saying \u2014 and you correct me if I\u2019m getting this wrong \u2014 the fact that we perceive that table , that there\u2019s a sense in which that table only has a reality in human perception, that you can\u2019t write that off, that that is a form of reality and of truth, and that perhaps \u2014 didn\u2019t he say \u2014 sorry. That science also takes place in the human mind. Yes, he does, and he\u2019s in a sense more in line with today\u2019s thinking than Einstein was at that point, because of this current obsession with consciousness really, Tagore is saying that consciousness has created the universe. I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s really saying underneath it. You know, I don\u2019t want to go too far down this road, because I think Tagore himself had a \u2014 disagreement with himself when there was a terrible earthquake in 1934 in India and Gandhi made a statement to the effect that the earthquake is due to the sin of untouchability in India. I mean, he openly said that and he defended it. He defended that point of view very movingly. I think wrongly, but he did. And Nehru said, \u201CNothing more opposed to the scientific outlook is hard to imagine.\u201D And he was very shocked. And Tagore agreed with Nehru on that occasion. He said that we may depend on it, however bigoted we may be, however great our inequity, but we cannot bring down the structure of creation. Right. And he was as opposed to untouchability as Gandhi, right? Yes. I think almost as much, yes. Okay. But he said physical events have physical causes. I mean, here are some lines from \u201CSadhana\u201D? The \u201CSadhana\u201D? \u201CSadhana\u201D, yes. When did he write that? That was in the teens of the last century. So, early, early on. About 1913, I think, from memory, mm-hmm. I mean, so it seems to me that, yes, there\u2019s that contradiction. He is trying to posit a capacity of humanity, whether you call it spirituality or consciousness that has its own force, right? I mean, so here are a couple of passages that struck me. \u201CThe man of science knows in one aspect that the world is not merely what it appears to be to our senses.\u201D That\u2019s what we were saying a minute ago. \u201CHe knows that earth and water are really the play of forces that manifest themselves to us as earth and water, how we can but partially apprehend. Likewise, the man who has his spiritual eyes open knows that the ultimate truth about earth and water lies in our apprehension of the eternal will, which works in time and takes shape in the forces we realize under those aspects. This is not mere knowledge, as science is, but is a perception of the soul by the soul. This does not lead us to power as knowledge does, but it gives us joy which is the product of the union of kindred things.\u201D That\u2019s very, very provocative, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s acknowledging that there is something \u2014 there are spiritual eyes and there are some kinds of ultimate truths, right? Tagore said, \u201CI\u2019m not a philosopher.\u201D I mean, people regarded him as a philosopher, but he rejected that label. So I think his whole view of life was incredibly, profoundly influenced by the fact that he was an artist. And art, poetry and many other things, music, of course, and painting, were what he \u2014 gave him the strongest sense of joy in his life. And he felt that the artist perceived the world probably differently from the majority of other people. And that word joy, so central to him, right? It is, yes. And, you know, this last line of the thing I read a moment ago, you know, \u201CThere\u2019s knowledge that leads to power and there\u2019s apprehension which leads to joy. I think that, in the end, Tagore said that the joy matters more to him at least than the logical understanding or the idea that truth was independent of his perception. I mean, he didn\u2019t really accept that because his whole life was artistic. MS. TIPPETT: Right. There are these lines I love, I mean, essentially three lines, a little three lines of poetry. \u201CI am a poet, I do not debate. I look at the world in its wholeness.\u201D Yes, that\u2019s a good one. I just wanted to mention another one actually which is a favorite of mine, an epigram of his. \u201CThe worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.\u201D I love that . That quite goes to the heart of a lot of Tagore, I think. Yes. So tell me some more. I do sense that for you, Tagore\u2019s painting becomes just as interesting as anything else he ever did. And, you know, it\u2019s hard to talk about painting, it\u2019s hard to talk about painting on radio. It\u2019s probably worth saying, yes, how he started, though. He started by elaborating his manuscripts that he had crossed out. He\u2019d made corrections on his manuscripts. He would cross things out and then he felt they looked ugly, so he started making patterns with them with his pen and the patterns eventually grew into fully-fledged paintings and then he took up the brush. He still used the pen, but he took out the brush and started creating independent paintings. And then he started painting in earnest for the last decade of his life until 1941. And nowadays, his paintings are very sought after in India and worldwide and they\u2019re quite difficult to buy. Well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to put some of those images up on our website, because I\u2019m just longing to actually have them in front of me as I\u2019m hearing you talk about them. It\u2019s very interesting, though, that his painting grew somehow organically from his working with words. And may I say that they\u2019re not \u2014 the reason I find them exciting and also many critics do, whether Indian or non-Indian, is they\u2019re not predictably Indian. And that whole school of oriental art was rejected utterly by Rabindranath Tagore in his 60s. He said, \u201CI\u2019m going to paint from my mind. I\u2019m going to paint from my imagination. I\u2019m going to paint from my dream world.\u201D And they\u2019re almost all figurative. A few are totally abstract, but mostly they\u2019re portraits or weird creatures that existed in his mind. They\u2019re so unexpected, you know? You just would never think that Tagore would have created these, the man who wrote \u201CGitanjali\u201D and all those wonderful short stories so realistic about village life and town life and politics in India and so on. None of that is present in the paintings really. I mean, you get a sense of a man who\u2019s not all at ease with himself and certainly not \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s got demons, you know, and the demons are sometimes illustrated in the paintings. Hmm. Well, I think every mystic has demons, but they don\u2019t all put them on paper to exhibit to the world . I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. There\u2019s this thing that he\u2019s said to have said on his \u2014 no, that he wrote in 1941 which, I believe, was near the end of his life. \u201CAs I look around, I see the crumbling ruins of civilization like a vast heap of futility.\u201D And as you say, he was very outspoken about all the way through, you know, his life that things that were wrong. But then he concluded, \u201CYet I shall not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in man.\u201D Hmm. And I think that\u2019s very important. I think he didn\u2019t. Tagore didn\u2019t commit that grievous sin of losing faith in man. I mean, right to the end, the paintings show it, incidentally. But he\u2026 How did the paintings show it? Well, as light and joy and freedom in the paintings. And the people are the portraits often of very troubled people, I think, but you feel the painter\u2019s empathy with them. I think he didn\u2019t turn his back on human beings and take refuge in abstract art or the natural world. He\u2019s always interested in human beings right to the end. He had insightful things to say about all periods of life including the later years, including, you know, death itself. He was a poet with powerful ideas and a lot of experience with that subject. And I think that he has always entertained me as well. You know, his sense of humor in his best work, it\u2019s very hard to translate. There\u2019s this story that, when Gandhi wished him another happy decade on his 80th birthday and he wrote back, \u201CFour score is impertinence, five score intolerable.\u201D Exactly . But he also wrote very gripping, anguished poetry about aging. Yes. The last poems which couldn\u2019t be \u2014 they were dictated actually. He couldn\u2019t write them anymore in the middle of 1941. Yes, those are profound, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re short, but they do deal with the things that concern us all, you know, the meaning of our existence. And the very last poem you\u2019ve also got probably, that\u2019s about the, so to speak, the afterlife, although it doesn\u2019t quite use that word. That, I think, is\u2026 I don\u2019t think I have that one. Do you have that one? Yes, I do. I\u2019m not sure I read it very well, but let me just see. Okay. Uh, I do have it here in the poetry section of this anthology. Yes, this is the very last poem he wrote in English, of course, originally in Bengali. \u201CThe sun of the first day put the question to the new manifestation of life. Who are you? There was no answer. Years passed by, the last sun of the last day uttered the question on the shore of the western sea in the hush of evening. Who are you? No answer came.\u201D Biographer Andrew Robinson. You can listen again and share this exploration of Rabindranath Tagore at onbeing.org. There you can see some of Tagore\u2019s paintings and listen to music he composed, which we\u2019ve woven throughout this show. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org. Coming up\u2026novelist Anita Desai on Tagore\u2019s resonance in her life and art. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring the modern resonance of Rabindranath Tagore, who lived from 1861 to 1941. He was a polymath \u2014 philosopher, writer, painter, musician, social innovator. He was also a friend and occasional critic of his contemporary Gandhi, who called Tagore Gurdev or \u201Crevered teacher.\u201D Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, the first non-European to receive this honor. A century later, Tagore\u2019s legacy of reverence for the natural world has seen a revival in ecological circles. But much of his vast body of written work is untranslatable, or inaccessibly translated for modern minds. Anita Desai, the celebrated Indian novelist of Bengali descent, would like to change this. I wanted to just start by asking a question about you, and Tagore may or may not be implicated in your answer. And then we\u2019ll just really focus in on him. I wonder if you\u2019d just say a little bit about the spiritual and literary background of your childhood and also whether those two things were connected in your imagination growing up. Anita Desai: Well, I should tell you that everyone assumes that Tagore was part of my heritage. My father was from Bengal. And it should have been, but strangely enough, he was not. Because my father had left Bengal and settled in the north of India in Old Delhi, which is where I grew up. But when I started reading Tagore, I thought, well, he was describing my father\u2019s background. My father himself was a man of very few words, a very silent, withdrawn person, very reserved. Say some more about that, about how reading Tagore \u2014 you\u2019ve also written this, having recreated your father\u2019s world in a way that he didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t describe for you. My father had always given us just a few small hints, little stories, about Bengal which were so evocative. And when you tell them to a child especially, they tend to make a great impression. Certainly they did on me. For instance, he remembered a time living in, you know, small towns, small villages in Bengal, then East Bengal, how the postman used to walk through the forest ringing a bell to scare off tigers and he would chant, \u201CMake way for the mail!\u201D And I thought that was so strange living in Old Delhi where the post was delivered in a much more prosaic way. Chiefly, what I \u2014 the picture he created for me with these few things that he told us was of a wonderfully green and riverine landscape which would be so utterly different from arid, dusty Delhi and the north of India. It was a land crisscrossed by rivers and they used to get about by boats especially in the monsoon and the rainy season. It was the only way to get about was in a boat. Even if you were children, you could paddle the boats to school and back. And Tagore as a young man lived on a houseboat with his family and traveled up and down these rivers. And that is where he collected all the material for his short stories in particularly, because all the tenant farmers, they would come to the boat and tell him about their lives, make their requests and their complaints to him. So he had a great insight into their lives and then they were the material of so much of his fiction. I was reading in one of his biographies, you know, his family manor was in an area that was surrounded by poverty and that he was forbidden to leave it, but then, you know, as a result, he became completely fascinated with that world outside and, as you say, with the natural world. I think that two aspects of Tagore\u2019s writing that strike me very much, one is his ability to look into peoples\u2019 lives, to understand their lives with a great intensity, with great perceptiveness. And these were people who were poor, had totally different backgrounds from his own. But he had insights into them, which were so marvelous. I don\u2019t know if this is the moment where I could refer to one or two stories in particular? Yes, yes. Sure. Well, there\u2019s one little short story of his which was later filmed by Satyajit Ray and became a great classic of Bengali cinema, actually one of the loveliest films you could see. It\u2019s called The Postmaster, and it was inspired by a real postmaster who used to come and visit Tagore and bore him with very long stories. Before you go on, you did a reading of The Postmaster, didn\u2019t you for, um \u2014 I think I listened to that online. Yes, I did. I recorded it in London. Yes. And, you know, I was also struck with in that story about how there was great introspection, right? It was kind of the inner life of this postmaster, this person who had an outer life that would not be impressive and it seemed like Tagore was also really working with that reality of the depths that were hidden behind what looked insignificant from the outside in human society. Oh, yes. It think it\u2019s full of a kind of aspiration for another life, which is so prevalent in all his stories. And the other aspect which is so striking is his feeling for the unhappy situation of women in India. But then there was this other side of Tagore\u2019s writing and of his thinking which was really idealistic and spiritual and he could never block that out either. And I think there\u2019s a little \u2014 it\u2019s a tiny book, a small play, called, The Post Office, in which this is best represented. I believe I read in one of your essays that The Post Office was produced in an orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto a month before the producer and the students of the orphanage were sent to Treblinka. To a concentration camp. Is that right? It\u2019s a curious little play. Yeah. It\u2019s had a great effect upon people in different parts of the world. And where does it come from? It\u2019s almost like a little breath of air, a little breeze. It\u2019s so little, and yet it\u2019s deeply affected people. Where did it come from? How did it come about? It\u2019s about this child, Amal, who is very ill and his doctor has refused to allow him out of his room. He\u2019s confined to his bed in his room. And Tagore wrote about this with such understanding because he\u2019d known imprisonment as a child, the imprisonment of the spirit, not the body. And I think it\u2019s in this book and in this child, Amal\u2026 In The Post Office? Ms Desai: In The Post Office, that he best creates this feeling of this longing in this child who\u2019s confined to his bed, to his room, who sits at the window watching others who are free to go about. There\u2019s a watchman, Fakir, some boys, a flower girl, Sudha, and they tell him about the hills and woods and rivers where he\u2019s never been. He\u2019s never allowed to go there. And then one day he sees the Rajah\u2019s post office coming up overnight outside his window flying a golden flag and the watchman assures him that the Rajah himself would soon be sending him a letter, and Amal\u2019s longing for that vast and beautiful earth becomes intensified into his longing for that letter. It arrives and he\u2019s freed. It is a very strange book and it\u2019s had a strange effect on people, as you just said. It was produced in the Warsaw ghetto by a great child psychologist, Janusz Korczak, who knew what was happening in Warsaw and chose this play to be dramatized, acted, over there. And he accompanied the children of Warsaw when they were led to their extinction. And the other time, the play was produced, Andre Gide, read his translation of it into French over the radio in Paris the night before Paris fell to the Nazis. That\u2019s remarkable. It is remarkable because the play itself is so light. It\u2019s almost magical in its manner and yet people have seen these dark undertones to it. There\u2019s something that strikes me, that\u2019s curious about when you were talking about one of those stories that your father told you about Bengal, which were so magical kind of once upon a time place. You mentioned the postman and then these two \u2014 we talked about \u201CThe Postmaster,\u201D Tagore\u2019s short story, and then The Post Office, a little play. What is that? What did the postman and the postmaster and the post office represent? Or what do they represent? It\u2019s a very curious image for Tagore to have pursued in this way. Yes. I think it\u2019s always a message from elsewhere, from beyond, from outside that enters into your remote world, but so little ever trickles in. And every time he uses the post office, the postmaster, it\u2019s as if he has had a vision of the outside world. Tagore suffered terribly from the sense of confinement. He was always longing for freedom of light and freedom of space and he said, \u201CI cherish light and space.\u201D On his deathbed, Tagore had wanted more light. And Tagore said, \u201CIf I am capable of expressing my desire, then it will be for more light and more space.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the legacy of the 20th Century Bengali musician, painter and writer, Rabindranath Tagore. I\u2019m with the novelist Anita Desai. There\u2019s something \u2014 and you\u2019ve written about this too, how he won his Nobel Prize for literature in 1913 and he was just celebrated by people like Yeats and Ezra Pound. And you wrote that the West\u2019s fascination with him kind of coincided with, as you said, the spirit summed up in Spengler\u2019s \u201CThe Decline of the West\u201D, that notion. There was something magical about Tagore. But it also seems like there was a way in which the way people were enamored with him as a kind of mystical, spiritual writer became a way to dismiss him or reduce him. But his spirituality even in the poetry, you know, even in its purest forms, seems to me always to be connected with reality both in the form of the natural world in very concrete ways and also the human reality including these \u2014 the sorrow that is there and the injustice that is there. I think you\u2019re right and it\u2019s most obvious in his poetry. So much of it is lyrical. So much of it is in praise of the natural world and he always wanted to be surrounded by the natural world. He had a hatred of the city. He was happiest when he was out in the countryside and most of his poetry grows out of that. But he was, as you know, as anyone who knows Tagore, he was politically so aware and politically so involved. Yes, so involved, so engaged. So the real world was always pressing upon him. He wanted to be free of it, but it always was a pressure upon him and he had too much of a conscience and too much of an involvement with this country to turn his back on it. But when he was alone, when he was by himself, he always had this dream of escape. I\u2019m also very struck by how much a poet who so loved the natural world to whom a leaf, a tree, an insect meant so much was also preoccupied so much of the time with death and how often death seems to have visited him, beckoned to him, wanted to take him away. Well, he had a lot of death. I mean, he knew a lot of death in people he loved as well, it seems, all the way through his life. Yes. He knew a great deal of tragedy in his life from the time that he was a very young boy and tragically in love with an older sister-in-law. She was only 18 and she committed suicide and I don\u2019t think he ever got over that because, as an old man in his 70s, when he picked up the paint brush and started to paint, it was her face that he would paint over and over and over again. And then in his lifetime, he lost his wife, he lost several of his children and he knew death. And yet his belief that death in some way completed life, brought meaning to it, and that is a pain that he wrote about and used a lot of the time. Yeah, there\u2019s, um, some of the things that really struck me, that he wrote these amazing lines about really about age. I mean, I guess it was a period when he was close to when he died. Just this way he was so engaged with that experience, I guess, and articulate, you know, and poetic about it. I don\u2019t know if you \u2014 there\u2019s this poem. It\u2019s called \u201CRecovery.\u201D \u201CBrutal night comes silently, Breaks down the loosened bolts of my spent body, Enters my insides, starts stealing images of life\u2019s dignity, My heart succumbs to the assault of darkness. The shame of defeat, the insult of this fatigue grow intense.\u201D That is such an incredible way to write about, you know, just this bodily experience of illness and aging. Yes. I think he did write it when he was dying, and yet he was still in complete control. He was able to articulate everything about that experience that few of us are able to imagine or write about. Yes, and so even in describing, you know, as he says, the indignity, the insult, he makes something beautiful of that, you know, of that description. Yes. And another thing that strikes me so much about his old age and his decline \u2014 physical decline was that his spirit remained almost childlike in its vitality. One of the very last poems he wrote, one of the very strangest poems he wrote, he said: \u201CToday I imagined the words of countless languages To be suddenly fetterless, After long incarceration in the fortress of grammar. Suddenly up in rebellion, maddened by the stamp, stamping of unmitigated regimented drilling. They have jumped the constraints of sentence, To seek free expression in a world rid of intelligence, And he goes on about the way these words have broken free and are galloping all around him and dancing\u2026 Free from the bonds of grammar. Yes, even the bonds of grammar. And he ends it: \u201CIn my mind I imagine words thus shod of their meaning, Hordes of them running amok all day, As if in the sky there were nonsense nursery syllables booming \u2014 Horselum, bridelum, ridelum, into the fray\u2026\u201D Imagine a dying man, one of the last things he wrote, was of this amazing fantasy of freedom. Right. You know, it\u2019s interesting, isn\u2019t it? I mean, one of his biographers, um, in this biography that you actually wrote the foreword to, said, you know, \u201CTagore\u2019s found everywhere in Bengali life and yet he is lost.\u201D And, you know, I learned in particular from your writing that, I mean, is the Indian national anthem a song that he wrote? Is that true? Yes. The Indian national anthem and the Bangladeshi national anthem too. Yes. Yes. And also that every Indian school child recites this poem of Tagore, \u201CWhere the Mind is Without Fear,\u201D which is beautiful. I want to ask you about this. You\u2019ve mentioned this in a few essays, but you always say, \u201Cevery Indian school child recites, however reluctantly , \u2018Where the Mind is Without Fear.\u2019\u201D Is that reluctance just because this is something memorized? Because it\u2019s compelled. It\u2019s a compassion. Every child must learn this, yes. If a child were to come upon it on his own, of course, it would have a very different effect. But if it\u2019s prescribed, then one doesn\u2019t see it in quite the same way. Do you know it? Do you have it in front of you? I don\u2019t have it with me. I\u2019ll just read it. \u201CWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action \u2014 Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\u201D It\u2019s a prayer. It is a prayer and, of course, Tagore was writing that as a patriot and he was also writing it as an educationist. That was the other aspect of his life. He so much wanted to change education the way it was in India. He wanted to set students free. He\u2019d suffered himself at the hands of very unimaginative teachers and a very unimaginative way of teaching. There seems to be practically no aspect of life that he didn\u2019t try to touch, to alter, to somehow bring around to his ideal of how things should be. And, of course, they so often ended in tragedy, that you would think he would have become a very cynical man at the end of his life. But I think he had far too much compassion and far too much imagination to ever allow himself to become truly cynical. There\u2019s these words he spoke on his 80th birthday. \u201CAs I look around, I see the crumbling ruins of civilization like a vast heap of futility, yet I shall not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in man.\u201D It\u2019s true. He very rarely mentioned God, that\u2019s not a word that he \u2014 that figures in his vocabulary. He really believed in the divinity of man, or the divinity that man is capable of, although so rarely achieves. Although I was fascinated to read that when Gandhi was fasting, again within his campaign to eradicate untouchability in the 1930s, that Tagore traveled to be with him and that he led the group in prayer when Gandhi broke the fast. I read that he read these lines from his book of poems which won him the Nobel Prize. It\u2019s beautiful again. \u201CWhen my heart is dry and parched, come with a merciful shower When grace has departed from life, come with a burst of song.\u201D I think that must be the most wonderful reverence anyone could have shown Gandhi. It would surely have stirred him deeply. It must have meant a great deal to him. What does Tagore mean to you? I mean, let me just kind of ask a question. How does his imprint on the world, you know, Tagore\u2019s legacy which continues to roll around in the world in many forms? I mean, how does it nourish you in your 21st century life? I do think that he must be the most Indian of all Indian writers. As I say, I was never made to read Tagore as a child. Yet, when I started writing, and this was before I had read Tagore, I was writing on many of the same themes, the confinement of women, the denial of freedom, of free thinking to women especially. And also the fact that, if you do pick up Tagore, if you can bring yourself to overcome a resistance to that definitely Victorian, old-fashioned, out of fashion, manner of writing now, you do break through to a mind that is so vast and so complex that it really does ask of one a new way of study, a new way of finding how to relate to his work. Perhaps it\u2019s also a particularly Indian way of thinking and being and writing and speaking that we all do share. Anita Desai\u2019s novels include include Clear Light of Day, The Village by the Sea, and Fasting, Feasting.
