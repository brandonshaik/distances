  "fullText": "Years ago, I gained a whole new understanding of the Exodus story with the celebrated Torah teacher Avivah Zornberg. And it was a thrill to sit down with her this year in her living room in Jerusalem. She doesn\u2019t so much teach the Bible as inhabit it. She participates in the ancient Jewish tradition of Midrash, of reading between the lines of sacred text to uncover deeper, hidden layers of meaning. And she creates an experience of these depths \u2014 intellectually, spiritually, sensually \u2014 for modern people. The whole tenor of the language is about human life, and God has to find his place. And that\u2019s why he commands the building of the tabernacle later on. That is, in some sense God dwells in this world. And it seemed to me that the human language that God is obliged to use is actually, that\u2019s the house he lives in. He\u2019s willing to accept a kind of lower dwelling place because of what can happen. From APM, American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being, \u201CThe Genesis of Desire.\u201D Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg grew up in Scotland, but has lived in Israel for the past 40 years. She is wise about modern literature and psychology. The daughter and granddaughter of rabbis of East European lineage, she\u2019s also steeped in the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah and its pivotal text, the Zohar. She connects deep and unexpected currents between the Bible and the lived situation of the reader. So, for example, the character of Noah in Genesis. On the surface of this story, God sees a world that has become corrupt and violent, and resolves to flood and destroy it. But he commands one man, Noah, to build an ark to save his family and two of every living creature. In the depths of this story, Avivah Zornberg finds a drama about language and civilization. The real crisis of human beings is she says that \u201Cthey have become so open that they are closed to one another.\u201D Correspondingly in a way, she and I enjoyed speaking about such things for the first time in person and not by way of technology. This is very different from the studio recording . Yes, and I remember what was so remarkable is just I remember just in the end I put my notes to one side and opened up the Bible and we were just walking through Exodus. So did you think about a text or story or a couple of stories you\u2019d like to \u2026 There are a number of possibilities. I mean, one possibility that I\u2019m very fond of is the Eden story, Adam and Eve and God and desire and so on. Another is the Flood. Actually, almost everything I\u2019ve written about is important to me. Yeah, why don\u2019t we do the Flood and see where that takes us? The Flood, I feel, is one of these stories that\u2019s like a cartoon story for people, right? They think they know it. It\u2019s a myth in the negative sense. Yeah, exactly, in a negative sense, it\u2019s very flat and in fact, I mean, I loved reading what you\u2019re writing about the Flood and all the layers. Where is it anyway? I should have marked it. Chapter 6. Chapter 6, all right. So what\u2019s happening there? Ah, what\u2019s happening there. I mean, everything is happening. I think whatever you can read in the text is happening. What I\u2019m interested in is the issue of language and silence, a kind of defensive silence, and the basis for this apparently very modern theme actually is in the Zohar, in the source of Kabbalah. It\u2019s a mystical tradition of Judaism. Mystical traditions which talk about the beginnings of humankind as an experience of what\u2019s called the exile of the word. Exile of the world. Galut hadibur in Hebrew, as if it\u2019s not just people who go through physical tribulations, but in some way people lose their access to language and have to refind it. Does this loss of connection to language, does that have anything to do with the fact of the Flood happening, the reason the Flood? OK, let\u2019s go back to there. It\u2019s a good idea to start at the beginning. The Flood, the idea, the word that\u2019s used for Flood, mabul, is an idea of a surging mass of water, of confusion, of chaos. What happens in the Flood is that there is a return to a pre-created universe, to the universe before. Without form. Yes, without form and void, which means specifically then without language. In Hebrew, again, it\u2019s very graphic. It\u2019s tohu va-vohu. And tohu va-vohu, even the sound of it is like a kind of babble, a sense of \u2014 a babble of waters and the need to control that and in some way give form to that, and that is all lost when everything is destroyed, when everything is flooded. That would be almost like the metaphysical implication of something very physical. And that void is also larger than the loss of language, right? I mean, is it the loss of connection then between human beings? The loss of encounter and relationships? Well, I think by language, the tradition means dibur is not simply the technical act of language. It\u2019s communication, it\u2019s connection, it\u2019s everything that saves the individual and the world from being closed up in oneself. I was just thinking this is a completely different connection, but I think it works. It\u2019s in the Midrash conversation I had recently for the show with a philosopher from Princeton who \u2014 we were talking about civility in the United States, civil conversation and civil society which is a problem for us right now. He was wanting to resurrect the word \u201Cconversation\u201D in, as he said, a more old-fashioned sense of not just words passing between people, but human familiarity like shared life, association. You\u2019re actually describing something very similar. Absolutely. I think that\u2019s very beautiful. It reminds me of Milton discipline in one of his prose essays, his polemical work where it\u2019s actually defending marriage, describing marriage. I think he uses the expression it\u2019s a meat conversation, meaning it\u2019s a right kind of conversation between two people. By that, he doesn\u2019t mean words. He means a whole life, yes. So then we\u2019re with Noah, Noah being confined in his space. That\u2019s right, which the Hebrew word for ark, again, is tevah, which is a box, and that sort of gives you the picture that actually he is boxed in. Very interestingly, the word tevah also in later Hebrew means the word. It\u2019s the word for the word which the Zohar will play with. The Zohar will have things to say about that, but essentially it\u2019s a prison, you know, it\u2019s a floating prison in which the seeds of a new civilization are preserved and it\u2019s an extremely unnatural life that\u2019s lived in that box. Right. Again, the Zohar and Midrashic sources go to town on it. I mean, they really have a lot to say about that. That\u2019s interesting too because we never \u2014 when that story is told to children, for example, I think it\u2019s mostly children who hear the Flood story \u2014 we never reflect on the life in the ark. You get the two by two coming on and then coming out at the end. Yes, yes. So how does the Zohar \u2026 The Zohar and Midrashic sources \u2014 first of all, how did they all eat? How did the animals eat? It\u2019s a big \u2026 Right . Yes. I mean, all right, maybe they brought on food for the animals, but how did they get at it? So Zohar imagines very beautifully that Noah spends his whole time, morning and night, day and night, feeding the animals. That\u2019s an expression of his desire to preserve the world. And he feeds each animal according to its own timing, it\u2019s own feeding schedule, so he\u2019s really rather fully occupied feeding the world. He doesn\u2019t get a wink of sleep, again, in these Midrashic sources. He has no sexual relations with his wife and no one does. There is no sex. Even the animals on the ark, you know, don\u2019t have relations. Well, right. It would get crowded if they added. Again, so none of this is in the text. None of it, but it\u2019s hinted. The hint is \u2014 it\u2019s really a hint where God says to Noah, \u201CYou come onto the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your daughters and her daughters.\u201D In other words, people are listed gender separate. You and your sons, not you and your wife, but you and your sons, and the women separate. And what you have is a necessary measure for survival, a kind of empty flood period, is about a year, which really counters all the madness and the fusion of things in the waters. But then when the time comes to get off the ark and God says, \u201CTsay menehteva\u201D \u2014 you know, leave now \u2014 he says, \u201CLeave you and your wife.\u201D And by leave, therefore, not just get off, you know, get onto the plank and walk off, but he means return to a human way of living, which means you and your wife dibur, speaking, the human thing, and he leaves with his sons and, again, the women separate, which means that he doesn\u2019t really agree to leave, that there is something about that setup in the box that, in a strange way, suits him, because it seems to him in some way simply safer. And that way, of course, the end really lies. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Genesis of Desire\u201D \u2014 we\u2019re exploring hidden meanings in sacred text and the \u201Cbiblical unconscious\u201D \u2014 in Jerusalem with the great literary interpreter of Torah, Avivah Zornberg. In her book about Genesis, The Beginning of Desire, she elaborates on rabbinic readings of the character of Noah. She writes: \u201CNoah is indeed a man of his world and his time. He shares in the prevailing pathology; he is saved more for what he may be than for what he is \u2026 (W)e have only to consider this central fact of his silence. From the beginning to the end of the Flood narrative, Noah says not a word. Noah tells his interlocutors, \u2018God intends to bring a flood on the world, and told me to make an ark, so that I and my household may escape.\u2019 It is not surprising that he is not effective in swaying his contemporaries. His silence is the reverse image of their babble.\u201D What fascinates me is Noah\u2019s lack of love for life. Something is lacking in him and it\u2019s called the lack of the word. It\u2019s called the exile of the word. One way that the Zohar points it out very vividly is that, when God says to Noah, \u201CYou get onto the ark with your wife and so on and everyone else will die,\u201D Noah says not a word to God. He\u2019s silent. He doesn\u2019t answer at all, he doesn\u2019t pray for the people of the world, and that occupies the very center of the narrative for the Zohar. The Zohar thinks of that absence of intervention. It\u2019s true that even though Noah in his sense is a heroic character because, for reasons that we don\u2019t quite grasp or that are not spelled out, he\u2019s the one person who is saved. He\u2019s not very three-dimensional. He\u2019s rather enigmatic, yes, yes. You don\u2019t see heroic qualities in him. No, you don\u2019t, and the expression is that he found favor in the eyes of God. And that almost sounds, especially in the Hebrew, as if it\u2019s a kind of irrational preference on the part of God. And that\u2019s in the text all the way through, isn\u2019t it? It really is. It\u2019s also of David as well. The idea of liking, you know. The people just like each other and God also likes people. For some reason, God sees possibilities in Noah, but it\u2019s not spelled out in terms of solid, you know, character qualities or anything like that. But when you describe that way in which Noah is in a kind of prison, but he seems to have a comfort level with it, whether that\u2019s reflected or not, which then impedes his capacity to live fully in the world, to grow up, I mean, that is in fact an image of life, right? I mean, we each have our prisons. I mean, it would be like also this imagery of the difference between a victim and a survivor comes to mind, and you\u2019re kind of describing that. I mean, being a victim, one can get very comfortable in that. Absolutely. And on top of that, I think precisely the things that he can\u2019t do in the ark or he mustn\u2019t do, like sexual relations, sleeping, the way he spends all his time feeding, it occurred to me that these are descriptions of God. God feeds all living beings and God doesn\u2019t sleep. He doesn\u2019t slumber nor sleep and God, of course, has no partner. So in a sense, there\u2019s a kind of omnipotence that Noah is experiencing in this prison, which is, again, very natural that, once you have deprived yourself of life and you see that in some way as an ideal and as an expression of ultimate power because you are not compromised now in any way by the messy world of talk, of communication. So to me, it\u2019s a defense mechanism and he refuses to let go of it. And that\u2019s, again, a very common human image. I think so. Yeah, so how does this come alive for you in a very modern life and an Israeli life? I tend to think and imagine on an individual basis rather than in terms of collectives, although I could see how one could easily apply this politically. But what interests me most actually is the life of the human being in an existential sense and how tempting that pathology of the exile of the word is as people, you know, in a way become megalomaniac about how only my view is the right view and, therefore, conversation in that larger sense becomes not only unnecessary, but really dangerous. I mean, in the end, he becomes drunk. Noah? Noah becomes drunk, so there\u2019s a kind of intoxication that comes of that kind of solipsism and depression, actually. I mean, I see it very much in modern psychological and psychoanalytic categories that it\u2019s an unwillingness even to admit that one\u2019s lost something and, therefore, one is not prepared to mourn what one has lost. So really one is caught in a state of closure that holds no hope at all. It\u2019s an impossible situation, but a situation that\u2019s very human. I think this is also an example of how the Hebrew Bible preserves a picture of the messiness of human life. It\u2019s there in the holy text. Yes. I was having a conversation the other day with someone here in Jerusalem, and he was saying that that\u2019s become so much more and more important to him as he\u2019s moved through his life. I think it\u2019s a bit foreign for Christians. I mean, Jesus is such a perfect, but not very three-dimensional, figure. I mean, there\u2019s so much that we don\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s not known that the text really doesn\u2019t address \u2014 truly doesn\u2019t address and there\u2019s not this tradition of Midrash. But even the most heroic figures, like a David or like a Noah, the one man who\u2019s saved, are flawed. These are not fairy tales with happy endings. And even God himself, I mean, that\u2019s really going very far and a traditional reading of the Bible would hesitate before going this far, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling especially in these early stories that God in a way is modeling to people \u2014 that aspect of God which can be known by human beings \u2014 is modeling to people how not to be Godlike. In other words, that God behaves in a way that is not entirely Godlike and takes the risks of that, as if to model to Noah and the other characters the possibilities of error, the possibilities of what you call messiness, and how that actually is part of the dance. It\u2019s part of the dynamic of a world that\u2019s informed by desire, which is God\u2019s world. God desires \u2014 God himself desires. He desires there should be a human being in the world. He says, \u201CLet us make\u201D in some way diminishing his omnipotence. And the Jewish tradition emphasizes that, that these are ways in which God connects with us because he connects with our issues of omnipotence and of the necessity for a different approach. I think you also talk about desire animating the reader. Yes, yes. There\u2019s a desire for the text. Yes, absolutely, yes. I mean, reading the text half asleep is basically is nothing in the Jewish tradition. Is not really reading the text. You know, you don\u2019t read; you study. You study the text and that implies that you don\u2019t really understand it, first off. You read it and then you read it again and then you notice things and things don\u2019t work and things don\u2019t make sense and then you\u2019re exorcised by it. And that\u2019s what I call desire, because something is not. Something that should be there is not there and that\u2019s what gets people going. That\u2019s what gets people involved and this very intimate connection between the human being and the text, between Jews and this text, is a result of that. Talk to me a little bit more about the notion of desire. It\u2019s a very evocative word, but the way you\u2019re using it has many layers that are not necessarily there in a cultural reference to desire. So take me inside that word, I think, maybe by how you see it come to life in the text or in other sources. Yes. Well, I\u2019d have to go back to the Garden of Eden in that case. And this innocent little sentence that \u201Cthe Lord God took Adam and placed him in the Garden of Eden,\u201D which when you come to think about it, doesn\u2019t make sense. Where was he before the Garden of Eden? You tend to assume loosely that that\u2019s where he was created. Nope, he was created somewhere else and then God took him. So Rashi, who is the prime commentary on the Biblical text \u2026 Rashi is one of the great commentators, Midrash \u2026 Yes, 11th century, yes. He uses Midrash a great deal, so he has this wonderful comment on the word \u201Cand God took him.\u201D His implication, what\u2019s behind it, is that how do you take a human being? You can take an object and move it from here to there, but how do you take a human being? And he says, \u201CHe seduced him with words. He seduced him with beautiful words.\u201D Actually, the word for seduction is used. He moved him, you know, he lured him with beautiful words to enter the Garden. That is, he couldn\u2019t take him by main force, could he? Well, of course, he could, but God doesn\u2019t do that, as it were. When it says God took, it he means that he moved him to want to go, and why does God want him in the Garden of Eden? Because God has some kind of a desire that he wants to see played out in the Garden of Eden. God desires something about human beings and, in the Midrashic literature, what God desires of human beings is simply that human beings should desire him, and that\u2019s like a delicate matter. You know, how do you effect someone else\u2019s desire? You can\u2019t force because that\u2019s obviously not going to work. And therefore it becomes a question of what\u2019s called seduction in a positive sense. Seduction is something we can\u2019t live without. You know, we\u2019re seduced by a sunset, we\u2019re seduced by a smile. Life is full of seductions. Some are more healthy than others, but you can\u2019t be without seduction in a live world and you can\u2019t be without desire. So God presents himself throughout the story of the Garden of Eden, I think, as someone who has desires, that he has desires and he wants human beings to be a little less, again, android-like, a little less robotic and to discover the world of desire which they don\u2019t have at the beginning \u2014 at the very beginning. They\u2019re just perfect. They\u2019re made just perfect. Everything fits in place. You can\u2019t have desire unless something is lacking? Unless something is lacking. The next generation will have parents and will already be born into what you call the messy world and there\u2019s something about that that God wants, that God loves, because it produces desire. In her book The Beginning of Desire, a reflection on Genesis, Avivah Zornberg summons some lines of the poet Wallace Stevens, from his \u201CNotes Toward a Supreme Fiction.\u201D The priest desires. The philosopher desires And not to have is the beginning of desire. To have what is not is its ancient cycle. It is desire at the end of winter, when It observes the effortless weather turning blue \u2026 It knows that what it has is what is not And throws it away like a thing of another time As morning throws off stale moonlight and shabby sleep. This is the sixth and final program we\u2019ve created from our rich spring trip to Israel and the West Bank. At onbeing.org, find all those shows: with philosopher and Rabbi David Hartman; Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh; Israeli journalist Yossi Klein Halevi; Mohammad Darawshe, an Arab civic leader of Israel; and voices from the Aida camp, a Palestinian refugee camp and neighborhood in Bethlehem. Together they reveal many faces of Israeli and Palestinian identity \u2014 and humanity. Again, that\u2019s at onbeing.org. Coming up, more on the story of Eden, which means, in Hebrew, \u201Cdelight\u201D; also Avivah Zornberg on the \u201Cbiblical unconscious.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being: \u201CThe Genesis of Desire\u201D \u2014 in Jerusalem with Avivah Zornberg. She is a celebrated interpreter of the Jewish Torah \u2014 the foundational first five books of the Hebrew Bible. She moves poetically between modern literature and psychology, ancient Jewish mysticism, and the Midrashic art of reading between the lines of sacred text to discern its fullest meaning. \u201CThe Bible is familiar,\u201D she\u2019s written. \u201CLife is strange. We bring the two together, to shed light on life.\u201D Years ago on this program, I experienced the Exodus story in a completely new way with Avivah Zornberg. Now I\u2019m with her in her living room in the Old Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem. We started out talking about Noah and the Flood. Now we\u2019ve walked backwards in the book of Genesis, to the story of Adam and Eve. This biblical first man and first woman live peaceably and pleasurably in the Garden of Eden, naming the world into being, meeting God in the cool of the day. But in a passage that puzzled me in the Sunday Schools of my childhood, Adam and Eve are banished after they eat the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. God has invited them to eat from every other tree, but warned that if they eat from this one, they will die. I remember when I first started knowing how to get inside these texts, I was fascinated by the notion of delight in the Garden of Eden, that Eden means delight, that it\u2019s all over the place. Yes. Actually once you start \u2014 again, I don\u2019t think a word people associated with the Bible. So God has created this delightful place, the food is delicious, right? Everything is beautiful and, as you say, perfect, perfectly suited to their needs. And then there\u2019s an irony there, isn\u2019t there, that because it\u2019s all perfect and beautiful and delicious, they don\u2019t know desire, which then it turns out that they can\u2019t be complete without that. Yes. Then, of course, in the difficult ways that things always happen, their first real meeting with desire is through the snake, through the serpent, who comes with his evil seduction, you know, with his disturbing seduction, and they\u2019re not equipped to know how to deal with it. Eve is not equipped at first, so she allows herself to be seduced by the serpent and then she seduces her husband. She seduces Adam, so it\u2019s a whole \u2014 suddenly there it is. It\u2019s a world that\u2019s full of unruly impulses. And what I see as a wonderful turning point is when Adam lies to defend himself when God asks him, \u201CWhere are you?\u201D when he\u2019s hiding in the garden. Adam answers, \u201CThe woman that you gave me.\u201D He blames. Yes. \u201CShe gave me of the fruit and I ate.\u201D And that\u2019s when we\u2019re really embarrassed, you know, because we identify somewhere now. Oh, I recognize this. This is human, human in an embarrassing way. We don\u2019t want to acknowledge that that is who we are. And what I suggested and what seems to me very plausible is that it\u2019s not exactly a lie. He\u2019s saying the truth. His wife did give him the fruit and he did eat. He\u2019s ignoring many things, but I think what he\u2019s doing actually is saying two things at the same time. On the one hand, he\u2019s in a way confessing that that\u2019s the truth. This is what happened. At the same time, he is trying to justify himself. He\u2019s trying to pass the buck to Eve and that, I think, is the moment of humanity. That\u2019s when we really start talking. About who we are and what we\u2019re like. About who we are, yes, yes. Alex Brodsky said, \u201CConsciousness \u2014 human consciousness begins with one\u2019s first lie.\u201D Because that\u2019s when we begin to be aware of the complexity in ourselves and the different impulses. And that\u2019s where poetry comes from as well. You know, not only bad things come from saying two things at the same time. As long as you have a kind of straight, unequivocal, immaculate version of things, there can be no poetry and there can be no tension, no desire, again. The desire makes itself felt when language comes alive. How do you think about the meaning of knowledge? Right, it\u2019s the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Let me just say something that I was struck by and as I learned to read this, but I want you to open it up and take it in another direction, if you will: that, for one thing, I think, to a Western mind, there should be something wrong with knowledge, that God should forbid knowledge is offensive and strange, strange for the faithful and the problem with religion for the unbeliever. But the knowledge that Adam and Eve gain is petty. I mean, it\u2019s not evil. It\u2019s not catastrophic. It\u2019s like they know that they\u2019re naked where, as before, they were very happy, and they know how to lie and they know how to blame. What is that word, the knowledge? What is the image in the Hebrew? Well, you know, when sexuality begins properly between Adam and Eve, the word that\u2019s used is va-yayda, that Adam knew his wife. Right, right. And is that the same word as the tree of knowledge? So I can\u2019t help thinking it\u2019s not theoretical knowledge that we\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019re talking about consciousness in its fullest sense and intimacy. And again, it has to do with communication and language, and God wants it actually. The knowledge, consciousness. He wants that to happen. There might have been better ways for it to happen, but it happens in this way and perhaps, in the end, it\u2019s not so clear that God wasn\u2019t opening the sluice gates in a way to all that because, without that, God drives Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden after that. It seems almost as if a new period has to begin now in which the bliss, what you call the total pleasure \u2014 the French have this lovely word, jouissance, which I think of for Eden. That total bliss has to be, in a way, moved out of. There is a kind of divorce from that kind of relationship with God, that kind of relationship between man and woman and into something more complicated. And even that relationship with the natural world, which is very evident these days. With the natural world, yes, yes. And there is an ideal somewhere in Jewish thinking of ultimate return to the Garden of Eden, but clearly it\u2019s not a return to the same way it was because, once you\u2019ve been through experience, you know, you return to innocence in a very different way. Yeah, so I think knowledge really has a lot to do again with desire and, in fact, one of the great commentators, Nachmanides, translates the word as desire. The word knowledge? The word knowledge here, the tree of knowledge of good and evil he understands as the tree of desire for both good and evil. That is, the capacity to love and to hate, he says. Before, there was no loving and no hating because it was just \u2014 everything was in a way unequivocal. So it seems to me that what you\u2019re describing kind of harkens back to this larger theme of almost a maturation process of God\u2019s relationship or God\u2019s desire for what human beings might be, their relationship, how God might build that relationship. I mean, I don\u2019t even know how to say it. So I was thinking after we were talking about Noah a minute ago, just as I was turning the page as we moved to Genesis and I saw, as you said, there was this moment, in this effort, Fox translation, which tries to stick closer to the Hebrew, he says, \u201CAnd God was sorry he had made them.\u201D But it\u2019s almost like what you\u2019re describing is a learning process on the part of both God and humanity. Yes. I have to confess that I have a little reservation about that kind of language about God. It doesn\u2019t come smoothly to me. Which language? The language of God learning. OK. And the way in which I\u2019ve come to think about it, I know this is part of \u2014 is the way people do talk now, that God learns especially in the Flood story and he changes his mind and he realizes no more floods and so on. The way in which I\u2019ve come to terms with it is to think of God as a character in the story who obviously cannot be perfect. As a character in the story, he can\u2019t be omniscient and omnipotent and the way the story is told, in fact, makes that clear. The God who, according to Jewish tradition, has written the story is like the author vis-\u00E0-vis the character. And the God who transcendentally is at the back of the God who writes the Bible is yet again another stage further away from projections of various kinds. But the God in the story itself, God has written a story about himself as a character and that character, yes, learns. He learns because he wants to teach human beings to learn. Somewhere there\u2019s a kind of modeling there, which may be very far from, you know, an official education agenda. You know, it\u2019s not necessarily an educational project. It\u2019s just something you can\u2019t help picking up as you are reading. It\u2019s more of a creative process. It\u2019s a creative process, yes. So when I was first thinking about theology, I was also writing fiction and reading people writing fiction. You know, we use so many metaphors too think about God, and the one that\u2019s most readily at hand is God as Father. But I\u2019ve thought about, you know, God as author. You know, people who write creatively often describe how their characters, if their story comes to life, they lose control even though they are the writer. Yes. I think loses control, as you say, as a human writer loses control, is not exactly losing control. It\u2019s actually discovering forces that were not explicit before, that were not fully \u2014 and suddenly they find these forces and these ways of creating things suddenly become real. So in that sense, it\u2019s losing control in terms of a neat, unmessy package. And losing control in the sense of having to interact then with the other three-dimensionality \u2026 Again, again the idea of language. Yes. That once words are used, then they are inevitably human words and God has to use human words. However divine the words are, they\u2019re clearly a restriction on his infinite power, and it\u2019s a blessed restriction in some ways because it makes a world possible. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Genesis of Desire\u201D \u2014 in Jerusalem with renowned Torah teacher Avivah Zornberg. You often bring literature, not religious literature, just literature into your Midrash in a way, I think. Is that fair to say that? Something very moving for me when I finally read the Genesis story closely was this image of God planted a garden in Eden, land of pleasure, which is how Everett Fox has translated it. This idea that \u2014 and I can\u2019t find it. It\u2019s repeated a couple of times, I think, of Adam and Eve living in this land of pleasure, meeting God in the cool of the day. There\u2019s this proximity, and then there\u2019s an echo of that, which is sad or nostalgic in a way, after they are expelled from the Garden. And God has done this, right? There\u2019s just this one line. It\u2019s Verse 21, Chapter 3. \u201CYahweh, God, made Adam and his wife coats of skins and clothed them,\u201D which, as you said before, they didn\u2019t have parents, which means they couldn\u2019t be fully human, but this is a very paternal gesture and they\u2019ve been punished and then they are clothed. A very tender gesture, yes, yes. In fact, typical again, in this case, I think it\u2019s Talmudic source that says from here we learn that we should clothe the naked. In other words, we learn from God\u2019s actual behavior, which in a way is kind of un-Godlike, you know, that God should be involved in such physical things as actually clothing people. But the whole tenor of the language is about human life and God has to find his place. What came to mind again when I thought about that was the beautiful expression that\u2019s used about God, that he looks for a dwelling place in the lower worlds and that\u2019s why he commands the building of the tabernacle later on. In some sense, God dwells in this world and it seemed to me that the human language that God is obliged to use is actually that\u2019s the house he lives in. That\u2019s the dwelling place of God, that he\u2019s willing to accept a kind of lower dwelling place, a place that doesn\u2019t really suit his grandeur, because of what can happen once the lower worlds are acknowledged to have God in them. And so you\u2019re not just thinking about our texts, but the texts included. I mean, the texts included, the written texts, the sacred texts. The sacred texts, yes. That, but not that only, yes. I mean, that\u2019s an interesting way to think about how powerful this kind of text is and yet flawed. I mean, not enough \u2014 not enough \u2026 It needs reading and reading. In a way that maybe it\u2019s perfection, but it\u2019s a perfection that goes via apparent imperfections and the energy that\u2019s created them of the reading process is much more important than having a perfect text, whatever that might be, which I think is actually an impossibility. I don\u2019t know what a perfect text would be. But I also mean you might think in the abstract that if human beings are encountering the word of God, that that would be enough to live by and to live to get it right. And I think that that, again, for outsiders to our traditions would point at the fact that there\u2019s supposedly the word of God, but then humanity is humanity, the way you\u2019re describing it. Of course, it doesn\u2019t suffice. There\u2019s no failsafe. There\u2019s no password to the good life in a text. It\u2019s all alchemy. It\u2019s all how we incorporate the text, what we do with it. And again, that word, that language, is life. It\u2019s not just words, not just speech. Well, I think speech is involved very much in it, but, yes, I mean, the Torah is life. It\u2019s a plain statement, you know, that is made. The Psalmist makes it in different ways. And it\u2019s life in its most immediate. People who are imbued with the text, with a bit of biblical text, it\u2019s always in their minds in some sense or other. That is, things are always floating up. Words are always floating up and completing things and opening things up, so you sometimes see. This is one of my memories of my father on Jerusalem bus, you know, sort of getting onto the bus and sitting next to some other bearded character and the two of them just beginning to have this cryptic conversation in which, you know, there would be one quotes and another quote, kind of \u2014 barely opening their mouths, just communicating sort of underground. No one else could have told what they were talking about, but they were talking at depth. The title of your most recent book, The Murmuring Deep, so evocative. Does that point to that depth you\u2019re talking about? Just describe what you mean by that phrase. I suppose by the The Murmuring Deep I mean the living and rather disturbing being of the universe, what was called the deep, the tehom, at the beginning of Genesis, that the spirit of God hovered over the face of the deep. The idea that might not have been a silent deep, but actually it might have been a murmur or a moan or something coming up from there, which in a way had to be interrupted in order for there to be speech. Light had to come into the darkness and speech had to come and disturb that very disturbing sound, which is a kind of sound of basic life which is always there nevertheless, as far as I can understand it. Underneath all the words we say, what we are really communicating with on some primal level, an elemental level, is, I suppose you could say, the unconscious or things that cannot be put into words, which are also part of communication. It\u2019s also part of what we convey to one another. All right. You say, the biblical unconscious. Your reflections on the biblical unconscious and what you\u2019re kind of describing is that biblical unconscious meeting the human unconscious and the strange and essential things that happen in that meeting. Yes, and that\u2019s really the joy of reading. I think that we are not solving riddles when we read the Bible, but we are responding with everything that\u2019s in us and we trust that there is enough there to meet that. What else? Anything you want to say as we finish? Anything that\u2019s come to you that you want to bring in? Any image or story? I think what we are doing now is an example of what we\u2019re talking about, that there are all kinds of desires at work in this kind of conversation and that adds a richness to what officially is going on. Sort of guesswork, like what are you really saying? What am I really saying, and so on. As precise as we try to be, we never quite say it, and that\u2019s what makes it interesting. That\u2019s what makes it exciting. It\u2019s that dialectic between strangeness and familiarity that you also describe. Yes, yes. And without the strangeness, you know, it should be a very dull affair. It wouldn\u2019t really give birth to much. Avivah Zornberg, thank you so much. Thank you. I enjoyed it.
