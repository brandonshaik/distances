  "fullText": "Keith Devlin sees mathematical equations like sonnets. They are reflections, he says, of the inner worlds of our minds. But what most of learn in school doesn\u2019t begin to convey this. And that\u2019s not just because some of us \u2014 like me \u2014 seem congenitally bad at math. Our brains are not primarily logical, but analogical. And what we\u2019ve asked everyday math to do up to now can be better done by computers.Keith Devlin is also a leader on the frontier of MOOCs, massively open online courses. And he believes that on-line teaching is helping us finally learn how we learn. To be with this mathematician is to glimpse the beauty of \u201Cmathematical thinking\u201D \u2013 illuminating what it means to be human in unexpected ways. Just as a trained musician who can read music can look at a musical score and in their head \u2014 in their mind \u2014 they can hear that music playing. For a mathematician, the same thing is true. Providing it\u2019s in a part of mathematics you\u2019re familiar with, you can look at those symbols and in your mind, this mathematical world is created. And you can see the flow and ebb of ideas; you can see it going on. It comes to life in your mind. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Keith Devlin co-founded and directs H-STAR at Stanford University, the Human-Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute. He\u2019s also a senior researcher at Stanford\u2019s Center for the Study of Language and Information. He grew up in England, in Kingston upon Hull. Were you born, bred, raised in Yorkshire? Is that right? Yeah. I was born in Hull, in what apparently was the worst snowstorm of the decade, in 1947. So I had a very exciting, melodramatic entry into the world. Which you don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t recall, no. But my mother, who is long passed away now, she told me of the difficulty getting a midwife in and the doctor and anything. The lady next door actually delivered me because nobody could get out. There were snow drifts outside the house of several feet deep, apparently. And were you drawn to math, mathematics, pretty early in your life? Uh, no. Not at all. I used to like playing soccer and rugby and rough-and-tumble things. It was sort of a classic, working-class childhood. The mathematics came much later. The only role model I had in the family of anyone who sort of had a degree and a professional career was an uncle by marriage, and he was a chemist. His house was full of books, he would travel around, he had an extensive collection of jazz records, and he lived the life of an intellectual. So my first introduction to anything to do with science or technology or learning in general was to chemistry. But that was pushed sideways a little bit. Just when I was about to or just when I started at high school, Sputnik went up. So I sort of began to sort of think in terms of physics. Once I decided I was going to go into physics, then of course I realized that I needed to be good at mathematics because that was the key to physics. I want to ask you this: There\u2019s such a contrast between the way, not just the way you speak about mathematics, but the way you, define it. And there\u2019s such a contrast between that and the \u2014 well, I\u2019d say, the understanding and even the experience of mathematics that so many people have right at that age of school, and then maybe never have another experience. Yeah, that\u2019s right. If the last experience you have of mathematics is what you learned certainly up to the middle level of high school, and to a large extent even right through the end of high school the way it\u2019s taught, you\u2019ve basically never seen mathematics. And so most people in the world haven\u2019t a clue what mathematics is. Right. So let\u2019s talk about some of the ways that you \u2014 just reading you, your imagination is \u2014 starting with one definition is the science of patterns. Yeah. I was actually one of the people who really pushed that in the 1980s. I mean, psychology is the science of patterns of the mind; sociology is the science of patterns of social interaction. So you could call anything the science of patterns. What makes it mathematics is the kind of patterns you study and the methodology you use. But the reason I pushed it was to very much get away from this idea that it was about calculation and computation. It\u2019s nonsensical, but it needed to be done; it needed to establish itself as different. More recently, I\u2019ve actually started using the phrase \u201Cmathematical thinking.\u201D I\u2019m giving one of these Massive Online Courses from Stanford \u2014 I\u2019m about to give it the third time. Yeah, I want to talk about that in a little while. We\u2019ll come back to that, but the thing to note is, I don\u2019t call it the Introduction to Mathematics; I call it the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, to say this that isn\u2019t about computation and calculation and solving equations. It\u2019s about thinking about the world in a certain way that we have learned over the centuries is extremely powerful. Not the only way, not the best way, a valuable way. Hmm. Yeah, I mean, here\u2019s another definition that you use variations of a lot: that mathematics is a \u201Cvast and beautiful mental landscape that generations of human beings have created over 3,000 years.\u201D A mental landscape. And that\u2019s what stumbled \u2014 that\u2019s when I became a mathematician; that\u2019s what I stumbled on at age 15 or 16 when here I was learning all this mathematics because I needed it. I had a utilitarian view of mathematics. I was learning it because I needed to solve the equations because I was going to be solving them in physics. And then, at the age of about 16 or 17, it all fit because it all came together in my mind. It was no longer this disjointed collection of techniques you could use to solve problems. It all fell into the place, into this wonderful landscape. It was as if I\u2019d been stumbling around in a forest, and suddenly I\u2019ve climbed to the top of a tree and looked out and thought, this is the most beautiful place in the world. You can\u2019t tell it when you\u2019re down in the trees, which I had been, but the moment you reach an elevation where it all falls into place and you can see the whole topographic display in front of you, then the beauty is incredible. And the moment I discovered it, I said, um, I want to study mathematics. And I\u2019ve been studying it ever since. Right. This idea that also what you saw, what you work in, is not just about the physical world or about abstract equations but the inner worlds of our mind? And that, in fact, that numbers \u2014 and this is such an interesting point you make \u2014 that numbers are abstractions, that they only exist in our mind than what we do with them. Yeah. There\u2019s a strong feeling that you have when you do mathematics that it\u2019s actually a sort of an objective reality, that the numbers \u2014 it\u2019s known as the platonic realm. It sort of goes back to Plato\u2019s writings and ideas \u2014 that you\u2019re discovering things that are in this sort of ethereal world out there. And in a sense, that\u2019s the case. But when you start to dig deeper, you realize that that ethereal world itself has been created by generations of human beings. And so mathematics exists as a psychological and a social construct. Which means that when you\u2019re doing mathematics, you\u2019re actually \u2014 even if you\u2019re doing mathematics about quarks or electrons or whatever it is, superstrings \u2014 if you\u2019re doing mathematics about physics or something in the world, in some sense, yes, what you\u2019re doing is learning more about the world. But in a deeper sense, when you\u2019re doing mathematics, what you\u2019re really learning about is how the human mind encounters and makes sense of the world. It\u2019s really a mirror. So mathematics in some sense is a lens through which you look at the world. But in a deeper sense, it\u2019s a mirror through which you look at yourself in a very abstract and penetrating way. And I know this is frustrating to you, because when you describe it that way, it feels so essential to who we are as a species, right? That somehow, each of us should have some sense of that, even if we\u2019re not professional mathematicians. Or, you know, this line of Galileo that you also evoke often, that language is \u2014 sorry, that mathematics is the language in which nature was written, which the universe was written. And then there is the great question about why we don\u2019t really \u2014 most of us don\u2019t walk around knowing this. Because no one\u2019s told us. And it\u2019s hard to see it unless someone opens the door for you. I was lucky. I discovered mathematics in spite of my education, as most of us, I think do. Occasionally, you come up against a really great math teacher that can open your eyes. In my case, I didn\u2019t have bad math teachers, but their view of mathematics was the same as everybody else\u2019s. It was a utilitarian subject that you need to know. But they prepared the groundwork, helped prepare the groundwork for me to make that discovery. You know, I have no \u2014 I\u2019m one of these people who gave up on myself mathematically a long time ago. But I interview a lot of scientists, a lot of physicists and astronomers. I have to say, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve interviewed many pure mathematicians, but I\u2019ve interviewed people who use mathematics. And so what I\u2019ve come to, and I think also my listeners come to, is an appreciation, you know, I think it may be too late for many of us to actually grapple directly with mathematics, but to start to understand the importance of this as part of who we are and as part of the universe. I mean, I think one of the ways you talk about this and have worked with it that does help to bring it down to earth a little bit is some of the connection you\u2019ve made between language and mathematics. Could you talk a little bit about that? Yeah. You know, people get turned off mathematics in various ways. If you teach it as sort of just stuff you need to know to balance your checkbook \u2014 which is nonsense because none of us balance our checkbooks; computers do that for us. On the other hand, because language is so important to us as living creatures, everyone is interested in language one way or another, be we language mavens or just interested in listening to the radio or reading or novels. You know, language is a fundamental part of what we ask. In fact, in a book I wrote in 2000, called The Math Gene, I actually made a case based on sort of rational reconstruction of human evolutionary development, I made the case that actually mathematics and language are actually two sides of the same coin in terms of evolutionary development. Human beings, when we developed the capacity for language \u2014 and nobody knows when that was; it might be as recent as 50,000 years ago \u2014 but when our ancestors developed language capacity, at that moment they developed the capacity for mathematics. It\u2019s the same capacity. It just plays out in different ways. Hmm-mm. Hmm-mm. I\u2019m just thinking, in my own family, I had a grandfather who had a second-grade education, but he had this prodigious capacity to do things with numbers in his head. You know, it was completely mysterious. Yeah. Completely mysterious. Not taught. I don\u2019t think he had any clue why he could do it. And then, I have a son, now, I\u2019ll say, who\u2019s 14 \u2014 he\u2019s doing well in everything but math \u2014 and he said, \u201CMy brain just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201D You know? And I think he\u2019s not the only kid who says that. I think I probably said that at some point. So then, in the context of that, I\u2019m reading you and this sense that there\u2019s something innate in us. And then why does that not make itself manifest? It\u2019s true. Everyone is on a spectrum, with physical abilities, mental abilities. We\u2019re all on a spectrum. But a lot of the problem in mathematics is that an awful lot of what goes on in the school system is basically trying to train the mind to do what a $10 calculator can do: follow rules and algorithms and procedures. And one thing that we do know is, that the human brain does not find that natural. The human brain is analogical, not logical. And so, when we try to force it to be procedural and exact, the brain simply doesn\u2019t like it. It was important for many thousands of years to be able to do computation and calculation because that was the basis of commerce and trade and buying and selling. And you had to do it in your head or with an abacus board or something. So for hundreds of years, it was actually important to train the mind to follow rules to do computations and get the right answer. Well, now we\u2019ve automated that. And we carry around devices in our pockets that can do that. Which means that we can spend more time letting the brain do things that the brain is really well suited for that computers can\u2019t do very well: making value judgments, making analogical leaps. The trouble is, the education system is at least 50 years behind the changes in technology in society. Right. That takes me back to you saying in the beginning that you don\u2019t talk about mathematics but about mathematical thinking. And what we learn in school is that old-fashioned, narrow idea of mathematics. But you\u2019re saying \u2014 that that\u2019s not natural to learn, as you say, to come up with the right answers. But how interesting that could be if, even at a young age, we were offered the invitation to do mathematical thinking. Yeah. It\u2019s as if you went along and you said, I want to be an architect. And you go to architecture school and the first five years they teach you how to lay bricks accurately, in nice straight lines. You know, taking advantage of being an architect does depend on the fact that people can lay bricks. Right. Bricklaying and architecture are not the same thing. And mathematics is the architecture, it\u2019s the creative stuff you can do with these bricks. And it\u2019s no longer necessary for people to be able to lay bricks themselves because we now have machines that handle the bricklaying for us. Right. Right. Right. Actually, so do builders. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with mathematician Keith Devlin. I want to talk to you about something else, another connection that you shine a light on an interesting way that\u2019s always been very intriguing to me, which is the connection between mathematics and music, right? Like we all know that that connection is there, but I\u2019ve never really been able to comprehend it. I\u2019m not sure I can comprehend it now, but, again, I feel like you open this up in an interesting way. One place you said, the most beautiful equations are like sonnets. Yeah. Yeah. And you said that mathematics and music are both captured in dry symbols, but they both come alive when interpreted by the human mind. Yeah. Certainly in the days when the only way to store and distribute music \u2014 before recording devices \u2014 was to write it down in symbolic notation. Then, of course, if you couldn\u2019t master that notation, you couldn\u2019t get to the music. Mathematics is still largely still like that. And maybe always will still be like that. It is still a hurdle that you have to master mathematical notation to get to the mathematics that it encodes. But just as a trained musician who can read music can look at a musical score and in their head \u2014 in their mind \u2014 they can hear that music playing. Yeah. For a mathematician, the same thing is true. Providing it\u2019s in a part of mathematics you\u2019re familiar with, you can look at those symbols and in your mind, this mathematical world is created. And you can see the flow of the ebb of ideas; you can see it going on. It comes to life in your mind. And take in the beauty of it, which is a word that you and a lot of mathematicians use constantly. Yeah. And so you see through the symbols to what they\u2019re about. Just \u2014 the interesting thing is, I don\u2019t read music. So to me, music is just . I can really resonate with people who can\u2019t get mathematics from looking at a book, because I can\u2019t look at a musical score and hear the music. Yeah. Someone has to interpret it for me, to play it. So, you know, you did this interesting project a couple of years ago, called \u201CHarmonious Equations,\u201D which I had so much fun discovering. That was a hoot, yeah. [music: \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity\u201D Yeah. And I think we\u2019d like to layer some of that music into this production. Oh, please do. Yeah. So let\u2019s just talk about a few of those. So there\u2019s this \u201CEuler\u2019s\u201D \u2014 is that how they say it? \u2014 \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity.\u201D You know, again, it\u2019s very intriguing language at the supreme level of abstraction, \u201Cseemingly different concepts sometimes turn out to have surprisingly intimate connections.\u201D And then, as you narrate, the numbers that are part of that equation, you know, what becomes clear to me \u2014 even though I don\u2019t understand this \u2014 is there is kind of a world within each of these numbers. Yeah. And then you talk about them becoming a perfect mathematical composition. Right. Right. Absolutely. Say a little bit about what \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity\u201D is for someone who doesn\u2019t know. Yeah, because I do work for the media and things, I always get asked the question: what is your favorite equation? What is your most beautiful equation? So even though, in a sense, the scientist in me says I don\u2019t have a favorite, I love them all \u2014 that\u2019s like saying you love all your children, that kind of thing. That\u2019s right. I actually always give an answer and my answer is always \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity.\u201D And that\u2019s certainly a justifiable one, from my point of view. There were very few basic constants in mathematics. So you\u2019ve got these five most fundamental constants: zero, which has to do with addition; one, which has to do with multiplication; \u03C0, to do with geometry of circles; e, to do with natural logarithms; and the square root of negative one, which is to do with algebra. And given that they\u2019re coming from different parts of mathematics, or so it seems, there should be no reason why these things connect together. But it turns out, there\u2019s the most beautiful, elegant identity that connects them together, which says that e raised to the power i times \u03C0, plus one, equals zero. You\u2019ve got an equation \u2014 each one is mentioned once, all it involves is a plus sign, an equal sign, and an exponentiation sign and multiplication sign for the i and \u03C0, and you\u2019ve got this identity. There\u2019s no reason on the face of it why that should be the case. I remember when I first met that, as a teenager, I was completely blown away. I mean, if anything could have come close to convincing me that there was this thing called God out there, that was surely it. \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity\u201D is an instantiation of the fact that what we thought previously were separate things actually always were, within the realm of mathematics, part of the same whole. As with good art, not only does it reveal \u2014 not only does the beauty, the intrinsic beauty of the equation itself \u2014 in this case, not the beauty of the symbols but of the logical connections between them, the elegance of the connection between them. So it\u2019s beautiful on that sort of technical level, but it\u2019s also beautiful because it tells us \u2014 it\u2019s a great insight into the world. You know, just like the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile captures an awful lot about being a human. And you can \u2014 I mean, people discuss endlessly what was going on in her mind, assuming it was a she that was the model, what was going on in that person\u2019s mind when that painting was done and what did the painter capture. Well, it\u2019s the same with \u201CEuler\u2019s Identity.\u201D It tells you an awful lot about the mathematical world that we\u2019re exploring. Mmm. It\u2019s an absolutely beautiful piece of art as well as a beautiful piece of mathematics. Mmm. That\u2019s wonderful. Thank you. And then in the \u201CPythagoras\u2019 Theorem\u201D \u2014 this is another piece that you commissioned with these musicians. I just want to ask you about this statement that you made. Pythagoras said that \u201Cnumber is the ruler of forms and ideas and the cause of gods and demons.\u201D And you took that phrase as the theme for the song. So what did he mean by that? What do you understand in that statement by Pythagoras? Uh, well we\u2019ve got to go back and put ourselves in the mind of Pythagoras. It was sort of mystical; it was a secret society. There was also sort of a cult element to it. One of these things about mathematics \u2014 this comes up when people talk about things like the golden ratio and all this kind of stuff \u2014 is that even people who don\u2019t have professional mathematical ability, there\u2019s a sort of fascination with number. Yeah. I\u2019ve written many times about the golden ratio, because people say that the golden ratio has also all sorts of wonderful properties, most of which are completely false and bogus and have nothing to do with the path. It\u2019s not the dimensions of the most perfect rectangle \u2014 it\u2019s all complete nonsense. So you ask yourself, why do people get so passionately involved with number? And they do. And the only answer to that I can come up with is that deep in our psyches, we know that the world we now live in, the lives we lead, depend in a fundamental way on the discovery and the invention of numbers, just as they do on language. Most people don\u2019t publicly acknowledge that number is part of what we are. But I think deep down in their psyche, they know we were. But there\u2019s some mystery to it. The fact that we don\u2019t understand it makes it mysterious \u2014 makes that intuition mysterious. That adds to it. Absolutely that adds to it. But we all sort of know that they are important. And I think that goes back to what Pythagoras was saying. Even back then in the days when it was sort of more cultish, folded in with religious beliefs and all kinds of things, even back then, people realized that numbers were a big, big deal. And I think that\u2019s what Pythagoras\u2019 quote was referring to. You can listen again or share this show with Keith Devlin at onbeing.org. There we also have links to more of his favorite equations set to music with the choral group Zambra. There are musical odes to Leibniz\u2019s series for pi and Einstein\u2019s energy equation. Coming up\u2026how teaching thousands of students online can be more intimate than a classroom.I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: with mathematician Keith Devlin. We\u2019ve been exploring his view that what most of us learned as math in school doesn\u2019t convey the beauty and purpose of this endeavor. We\u2019re catching some of his delight in mathematical thinking \u2013 as something that reflects the inner world of the human mind and can help us navigate the outer world in unexpected ways. Keith Devlin leads Stanford University\u2019s H-STAR: the Human-Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute. I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about this, the H-STAR project at Stanford that you\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s interesting the different kinds of things that you\u2019ve gotten involved with, even at Stanford alone: the study of languages \u2014 the Center for the Study of Language and Information, now this H-STAR project, which focuses on, as I understand it, the human applications and ramifications of technology. And I\u2019m finding that this is a subject everyone wants to talk about now, kind of the enormity of the role of technology in our lives is settling in. The reality of that and our understanding of that. And then people are saying, you know, what do we do with this? I mean, how do we make sense of it and how do we make it purposeful and livable? I mean one of the things that you \u2014 really surprised me that you mentioned this, in terms of mathematics, is that computers have only really affected mathematics around the edges. That, in fact, mathematics still needs free-form scribbling to survive, which is so interesting. I mean, mathematics takes place in the human mind, or increasingly, when human minds interact together. We still have this nice romantic image of the lone mathematician working in the attic late at night. And those people still exist. But if you sort of look at mathematics as a whole enterprise, it\u2019s a huge enterprise, then an awful lot of mathematics these days, like everything else, is done collaboratively in teams that communicate both by physically co-locating themselves at conferences and seminars and workshops, and collaborating over the Internet. But it\u2019s still about people talking to and with people. And the technology \u2014 other than the fact that we use email and things like that, video conferencing \u2014 the technology is still not really affecting the product itself. It\u2019s just around the edges. And I really do think that you have your finger on a pulse of this, this disconnect \u2014 let me just say it this way: that, you know, on the one hand, as you and I have been discussing, many of us, I think most of us are illiterate in the language of mathematics. And then there is the increasing reality that the indispensable tools of our everyday lives, you know, starting with our mobile phones, as you say, rely on masses of abstract math. Yeah. So we\u2019re living with these things, we need these things, we can\u2019t begin to grasp what\u2019s behind them. Yeah. The scale of that has gotten huge, but actually, that began with the very beginnings of mathematics because arguably mathematics began \u2014 and I would say this is when it began \u2014 with the invention of numbers. And we think that took place in Sumeria about maybe 8,000 years ago. And numbers were introduced essentially to provide as a form of money. Numbers were things that mediated trading goods. The moment that we invented numbers, we did it to introduce into interpersonal reactions into society, to introduce abstractions that could mediate. Because numbers are pure abstraction, money is an abstraction. I mean, a $10 bill is just a physical manifestation of the number 10. I mean, that\u2019s all it is. You\u2019ve just got a physical token of 10, and you\u2019ve got a mental token of 10. And nowadays, we have bits on discs in banks. I mean, we don\u2019t even need the $10 bill. It\u2019s just a configuration of bits on a computer. So we are mediated in terms of the kind of life we lead, the length of our lives \u2014 almost everything about our lives is mediated by money. And money is just numbers and numbers are abstractions. And all that has happened recently is the scale has gotten much bigger and the rate of change has been faster. But our lives became irrevocably changed and bound up with numbers the moment we invented numbers and money, about 8,000 years ago. Hmm. And we\u2019ve gotten used to that. And people actually don\u2019t think of money as abstract. No they don\u2019t. They don\u2019t. I\u2019m old enough to remember when credit cards came along, and I do remember that initially there was a lot of unwillingness to go to a credit card because people wanted dollar bills. In my case, it was pounds and coins \u2026 It wasn\u2019t real money. \u2026 and so, but now we\u2019ve gotten used to that. And then, of course, when you start having mobile phone transactions and things, you don\u2019t even need the credit card anymore. You know, you just go in and you wave your mobile phone in front of a scanner. So, and the rate of change has gone up dramatically, and the extent has gone up, but it\u2019s actually not a new phenomenon. We are more aware of it because we are living through the latest transition. You know, this is \u2014 this is kind of tangential to that, but it feels a little bit related. One of the interesting ways you talk about how mathematics has evolved is that across history, there\u2019s abstract math going on, which has no conceivable application at the time in which it\u2019s being done. But, for example, you talked about how encryption systems that now run the Internet followed on work with prime numbers a couple of centuries ago, at which time it was outlandish to imagine that these things would ever have practical applications. And now, fundamental aspects of our reality depend on them. Yeah. In fact, one of the leading people, G.H. Hardy in Cambridge, actually went on record in a book and said \u2014 he was quite \u2014 because someone had challenged him about the fact that you can use these things for practical uses in mathematics. And he said \u2014 he went on record as saying, nothing he had done in his professional career could ever find practical application. And by golly, within a hundred years, this is the basis for the Internet in modern society and security. So, if there\u2019s one thing history tells us, it\u2019s never, ever look at something and say this will never be used because in the case of mathematics, time and time again things come around and get used. I\u2019m actually of two minds about this. I\u2019m always surprised and I think, \u2018Wow, this is what Eugene Wigner described as \u201Cthe unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.\u2019\u201D We develop mathematics to be useful in the first place, and so at first it is obviously going to be of use. But then we sort of follow our intuitions, we go off on these tangents, we pursue these abstract ideas, and we end up producing something that just looks like a pure art form, just having no connection with reality, to whatever. We\u2019ve let our imaginations run free, subject to the constraints of mathematical logic. And we produce these new theories and their beautiful and their entirely coherent and they don\u2019t seem to have any application. And then, a hundred years later, maybe longer, someone comes along and finds a really important application. So part of me says, that is absolutely surprising. On the other hand, if you go back to the point I made earlier, that mathematics is just really looking at the way the human mind encounters its environment, then if that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, you should expect that things we develop \u2014 even though we can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s going to be relevant now \u2014 will eventually be relevant. Because what it really tells us is, at the time we\u2019ve done that mathematics, we haven\u2019t developed as a society or individuals to the point where we can appreciate what we\u2019ve just seen. Mmm. We have to catch up with our own \u2026 We have to catch up with it. Interesting. And so, in a sense, it\u2019s not a mystery; it\u2019s just part of what mathematics is and how it works. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today with Stanford mathematician Keith Devlin. Stanford has been a pioneer of MOOCS, Massively Open free Online Courses. And Keith Devlin has been one of the first professors to join in, offering \u201CIntroduction to Mathematical Thinking\u201D to thousands of students at a time, all over the world. So tell me about these Massively Open Online Courses you\u2019re doing. I mean, what is it like to teach 27,000 people. It\u2019s like going on the radio and talking to however many million people we\u2019re talking to now, actually. I\u2019ve always been driven for various reasons towards trying to spread the word \u2014 there\u2019s a sort of evangelical streak in me here \u2014 just to spread the word \u2026 Absolutely. You are totally a mathematics evangelist. I know that. But whenever there\u2019s a new communication medium, I sort of look at it and I can\u2019t resist seeing if I can use that \u2014 or how I can use it, I know I can use it \u2014 how can I use that to communicate mathematics? You do it in different ways. You know, the way \u2014 in a movie, you do it one way; on TV you do it a different way \u2026 Hmm-mm. And in a text book, you do it one way; And so I gave my first MOOC a year ago. And I changed it a bit and gave it again in the spring of this year. And in September this year, I\u2019m going to give it a third time in a third incarnation. And I think education, to me \u2014 I approached the MOOC the same way. It\u2019s not about me talking to 100,000 students, it\u2019s about me talking to one student. In fact, in many ways, I find MOOCs more intimate than giving a lecture to a class of 30 students. And most of my time, I give lectures to classes of university students of maybe between 15, 25, 30 students sometimes. And I give big lectures to sort of a few hundreds of students. But those are very impersonal. They are theatrical displays. But part of doing a MOOC is you\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s you and one student, because by its very nature, it\u2019s one person, sitting at a computer in front of a screen, interacting with you. Now, the interaction is mostly one-way, but part of the trick of putting these courses together is to compensate for the fact that the student can\u2019t directly address you back. Now in a big class of 100 students the students can\u2019t do that either but they have TAs and they can interact with each other in the classroom and so there is a lot of interaction going on. With a MOOC, the challenges are more acute, when you think of individual students in remote places who aren\u2019t even in the same classroom as other students and don\u2019t have access to anyone to ask questions for. That makes it a very interesting thing to design. And most of the mathematics is done with a cheap little camcorder mounted on a tripod above my desk. Mmm. But I did go into the campus TV studio here and spend an exhausting six-hour period, actually, recording all of the intercam punctuations, which actually, if you look at them \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about mathematics. I\u2019m establishing human contact, by looking into that camera, eye to eye, looking at that student. Because it was all about establishing human connection and getting them to feel comfortable with me as their friend and instructor. Hmmm. I\u2019d kind of like to take you back to the book you wrote in the late \u201990s, Goodbye, Descartes: The End of Logic and the Search for a New Cosmology of the Mind. Ah, yeah. I mean, I found that really wonderful book, and you \u2014 you know, one of the things you were pointing out is that just in about the last 300 years, we\u2019d glorified rational thought and logic in a way that had not been done before in history. Even in the history of science, kind of treating our minds as calculators. But that we\u2019re now getting this much more sophisticated understanding of our minds and brains and learning and intelligence. And then the reason I thought that I would like to talk to you about this now is, you know, that was I think \u201996 or \u201997. So here we are these decades later and these decades of rapid transition and rapid new fields of knowledge about, in particular, our brains and our minds and our bodies. So how would you look now at this notion of, you know, what the world looks like beyond logic, beyond Descartes? Yeah. Well, if anything, what I\u2019ve said, what has happened since then, is simply reinforce the feelings I had then. It was interesting the transformation that led me to write Goodbye, Descartes. It was very expressly goodbye to the sort of Cartesian logic based approach to life. In a sense, I was finally renouncing my former self. Because I went into mathematics \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t think I was ever a sort of total Platonist. But I went into mathematics seduced by the fact that the power of the logic of the reasoning. And in the 19th century, mathematics ruled supreme as the basis of physics, of engineering, calculus, all the more, economics. Mathematics literally built the modern world. To the degree where people in mathematics, including myself, began to think, well, we\u2019ve got this powerful mechanism. We can take it into the realms of psychology, sociology, linguistics, and start to make sense of these soft sciences, you know. And kind of solve every problem with this logic \u2026 We can certainly try to solve every problem. That had already been tried a bit a few decades early by the people who try to build artificial intelligence systems and expert systems. And in both cases, they had very limited success but not great success. But you know, undaunted by that, I thought, well, maybe we can do it in natural language, understanding language impulses. So when Stanford founded its Center for the Study of Language and Information in 1983, I got very interested and came out as a visit in \u201985. Now, what I didn\u2019t expect was that when I got to CSLI, I would be brought face to face with all these psychologists, these linguists, these psycholinguists, these social linguists, sociologists, the etymologists. I was brought in with all of these people in what I used to call the soft sciences \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 as opposed to the hard sciences, and thinking \u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t so naive I would be able to say, here\u2019s some mathematics; it will make your discipline a little more robust. Although, some of my colleagues seem to have that belief. I was prepared to sort of be taught new things. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for, but what happened to me, was I ended up realizing the huge limitations on mathematics in those domains. And this happened to Chomsky when he tried to sort of do the same to linguistics in the \u201950s. Right. And it became clear there were \u2014 it was good stuff and lots of stuff has come out of it, but it wasn\u2019t coming close. It was like trying to reach the moon by building taller and taller ladders. That was not the way. Didn\u2019t mean to say that you wouldn\u2019t get to the moon, but you weren\u2019t going to get there by building a ladder. And building the ladder that got us to the moon certainly involved a lot of mathematics. And building the ladder that would involve us to understanding \u2014 sort of really understanding people and society, mathematics can certainly play a role. But it\u2019s not the rule of the king and laws that it was in physics. It\u2019s the rule of a trusted worker who can provide stuff as and when it\u2019s needed. We needed to stop trying to build mathematical ladders that would help us reach this moon of understanding of human beings and society, and simply view mathematics as a tool that could play a useful role in a more broad and holistic interdisciplinary study that would help us to understand it. Along with that, came, in my case, the final acknowledgement that mathematics isn\u2019t the discovery of an external platonic realm, that it\u2019s actually the building and study of a realm within our own minds. I mean, I don\u2019t know if you would think of this in this context at all, but it seems to me that in this century, you know, and as late as 2008, with the economic downturn, the crisis, we\u2019ve kind of lived more deeply into this recognition that \u2014 that we, that we had called things rational that weren\u2019t rational, right? That \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 this principle of logic and pretending that when numbers are involved it is logical. Somehow, it was in precisely those systems \u2014 our financial systems, that work with numbers \u2014 that turned out to be these monuments to irrationality. And then, suddenly, there\u2019s this recognition also in the field of economics, which I think had had that Cartesian view that somehow at bottom, this is all rational. That, in fact, this is what you\u2019re pointing out as well: we\u2019re getting a more complex sophisticated understanding of ourselves from a lot of different directions. Yeah. Yeah. And ultimately, mathematics is black and white, and the world that we live in is an infinite variety of shades of gray. I mean, mathematics can work in localized ways and be useful. And it can also provide interesting metaphors to help us make decisions. There\u2019s all sorts of great uses mathematics has in sort of making sense of today\u2019s world and building the world of tomorrow from it. But as I said a moment ago, the days of the 19th century, when mathematics ruled how you built your machines and how the machines worked, those are gone. And if anything, the financial crisis was a great warning that says, if you build systems based on mathematics, you are heading for disaster. This circles back to this business about NSA and security. Those systems are built on mathematics. And they, if not checked, they will lead to disaster every bit if not worse than the financial crisis \u2014 for the very same reasons. Because mathematics works when you\u2019re talking about a clockwork mechanical universe; it doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re talking about a human society. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the world we live in. It\u2019s so important. And I also do want to circle back to your love of mathematics. And, in fact, you know, it\u2019s very interesting to me the spiritually and theologically evocative way, the aesthetic way, that physicists and mathematicians speak of mathematics. There\u2019s this quote of the English mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell that I\u2019ve seen you use a few times. I\u2019m just going to read this because it\u2019s very beautiful and I hadn\u2019t seen it before: \u201CMathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty. A beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.\u201D Yeah. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? Yeah. Actually, as you were saying that, I remembered your very first question was, you know, when I was a child, do I have \u2014 am I spiritual. And I actually tangented off immediately to talk about not having religious beliefs in a sort of white-bearded god in the sky, and that kind of thing. But I mean, the reality is, of course, that I\u2019m deeply spiritual. It\u2019s just that my spirituality is in mathematics and through mathematics understanding ourselves and the place we have in the environment we\u2019re in. So in the sense \u2014 if spirituality means revering existence, revering my fellow creatures on the planet, reflecting in them, thinking about them\u2014 in my case \u2014 through the eyes and the mind of a mathematician, then I\u2019m as spiritual as it gets. And you know, if that manifests itself with poetic language and overblown use of language, then that\u2019s just the price you pay for that spirituality. How do you think this work you do, this life you lead, this mathematical thinking with which you move through the world \u2014 how do you think it forms your sense of what it means to be human or affects the way you live your life? I see the world differently from anybody who\u2019s not a mathematician. In fact I see the world differently from many mathematicians. So, in some sense, I\u2019ve seen things that other people are not seeing. But I think it\u2019s almost \u2014 actually, I guess I have to use the words \u201Cshades of gray,\u201D although that\u2019s been co-opted for a different purpose these days. But anyway, I think we all see the world through shades of gray. There\u2019s a period \u2014 when most of us learn mathematics, there\u2019s a period in our early career when we\u2019re in our teens or 20s, when we think that mathematics provides the black-and-white view of the world \u2014 the view of the world. I remember distinctly having that view because it seemed to be so logically correct. Now it is logically correct more so than any other discipline, but the question is, at what cost for connecting to the rest of the world, especially the human social world. So there\u2019s that period. But then you go beyond that \u2014 or you should go beyond that to realize that mathematics is just another shade of gray that gives you a different perspective on the world. But it\u2019s still the same world. The grayer world to one person is not that much different from the grayer world to another . So this really is my last question. Is there any frontier, right now, that you\u2019re aware of, where new things are being learned or new processes are being experimented with that you are watching \u2026 Wow! Where do we begin? Well, just tell us about one thing that\u2019s unfolding that you\u2019re really watching with great interest. Oh! It\u2019s the one that I\u2019m right in the middle of, which is online learning. Not because of the fact that we\u2019re reaching thousands of people. We\u2019re finally beginning to understand how people learn. Here\u2019s an analogy: If you went back to the 18th century and you got sick, good luck, because you might find somebody who was instinctively a good doctor or who was lucky, but medicine was just hit and miss by then and depended on talent and whatever it was, on luck. Because it took the development of, first, chemistry, then biology, evolutionary biology, and the developments of modern science on which we can ground medical training. So, when you go to a doctor today, the chances are that person is going to make you well, providing you at least have a recoverable disease, because we\u2019ve learned the science on which medicine is built. Science in 200 years, science went from hit-and-miss hunches to a scientifically grounded discipline where the chances were very high that the doctor would be able to help you and make you well. Right now, in education, we are in the 18th century. We are actually, I think, within a couple decades \u2014 of being able to actually improve mathematics education to the point where people actually do begin to get it and get over the hurdles. Because we\u2019re beginning to understand it better.. Education is now starting to make that transition, to the fact that, yes, there\u2019ll be good teachers and bad teachers and better teachers and worse teachers, but it will all be grounded in understanding. And in the process of understanding how we learn, we are, of course, doing what mathematics has been doing since the very beginning. And as I\u2019ve been saying, we\u2019ve been learning about ourselves. Because the more we learn about how we learn, the more we learn about what it is to be human.
