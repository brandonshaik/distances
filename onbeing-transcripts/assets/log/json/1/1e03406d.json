  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today two stories of war and surprising acts of reconciliation that followed. Bruce Weigl will take us into the terror and the beauty he found in Vietnam. But first, the story of four chaplains and nearly 700 other men who died on the troop ship Dorchester off the coast of Greenland in February 1943, the third largest American loss of life at sea in World War II. He eventually got his orders to go overseas and it was a very difficult goodbye, and I looked at him through the windows of the train, and I was crying and he was crying, and I knew I\u2019d never see him again. At a time in America when religious identity kept Jews, Catholics and Protestants apart, these four chaplains of different faiths gave away their life jackets, linked arms and went down together praying with the soldiers who could not leave their ship. David Fox is founder and director of the Immortal Chaplains Foundation, and he has interviewed the surviving veterans of the Dorchester. The story of the immortal four chaplains begins with, of course, the four men themselves. And they were unique in that they were all of different faiths and came together on this boat, a US troop ship called the Dorchester. And they were Clark Poling, who was a Dutch Reformed minister from upstate New York; and then there was Rabbi Alexander Goode, who was a rabbi out of Washington, DC; my uncle, who was George Fox \u2014 he was a Methodist minister up in Vermont \u2014 he actually had three parishes at one time and was called a circuit rider even then; and last was the Catholic priest, Father Washington from New Jersey. And they met on the Dorchester at the end of January 1943, and the \u2014 I interviewed the first sergeant of the ship who was on deck at the time when the four of them met. So that was interesting because I actually got to experience what it was like to know what they were like when they got together, and \u2014 and he explained that they were immediate friends. They just sort of hit it off together, and they started laughing and joking, and they had a \u2014 a bond almost immediately between the four of them. On board, the chaplains began to organize entertainment for the men, and the men would tell me in the interviews I did that they were always together and that was remarkable for them. Was that their job? Yes, it was their job to \u2014 to provide stimulation for the men, things for them to focus on other than knowing that there was a submarine out there, and they soon found out that they were, in fact, being trailed by submarines. So the chaplains kept their spirits up, they organized a talent night and apparently the chaplains were the biggest hit themselves. They were quite talented singers \u2014 I think all four of them were. And Rabbi Goode, Alexander Goode, was also the son-in-law of another rabbi, Rabbi Jolson, who was the father of Al Jolson. Really? Yeah. So he had considerable connections to show business, so they became very \u2014 very popular on the ship. Rabbi Goode, he could sing with the best. He would hold his services as the others hold theirs, and we all went to all of them. We were on a ship. We had nothing that we could go, and so when they had services we went. Lots of times they were together, they were going around and trying to keep morale up. And they all worked well together; they seemed to fit right in. But I just felt closer to Father Washington. He see \u2014 just seemed right at home even in the atmosphere of a troop ship. There was a couple of fellows playing cards, and Father Washington came wandering through shortly after I got in there. I was watching the game. He came over and he stood behind a fellow. And this fellow turned around to him, he said, `Father, would you bless my hand?\u2019 He looked at it and he said, `I should waste my blessing on a lousy pair of treys?\u2019 I \u2014 I thought that \u2014 that was just like him. The captain had just said that there was five \u2014 at least five submarines trailing us. They picked them up on radar, you know, and they said if you \u2014 they hit you \u2014 that\u2019s when they told us, `If they hit you, you don\u2019t have to worry. Two minutes you\u2019ll be dead.\u2019 So I start making my rounds. I went upstairs. I thought it\u2019d be better to tell our men, `Take off our boots, put on our shoes\u2019 \u2014 boots are too heavy, shoes are easy to move \u2014 remove. I walked that ship continuously talking to the men. So it was about 1:00 in the morning, I guess, and there was one \u2014 one escort ship was a Coast Guard cutter ahead of us, and two on each side, and the two freighters, then we were in the middle. And it\u2019d only do about nine, 12 knots top speed. And the Dorchester was loosing speed, you know, with the heavy seas. And we dropped back out of the convoy and there we were set right in the open and when we were there \u2014 when we were in the open, that\u2019s when they hit us. And I was sitting in a \u2014 in a \u2014 in a stateroom right off the \u2014 the starboard side I was on. And then we\u2019re sitting there playing cards and \u2014 and I went to snap the cards down and instead of saying `Gotcha,\u2019 I raised the card like that, everything went black. I said, `What the hell was that?\u2019 I said, `We\u2019re hit.\u2019 The Dorchester was 90 miles off the coast of Greenland where the water temperature of the Atlantic in winter is roughly 36 degrees. A storm the night before had frozen many of the lifeboats to the railing. Life jackets, each with a small red locator light offered the best, though still slim, chance for survival. I just come off guard duty. I took my jacket off, and the next thing you know, boom. And before you know it, the ship was rocking, and who had time to even think about a life jacket at that time? Again, David Fox, nephew of Chaplain George Fox. The chaplains organized the men. They would hand out these life jackets, put them on, and then they would lead them to a place where they could jump off and not be hurt. The chaplains, without any hesitation, just simply took off their own jackets and placed them on the next man who was waiting there. Lights went out and steam pipes broke and the screaming and the very, very strong odor of burnt powder \u2014 gun powder. I had to talk to myself. I had to fight off the panic which I heard was going on. I called out on deck and I looked around, there wasn\u2019t a soul on the ship. Not a soul. It\u2019s always best to get as many people to abandon a ship with you, hold on or tie on with anything so there\u2019ll be a group of lights. The Coast Guard sees a group of lights, that\u2019s where they\u2019re going first. But this way looked like a city out there, with the lights. Looked like a large city. And the ship now \u2014 by now is floundering and I looked down toward the stern, toward the back of the ship, I see a bunch of heads moving. I was so happy that I got somebody to go abandon ship with. I must have lit up like a hundred-watt lightbulb. I went down there. Good Lord, there\u2019s 10 men, not a word is said, not a word. All the men and the chaplains opened up with prayer and I see that they were not going overboard. They were not going to abandon ship. They were going to hold our last service. I began to say my prayers \u2014 say my prayers, you know, and shed tears. I couldn\u2019t abandon ship there. I went back to the port side, two feet to jump. As I jumped, the ship broke. A huge wave pulled me away from the ship. Another wave hit me, and I got a mouthful of oil. It was choking me and I \u2014 and I heard a voice. `Pull him up.\u2019 There was a lifeboat there. `Pull him in.\u2019 There was \u2014 oh, we must have had about 20 guys in the raft. I remember they piled one on top of the other, you know. And by the time they picked us up I think we had six or seven left. You know, they got cold and froze, they just slid off. There\u2019s one guy hanging on the back of the raft. I held him up for \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long it was. Time don\u2019t mean nothing, you know. And finally, he was dead. I \u2014 I had to let him go. We seen bodies all around drifting, and as I say, the chill of the water got most of them and they were just drifting around. You seen those little lights a-bobbing up and down, and there was no life in the men that was in them, either. We could look back and some flames and a fire had broken out, and there was enough reflection of that in the water to be able to see the ship. There were soldiers hanging on to the rail of the ship. We had little red lights on our life preservers. As I turned around, I saw a sight that will forever be with me. It was the Dorchester making its last lurch into the water. And it looked like a Christmas tree. When she rolled, she rolled to starboard, and all I could see was the keel up there, and there we saw the four chaplains standing arm-in-arm on the top of the boat, and then the \u2014 the boat took a nosedive and went right down and they went with it. They never even made a move. They just joined hands and the four of them \u2014 was two Protestant and a Hebrew chaplain and a Catholic chaplain. I asked Father Washington, `Father, get off the ship. The ship\u2019s going down.\u2019 `No, no,\u2019 he says, `Go ahead. You get off. Get off,\u2019 Because the ship was starting to list, but they made no attempt to get off at all. They just went down. Those who saw that \u2014 and not everyone saw it, but those who saw it said they had never seen a finer \u2014 one man said, `I never hoped to see anything finer between here and heaven.\u2019 Dear Mr. Fox, I\u2019m writing a letter to you in remembrance to the event for nearly 55 years, which led us together, and also the last living sailors of the German submarine U-223. During the war, everybody served and even died for his country \u2014 your soldiers on the Dorchester who could not be rescued as well as our sailors who were defeated and drowned by the depth charges of your destroyers. The four chaplains are genuine heroes, and their sacrifices has to be preserved for future generations. We have to learn out of the past for the future so that our children and grandchildren and further generations to come can live in peace. Never again should happen such a murderous war. Yours sincerely, Kapuska. I had to go to Germany and interview the survivors of the U-boat to put the pieces together. Again, David Fox, who directs the Immortal Chaplains Foundation. There were about six of them still alive, though I was able to interview three of them, including the first officer of the submarine, who\u2019s the last surviving officer. And also the chief munitions (German spoken) \u2014 he handled the torpedoes, he actually had his hand on the torpedo that sank the Dorchester \u2014 and interviewed him. And that was so moving to go to Germany and say, `Hello. You\u2019ve never met me, but you killed my uncle 55 years ago,\u2019 or whatever it was. How did he\u2026 That story\u2026 How did he respond to meeting you? They were cautious at first, but when I said I\u2019m \u2014 you know, `I\u2019m coming not to blame you, but to me that \u2014 there are two sides of the story.\u2019 You know, I think that must have been astonishing for these German veterans because they did lose the war and they are held responsible \u2014 the German people in general are held responsible for such horrendous crimes. They\u2019re not often offered forgiveness. That\u2019s right, and I felt that just as the chaplains reached out to each other, I said I felt that as a representative of the families of the chaplains I wanted to reach out to them because I \u2014 I felt that the chaplains would have forgiven them, and therefore my going said that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith, with a program to commemorate Memorial Day. My guest David Fox has shared the informal interviews he conducted with the surviving veterans of the troop ship Dorchester on which nearly 700 American soldiers died off the coast of Greenland in 1943. David Fox has also made contact with the veterans of the German submarine that torpedoed them, and they, like the American soldiers who witnessed the event, have been profoundly affected by the legacy of four chaplains of different faiths who linked arms and went down together with their ship. In 1997 David Fox created the Immortal Chaplains Foundation in Minnesota. The foundation awards an international prize for humanity to recognize acts of faith and reconciliation which counterbalance more familiar images in our world of violence. The first prize was given posthumously to a man on board one of those Coast Guard cutters, the Comanche, and his name was Charles W. David, and he was a black man and he was a big man. He was from New York City. And when that ship, the Dorchester, went down, he went over the side of the Comanche and pulled up white men in 36 degrees temperature water, sometimes, they said, two at a time. And Charles W. David died of exposure, of pneumonia, because he did that. After saving all those lives. After saving those lives. Dick Swanson, who was his comrade on board, came and accepted the award in his place. He was his shipmate. Dick was white, Charles was black. And\u2026 And, again, we\u2019re talking 1943. 1943. Yeah. And when that ship went into the port in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, they couldn\u2019t go to the same place together. They couldn\u2019t go into the same club, they couldn\u2019t go in \u2014 do things together. They were segregated. And yet he did that with his life. So that was the first prize. And then the second one was to a young girl, you know, an American girl from California, Amy Biehl, who went to South Africa and was stoned to death. She went there to fight apartheid, and ironically was bringing a black friend back to their home in the Soweto neighborhoods, and she was stoned to death by a group of black people. And her mother and father came from California to accept that award, and it was Archbishop Desmond Tutu who presented the award. And that meant a great deal to him. I remember that story clearly. Yeah. It was so stunning that they also went and testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, right? And\u2026 Exactly. And asked that the \u2014 the killers of Amy be forgiven. Mm. You \u2014 you also, I believe, arranged for some of the German sub veterans to meet \u2014 did they meet the veterans\u2026 Quite. \u2026of the Dorchester? Yes. When Rosalie, the rabbi\u2019s daughter, and I \u2014 we started to share how important it would be to keep the story alive, but also to tell the story of others who have done this. So I contacted Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa and I asked him if he would be a part of this. And it was such a great thing for him to come here and participate in our first event in Minneapolis. Some of us might preach eloquent sermons about laying down one\u2019s life. They lived out their sermons. Isn\u2019t that a wonderful sentence, that? They lived out their sermons by dying. Jesus said, `Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains barren. It remains alone. If it dies, it brings forth abundantly.\u2019 Have we not here in the saga of these four wonderful men an extraordinary illustration of both of these sayings? They should have disappeared from the face of the Earth as they did physically, as they went down into the icy cold waters of the Atlantic. But isn\u2019t it extraordinary that now the opposite has happened, that instead of oblivion and forgetfulness, they receive glory and honor. For greater love than this has no one, that a person should lay down their life for their friends. Archbishop Desmond Tutu preaching at the first awards ceremony of the Immortal Chaplains prize for humanity in Minneapolis in 1998. The following year, the prize recipients included Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered 1,000 people of the Tutsi tribe while 800,000 others were slaughtered by his own Hutu tribesmen. David Fox counts as one of his great memories an unsolicited visit he received after that award from a later prime minister of Rwanda. It turned out that he was one of the people Paul Rusesabagina kept alive in his hotel. This is something that is beyond my anticipation\u2026 Yes. \u2026my expectations. I had no idea that we would touch people in this way. Well, you know, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s something in this story about \u2014 about ripple effects\u2026 Exactly. \u2026and about the larger unseen possibilities in a moment, and it doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t take the tragedy away, but there was so much reconciliation and \u2014 and compassion and goodness that was possible to come out of that over time. And it\u2019s true of every other story you\u2019ve told me, all of your other recipients of the award. Right. Right. And I have to mention one other thing, too. I was scheduled to go and talk to a school \u2014 a hi \u2014 a hi \u2014 a high school on a \u2014 a day in April that was the day after the Columbine, Colorado, massacre. I got a letter from the \u2014 from the principal the next week, and he said, `After you spoke to the students on that day,\u2019 he said, `the following assembly, students started to get up and publicly apologize to people that they had pushed out and made to feel less than themselves.\u2019 And he said it was that \u2014 the combination of that story of the \u2014 what the chaplains did and the catharsis of \u2014 of Columbine, the recognition of not having compassion, excluding people, pushing people apart. He said, `That story that you told has an amazing power to it.\u2019 So that\u2019s why we feel it\u2019s important to keep this alive. I think that that simple act \u2014 simple but it was great \u2014 has changed my life. I \u2014 I try to do more for people. I don\u2019t worry about me so much. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m doing something for somebody else. A veteran of the troop ship Dorchester from the audio archives of David Fox. This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break we\u2019ll return with Vietnam veteran and poet Bruce Weigl. His writing enlarges comprehension of the Vietnam War and the possibilities of the human spirit. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, a special program on sacrifice and reconciliation to commemorate Memorial Day. My next guest, Bruce Weigl, went to Vietnam as a soldier in 1968, one of the two and a half million Americans who served there from the early 1960s until the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973. Over 58,000 American soldiers were killed in Vietnam, and over 300,000 wounded. Today, Bruce Weigl is a poet. His book The Circle of Hahn chronicles the long personal journey he\u2019s made back to Vietnam and to the adoption of a beloved Vietnamese child. The paradox of his life as a writer, he says, is that the war ruined his life and gave him his voice. First, it was adventurous, but then quickly that turned into something very different after I saw the first injured people that I \u2014 that I was forced to confront. I think the first person I saw seriously injured was a Vietnamese farmer who had stepped on an American landmine, and he happened to be in a field hospital at Camp Evans, where I was stationed for my base camp. And half of his body was gone, yet he was still alive and screaming. I\u2019ll never forget his face and I\u2019ll never forget those screams. And then suddenly one minute I was one person, and after experiencing just that first incident, I was another person. And I suddenly began to realize that I had no idea what I was in for and \u2014 and where I was and what I was doing. There is also this remarkable source of a gift really and a salvation in your story in that you have this occasion to begin to read. Yes. I guess it turns out to be my good fortune to have gotten a really bad case of dysentery and got sent back to a larger base camp at a place called Ankai. And I was laying in a \u2014 on a cot recovering, and a Red Cross volunteer came through the tent where I was with other sick soldiers and he had a box of paperback books. And he was just tossing them to people, saying, `Here, read this.\u2019 And he tossed one to me, and I really didn\u2019t have that much interest, although I started reading. I couldn\u2019t pronounce the names in the book, yet there was a quality to the voice that was telling the story that \u2014 that\u2026 And the book was? Crime and Punishment \u2014 Dostoevsky\u2019s great novel Crime and Punishment. I think not a bad first book for a writer to read. I wonder if that newfound dream was one thing that sustained you in that time even before you yourself did begin to write. I \u2014 yeah, I think it did, the sense that I had this desire to want to somehow record what I was seeing around me was something that sustained me. And just the love of \u2014 the love of words that I was already beginning to feel. It seems to me there are some \u2014 some words that you use a great deal and they become very evocative. And one of those words is `enormity.\u2019 What do you think of or what stories do you think of when you say that word? I think I think of divinity, however you want to call that \u2014 God, powers greater than myself, the enormity of the historical forces that were at work. You know, I could never at that time as an 18- or a 19-year-old have articulated any of this. But, you know, I was like a sponge. Ignorance served me well. I was too stupid to realize that I couldn\u2019t do what I had in mind that I wanted to do. But I must have had some kind of vague sense that I was witness to the great machine of history right before me. When you were in Vietnam, did you have a sense of divinity, even an ironic one? Well, yeah, I was raised a Catholic and I \u2014 I always loved church as a kid. I always felt great peace and salvation and grace when I went to Mass, and great peace when I went to confession and Communion. And then when I was in the war, I actually witnessed a priest in preparation for our assault at Khe Sanh in 1968, which was one of the largest \u2014 supposed to be one of the largest battles of the war, blessing a cache of \u2014 of armaments. And I immediately said, `This is wrong. This is not \u2014 you know, the God that I grew up loving, the Jesus that I grew up loving wouldn\u2019t do this, wouldn\u2019t bless these things that are going to be sent out to murder human beings any minute.\u2019 So I let go of my ties to the church, and \u2014 although I never let go of my belief in that which we call divinity, you know, the officialdom of the church in that context. It was heartbreaking almost for me. I think I got lost for a long time without the church because I don\u2019t think I realized how important it had been to me until I was without it. Many of the qualities that seem to be part of the relationship that you eventually had with Vietnam seem to me to be sacred religious qualities of compassion\u2026 Yeah. \u2026reconciliation. Yeah. I\u2019d like to know \u2014 I\u2019d like to hear about how you ended up \u2014 having had this experience, which was devastating in many ways \u2014 how you\u2019ve come to see Vietnam now as the home of your heart and \u2014 and you have so many connections with the place. Yeah. Yeah, great. I\u2019m going to have to go back just a little bit further\u2026 OK. \u2026because I have to say that when I was there, I really loved the Vietnamese people that I had contact with. And I thought, in spite of all the bad stuff that was happening around me that it was an absolutely breathtakingly beautiful place. I liked the food, I liked the people, I liked the landscape. These are things that one would not admit to one\u2019s comrades in that context. It would have been absurd. They would have thought I was crazy or that something was wrong with me if I would have shared any of this. And I always had a sense that I wanted to go back. And then lo and behold 20-odd years later, I was invited by the offices of a retired North Vietnamese general in Hanoi in the early \u201980s. Not many Americans had gone back to Vietnam. I think we were the \u2014 maybe the second group. I agreed to go on this trip thinking that it would never happen. You know, there was still an embargo and \u2014 and travel was literally impossible. And suddenly the trip came through and I found myself in Bangkok picking up a visa and an hour and a half later landing in Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, Vietnam. We were received, I have to say, with such absolutely kindness and generosity of spirit that I was suspicious. I just couldn\u2019t believe after what we had done to those people in that country that we would be received this way. And I thought, `Something is up here. What do they want?\u2019 Fortunately that first trip I got very close to that general and to a few other friends \u2014 Vietnamese friends that I made and I got to see that, in fact, there was nothing dubious about their attitude. Their attitude was that we had been in a war together, we had been soldiers on the opposite side. Now that was over. And I began to learn over the years upon my many trips back that, in fact, the Vietnamese love a great deal about our country. Ho Chi Minh had a copy of our Constitution on his table when the war was on. Really? Yeah. They love our \u2014 our independence of spirit. They love our sense of humor, our openness. They\u2019re very much like us in many ways. And \u2014 and\u2026 Didn\u2019t you also go at some point with other veterans who had become writers? Yeah. In 1990, we had a remarkable conference with half a dozen or so American writers who had been soldiers in the war, including a few journalists. And we met with 50 Vietnamese writers who had also fought in the war on the side of the \u2014 on the side of the North Vietnamese Army. And some were popular resistance soldiers. You know, we would start comparing notes about where we were and when we were there. And it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t unusual for some of us to find men on the other side that we had literally fought against, that, you know, we could have killed each other on that day and it didn\u2019t happen. And, you know, just the thought of that was enough to make me pause. In those meetings then, I mean, were you able to forgive each other and \u2014 and also to forgive yourselves? Yeah. I \u2014 I think that \u2014 that, you know, their forgiveness was so \u2014 was so overwhelming that it was almost enough for everyone to go around. But in terms of forgiving myself, I think that it has a lot to do with \u2014 with the kind of command that you were associated with. I was with the 1st Air Cav., which had an absolutely great command. And there was no nonsense in my outfit. There was no \u2014 no abuse of civilians. As a matter of fact, we had very, very little contact with people when we were out in the field. So I think that I can say I don\u2019t feel like I did anything that I\u2019m ashamed of as a soldier. It was more \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that kind of forgiveness. It was more, I think, a forgiveness of just having bore witness to that, that there\u2019s a way in which once you cross certain lines about killing and seeing killing and being so close to it that it\u2019s hard then to be among the company of people who haven\u2019t been in that situation. And I think that\u2019s where the forgiveness part came in, that \u2014 that \u2014 you know, that I felt for a long time unworthy of \u2014 of the love of those around me just because of what I had seen. Poet and Vietnam veteran Bruce Weigl. This is a poem of my own called \u201CSong of Napalm,\u201D which is dedicated to my wife. (Reading) \u201CAfter the storm, after the rain stopped pounding, we stood in the doorway watching horses walk off lazily across the pasture\u2019s hill. We stared through the black screen, our vision altered by the distance, so I thought I saw a mist kicked up around their hooves when they faded like cutout horses away from us. The grass was never more blue and that light more scarlet. Beyond the pasture, trees scraped their voices into the wind, branches crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire. But you said, `They were only branches. OK.\u2019 The storm stopped pounding. I\u2019m trying to say this straight. For once I was sane enough to pause and breathe outside my wild plans, and after the hard rain I turned my back on the old curses. I believed they swung finally away from me. But still the branches are wire and thunder is the pounding mortar. Still I close my eyes and see the girl running from her village, napalm stuck to her dress like jelly, her hands reaching for the no one who waits in waves of heat before her. So I can keep on living, so I can stay here beside you, I try to imagine she runs down the road and wings beat inside her until she rises above the stinking jungle and her pain eases, and your pain and mine. But the lie swings back again. The lie works only as long as it takes to speak, and the girl runs only as far as the napalm allows until her burning tendons and crackling muscles draw her up into that final position burning bodies so perfectly assume. Nothing can change that. She is burned behind my eyes, and not your good love, and not the rain-swept air, and not the jungle green pasture unfolding before us can deny it. \u201C The title poem in Bruce Weigl\u2019s 1988 collection Song of Napalm. Six years later, in 1994, Bruce Weigl edited another poetry collection which he himself translated. This collection is called Captured Documents, and it contains informal poems found in the diaries of captured or fallen North Vietnamese soldiers. They are predominantly love poems or verses of longing for family and home. I asked Bruce Weigl to read me his personal favorite, \u201COne Moonlit Night.\u201D (Reading) Tonight the wind is cold on bamboo trees, the moon hides behind the mountain\u2019s top. In sadness the river ripples. I received your letter and read it nervously through the night, and afterward I knew you grieved for me like a mother and wept. Nephews and nieces wait far away; sorrowfully, aunts and uncles wait, too. You begged me to come home, my love, to the family of our village because my life is still full of sweet promise. You do not understand the way of the truth. Life must be spent for the people\u2019s good. I picked a violet to tuck into my book. Tears mixed with the violet\u2019s ink to weave into my writing. All the wishes I send so you will understand. A reading from \u201CCaptured Documents,\u201D Bruce Weigl\u2019s translation of poems found in the diaries of North Vietnamese soldiers. Weigl first became a reader and a writer while a soldier in Vietnam. He says that experience both ruined his life and gave him is voice. He\u2019s talking to me about the many ways in which he\u2019s made peace with Vietnam, a country which today he calls \u201Cthe home of his heart.\u201D As a teacher of college students, he also works to reconcile the mixture of honor and horror that characterizes the human experience of war. You know, I\u2019ve began to talk to my students years ago about the fact that years ago, you know, all cultures like to look at these things as \u2014 as anomalies. And, you know, my question to them was: When are we going to stop saying it\u2019s unusual? We\u2019ve always done it to each other. It\u2019s always been present from\u2026 Well not only \u2014 yeah. And there \u2014 but there\u2019s also a \u2014 a way in which we are fascinated by it. And there are ways that \u2014 that people speak about it.There seems to be a beauty or an ob \u2014 obsession that can come with the experience of war. Absolutely. You know, Robert Stone talks about the beauty of the mushroom cloud, you know, which is an absolutely horrifying image if you think about all of its implications. But, you know, th \u2014 I think that it has to do with the absolute bare essential that you\u2019re stripped down to in that kind of context. I \u2014 I have a poem in which I say, `Say it clearly and you make it beautiful no matter what.\u2019 There\u2019s a way in which language can make the most horrible thing imaginable beautiful, not because it celebrates that horror but because through the language I think the human spirit transcends that horror; that I think to write the poem, to write the story, to write the novel, the memoir or whatever about that horrible thing is in a way to defeat it, you know, or to take back your life from it. R \u2014 right. Is it true that you have become Buddhist? Yes, I have. I had met some monks in Vietnam at\u2026 While you were there as a soldier? Once when I was there as a soldier, yeah. I had a remarkable experience with some monks. And then\u2026 Well, tell me about that. That\u2019s too intriguing. I guess the terrible and embarrassing irony is I was with a couple of other GIs and we were actually looking for women of ill repute. We can say that on the radio. Yes, we can. Prostitutes. And I was led through this maze of rooms and alleyways, and somehow I got separated from my friends. And I \u2014 I ended up in this room and there were two or three monks sitting on the floor chanting. And I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just sat down kind of with them. And they looked at me as if I belonged there somehow, you know. There was this, you know, 18-year-old GI stumbling around, and I always felt as if they had instilled something in me. Really? Yeah. And I left that room thinking that somehow that this was going to mean something to my life. And then when I went back in \u201986 and \u201989 and \u201990 I met some other monks who I got to spend more time with. They were the friends of writer friends of mine. And I began to then come back and study Buddhism more and more and to practice meditation. And it really began to change my life in dramatic ways. Western medical science says, `Well, you\u2019ve got to put that behind you,\u2019 whereas Buddhism says, `It\u2019s part of who you are now, make a life from that.\u2019 I\u2019ve always felt the sense of being called to something, even as a child, and this sense that there were passageways to other ways of living, other ways of looking at the world. There were portals that led to other ways of understanding. You know, that was a door that opened, that door called Vietnam. And once I became a writer and \u2014 and I could re-open that door, which was an easy thing to do, I had 20 years of nightmares \u2014 then there\u2019s a way in which there was no turning back, no going back from what I knew was behind that door. You mean in terms of the possibilities of \u2014 of living with that and \u2014 and making sense of it? That\u2019s right. Uh-huh. Yeah, just the possibility of living with it. Or just living. Mm. So you, at some point, walked through this portal back to that place\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and to the fullness of that place. And you have ended up adopting a Vietnamese girl\u2026 Yes. \u2026when she was eight years old. Yes. When did that idea take shape in your mind and \u2014 and how did that happen? We began talking about another child, and then discovered that we couldn\u2019t have another child. And I had been going to Vietnam regularly by this point, and I had visited some orphanages. So I \u2014 I broached this idea with my wife and she was up for trying it. It was a long, arduous, complicated process. So \u2014 and against the advice of the adoption agency, I contacted some of my friends in Vietnam, and a month later we basically got a call from the adoption agency saying, `You have to go now. They have someone for you.\u2019 I rushed home from my teaching job and there was a social worker there who had a dossier about this little girl whose name was Nguyen Thi Hahn, who was eight years old. And she had a picture, and she said she was going to leave the dossier for us to think about. And I said that wouldn\u2019t be necessary, that we wanted her. Just from the picture? From the picture and from \u2014 I think from something inside of us as well, something inside of me that just felt right, the little bit that I read about her. And once I saw that face, there was no saying no. Bruce Weigl\u2019s daughter Hahn reading a love poem in her native Vietnamese. Bruce Weigl\u2019s latest book is a memoir of his journey to the adoption of Hahn. This is how his book The Circle of Hahn ends. (Reading) We were all swept up then into a long frantic afternoon of meetings and ceremonies at several different provincial and district offices. More than once along the way a small snag would develop because our timing was off according to one official or another. The snag would always be followed by much animated talk and by the sound of voices rising almost too high in their insistence. I didn\u2019t worry over it. I was on auto pilot. I was most alive but I don\u2019t remember many of the details. I signed a hundred documents, shook hands and thanked the cool officials. And near what I knew was the end of the official drama, I gave my speech in Vietnam. We finally all piled out of the last jury office and drove a short distance into the village to a small open-air restaurant where four long tables had been pushed together and were already being covered with dishes of food and bottles of beer that two or three young women were carrying out from the kitchen. I wanted to sit next to Hahn, to use the occasion of the lunch to speak with her, but I could tell that she was still very shy of me. I knew that Hahn was not accustomed to eating this way. The meal, paid for by Holt, was very special. Hahn stared wide-eyed at the dishes of every food that she had probably ever eaten or seen and some she had probably never seen piling up on the table. And after some initial hesitation and at the urging of Vun, who knew the value of eating as much as you could when the opportunity presented itself, Hahn began to eat. I had never seen a child eat that way before. I smiled to myself as I watched her. I could not imagine where in that small body all of that food was going or how it could be contained there. She ate until the last plate of scraps was taken from the table. I watched her lean back into her chair, bend and stretch her back and then belch so loudly she made herself laugh. Vun scolded her but could not resist laughing as well. The rest happened too quickly I think for everyone. We drove the few kilometers back to the orphanage where I collected a small bundle of Hahn\u2019s clothes and the album of photographs of her friends and her teachers at the orphanage. I said goodbye to Vun and promised I would try to care for Hahn as well as she had and that Hahn would be my daughter as if she had been born into our family. I turned to watch as alone or in pairs all of the children made their way to where Hahn stood next to Vun and said their sweet and quiet goodbyes. I looked hard at Hahn\u2019s face and I could see some panic in her eyes as our driver started the engine and turned the air conditioner on for our drive back to Hanoi. An impromptu group photograph of the children and staff of the orphanage standing around me in the courtyard was set up but interrupted by a sudden heavy rain. Vun put her arm around Hahn and then I saw that for the first time they were both crying. I wanted to tell Hahn that I loved her, because I did. I wanted to tell her that I wished she would come and be part of our family more than anything else in the world, but that if she wanted to stay in Bingluk and not come home with me, I would understand and I would love her just as much. I almost made those words come out of my mouth but I had the sense for once to stay quiet. Vun let go of Hahn then, and then, looking up into the sky, she pushed her gently toward the van. As we pulled away through the courtyard and the arched gate, I watched Hahn look back more than once. Many children were waving in the rain, their small hands open, their small hands through the distance like lotus blossoms opening on the fish pond. From Bruce Weigl\u2019s memoir, The Circle of Hahn.
