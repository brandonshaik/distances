  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, a public conversation with Robert Wright. His book The Evolution of God charts an intellectual path beyond the faith-versus-reason debate. Wright takes a relentlessly logical look at the history of religion, exposing its contradictions. Yet he also traces something revelatory moving through human history. The basic direction in which social organization moved, that is, from hunter-gatherer village to chiefdom, ancient state, empire, and now we\u2019re on the verge of a globalized society, I\u2019m arguing that the affect that that\u2019s had on our conception of God\u2019s compassion has tended to be a good one. That as the world grows, a social organization gets more complex, people get more inter-dependant, you see an adaptation on the part of God, and it does become a God of broader compassion. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Robert Wright\u2019s book The Evolution of God has been much talked about in both religious and secular circles. In my mind, this is a bridge book \u2014 it has opened new conversation points beyond the religion-versus-science, faith-versus-atheism debates that galvanized American publishing and politics in recent years. Wright\u2019s relentlessly logical approach to the history of the three monotheistic religions \u2014 Judaism, Christianity, and Islam \u2014 has something in common with the new atheist literature. He shines a light on radical inconsistencies in the Bible and the Qur\u2019an \u2014 shifts in authorship and messaging that have been well known to theologians across the generations but not often passed on to lay people. Yet while maintaining his agnosticism, Robert Wright ultimately concludes that these religions do reveal a larger purpose \u2014 something one might call revelatory \u2014 unfolding through human history. I want to note, as we start, something that I did not know about you, is that you were born in Oklahoma. True. And they were raised Southern Baptist. I was. Did you know that both of those things are true of me as well? Really? Yeah. That\u2019s eerie. I know. So there is a God, then. Well, it\u2019s proof of something. I\u2019m not sure what. OK. This couldn\u2019t be chance. After that self-indulgent beginning, some important words as you analyze the human condition of the religious enterprise are purpose and meaning and truth. And I\u2019d like to ask you about the sense of those things, of purpose, meaning, and truth, that you had in that Southern Baptist upbringing in Oklahoma and then I think Texas later on. Yeah. Well, yeah, there was no doubt about the source of purpose, meaning, and truth when I was Southern Baptist as a child. I had a very kind of pervasive sense of God\u2019s presence, I guess. And, in fact, at age eight or nine I chose to walk up to the front of the church and accept Jesus as my savior. My parents weren\u2019t there and there was no pressure from them at all. They were devout, but I later found out that they actually worried that I wasn\u2019t ready to make a decision like that. So I was, you know, quite religious. And then you\u2019ve written somewhere that at some point you were bowled over when you learned about the power and beauty of the theory of evolution. Tell me about that. Well, I mean, for starters, I should say that because my parents were creationists certainly at that point, there did seem to me to be a conflict between Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and religion as I understood it. And I remember asking my mother about, \u201CWhat about these dinosaur bones and stuff?\u201D when I was 12 or 13. But it was when I was a sophomore in high school that I really understood the theory of natural selection. And it is just a beautiful, in the sense of powerful, elegant theory. Very, very, very simple principles can in principle explain tremendous complexity. That\u2019s what, you know, intellectual elegance is. So it was in direct conflict with your parents\u2019 understanding of this, but did you immediately see it as an absolute contradiction? I must have, because I know in high school I was like the village atheist. OK. In San Antonio, Texas. There weren\u2019t that many avowed atheists. Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t call myself an atheist now, but in high school, that was my little niche. So one of the things that you say in The Evolution of God, this becomes very nuanced in the course of the book, but you say that gods arose as illusions and that the history you\u2019re tracing is, certainly in one sense, of the evolution of an illusion. And, you know, when did you first think that? Wow. Let\u2019s see. Well, the title of the book was in place 10 years or so ago when I started kind of thinking about it and working on it. So I guess at that point the idea was there. The question is could it nonetheless be, even if back when there were only hunter-gatherer villages, these were kind of flat-out illusions and fictions and just kind of extensions of human cognition in a context of trying to make sense of the world. Can\u2019t it be that they started out like that, but as kind of the history of religion advances, or at least moves forward, and people refined their conception of God, that eventually you could get closer to something that is actually the truth about God or about the divine or about something? And that\u2019s one thing I\u2019m trying to look at in the book. OK. So what I\u2019d like to do is talk about some of the overriding themes, some of the overriding story you tell, and some of the most striking observations you make, and original observations, and then talk about what it all means. OK. Well, the first complication is that the books as they appear in the Bible are not appearing in the order in which they were written. So the second chapter of Genesis to which you referred was apparently written before the first. Right. And it\u2019s not the same God. Right. And so you have a more manifestly anthropomorphic God in the second chapter and you do see, you know, over the longest haul, see a couple of things. The conception of God gets less anthropomorphic, not in any straightforward linear way, but people think less of a God as a guy sitting on a throne, although that really seems to have been very much the original conception. And then the other thing that\u2019s changing and in a way the thing I was most interested in, was kind of the moral tenor of God. How broad is God\u2019s compassion? Does God\u2019s compassion extend beyond the Israelites? Right. And I tried to show that God\u2019s compassion is a function, to a large extent, of kind of what\u2019s happening on the ground in terms of political and economic things. And I make the further argument that that\u2019s kind of good news in the following sense \u2014 that the basic direction in which social organization moved, that is, from hunter-gatherer village to chiefdom, ancient state, empire, and now we\u2019re on the verge of a globalized society, I\u2019m arguing that the affect that that\u2019s had on our conception of God\u2019s compassion has tended to be a good one. That as the world grows, as social organization gets more complex, people get more interdependent, you see an adaptation on the part of God and it does become a God of broader compassion. Again, not in a straightforward linear way, in fits and starts. But I think you see it, and I try to tell that story in the context of initially the Hebrew Bible. In the course of the Hebrew Bible and between what Christians know as the Old Testament and the New, as Robert Wright sees it, God broadly becomes less mercurial and wrathful, more loving and more universally compassionate. Christianity spread correspondingly beyond its origins in Judaism and across lines of tribe, class, and national borders. I\u2019m a Philo fan. You\u2019re a Philo fan. And again, you know, Philo is someone who scholars of the Old Testament of the Hebrew Bible write about, but you really emphasize him. You write, \u201CPhilo\u2019s tolerance was non-zero-sum logic incarnate.\u201D So tell us what that means. Right. What you mean by that. So I should say a couple of things. Who was Philo? He was a Jew living in the Roman Empire and very much influenced by Greek culture at the time of Jesus. A word that was at the center of his philosophy that I look at pretty closely was the Logos. Now, when you read the Bible and the Book of John when it says, \u201CIn the beginning was the word.\u201D In the New Testament. In the New Testament, yes. And the word that\u2019s translated as \u201Cword\u201D is the Greek word \u201Clogos.\u201D And almost certainly that word was intended to have much the philosophical resonance that it had for Philo. But there was behind that also a faith that there are orderly laws that \u2014 natural laws that govern them all. Yeah. Well, Philo was trying to reconcile the Greek philosophy that he was encountering, which had a kind of a scientific aura, with his Jewish heritage. Trying to reconcile the Torah with a kind of scientific outlook. And I think that\u2019s why he talks about a God that\u2019s not anthropomorphic and talks about a God that imparts this order to the universe. So the laws of nature are manifestations of Divine Will. And a really interesting thing about Philo \u2014 we\u2019re getting around to the non-zero-sumness part \u2014 Philo saw the world as moving towards greater and greater interdependence and ultimately, as history is culminating, in a giant global society and, in fact, a democracy. And he saw that driven by the interdependence of people, but that society would congeal on a global level he saw as being driven by the kind of need that people have for one another as a practical matter. They have to get along. And this brings us to the term \u201Cnon-zero-sum.\u201D So the win-lose scenarios make less sense for anyone. Right? Well, I\u2019m sure all of us can think of people with whom we have kind of win-lose situations. We can think of rivals and competitors and so on. But I do think that over time, more and more people come into non-zero-sum relationships, potentially win-win relationships, with more people further and further around the world. Mm-hmm. And because I think that actually drives a kind of moral progress, that is, it\u2019s a tolerance of other people. And I think Philo is a good example of that as well, some of his writing is. I think that\u2019s among the evidence that maybe there is some larger purpose unfolding. And that\u2019s quite consistent with his philosophy. Let\u2019s talk about the New Testament briefly and a little bit more. You portray the apostle Paul as a great marketing guru, but I think the analogy that struck me more was you called him \u201Cthe Bill Gates of his time.\u201D You know, what do you mean by that and what does that have to do with the evolution of God as seen in the New Testament? Well, it\u2019s very closely related to what I just said about how expanding social structure can lead to moral progress. OK. It has to do with Paul\u2019s \u2014 you could call it his entrepreneurship. Although I do think he was sincerely motivated. I don\u2019t think he was cynical. I think he was a believer, but I do think he had the ambition of starting an empire-wide church. And because the Roman Empire was multinational, that dictated that he emphasize a love that crosses national bounds. And I think that\u2019s where, you know, there\u2019s his famous line, \u201CThere\u2019s neither Jew nor Greek, all are one in Christ.\u201D \u201CNeither slave nor free.\u201D \u201CNeither male nor female, neither slave nor free.\u201D What I\u2019m arguing is that there you\u2019re seeing an example of when social structure expands to this multinational level within the Roman Empire, that fact generates doctrines of tolerance and even universal love. I don\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s inevitable that those doctrines win out and right now we\u2019re at a time in history where that\u2019s the question. We are in a situation of global interdependence where certainly the rational thing for humanity to do is get along, which would be abetted by doctrines of tolerance and even love. And there are people who are on the job, but obviously there are forces working in the other direction and so the outcome is not clear. But what\u2019s interesting to me is that the world seems to be set up in such a way that either humans make moral progress in the sense of expanding their conception of compassion and love more broadly or they pay the price of social chaos and collapse. I really think the world is set up that way, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s not crazy to speculate that there\u2019s a purpose that merits the term \u201Cdivine.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media today in a public conversation with Robert Wright about the evolution of God. In his book of that title, he argues that one effect of successful religions across human history has been to keep chaos at bay, encouraging salvation at a social, not merely a personal, level. He notes the irony that at the present moment, the global social order seems threatened precisely by religious tensions and religious people. But, Robert Wright concludes, \u201CTheir scriptures are, beneath the surface, maps of the landscape of religious tolerance and intolerance, maps that amount to a kind of code for the salvation of the world.\u201D You bring your game theory back into this. In the sweep of these texts there are violent impulses and there is the love impulse. Right? Yeah. There\u2019s kill your enemies and there is love the stranger, love your enemy. Mm-hmm. One thing you say that I think speaks to a lot of discussion and hand-wringing and genuine anxiety that a lot of people have had about religion in the world in the last decade especially, you talk about when people see themselves in a zero-sum relationship with others, they tend to resonate with the intolerance side of scriptures. That\u2019s also, I think, when they\u2019re fearful, not just angry. When they tend to have more non-zero-sum, win-win attitude towards life and also the confidence and security to have that, they tend to resonate with the tolerance strains in scriptures. Right. I mean, you know, this is a \u2014 although I had the book in mind before 9/11. Certainly 9/11 gave it kind of more relevance and one big question was what brings out the worst in religion, what brings out the best? Right. And some people after 9/11 went out and got copies of the Qur\u2019an to try to understand what had happened, and that\u2019s not irrelevant to what happened, but I do try to emphasize that people have a scripture but they can pick and choose from the scripture what they want to emphasize and what\u2019s interesting to me is what makes them choose that. When I talked about ancient times and the question of what kind of mood is God in at a given point, why these mood fluctuations between belligerence \u2014 in both the Bible and Qur\u2019an. You have God at one point \u2026 Yeah, all of these inconsistencies, everything I just said, is true of the Qur\u2019an as well. Yeah. And what is it that accounts for it? You know, the argument is you put it in game theoretical terms but in other terms you could just say that people see other people as threatening, they\u2019re more likely to see their God as counseling belligerence toward those people. When they see them as people they can in some sense do business with, people they can constructively interact with, they\u2019re more likely to see their God as counseling tolerance. I\u2019m arguing that explains both the tolerant and belligerent scriptures in the first place, and it explain what circumstances will make people interpret their scripture in either a constructive or destructive way in the modern world. And I think, you know, when you see President Obama at the beginning of his administration trying to emphasize that the respect that he and Americans have for Muslims, that\u2019s an acknowledgement of that dynamic. That if people feel you don\u2019t respect them, then they are more likely to perceive you as a threat and they are more likely to go look for the parts of their scripture that would seem to justify violence. So having let you establish that, I also want to talk about the conclusion you reach about Islam in The Evolution of God, which does stand in a pretty striking contrast to a lot of the headline-driven wisdom about Islam that\u2019s waxed and waned since 9/11. Here\u2019s what you wrote about the sweep of that tradition, that scripture. \u201CIn terms of forces conducive to amity and tolerance in human history, in no other Abrahamic scripture are they as evident as in the Qur\u2019an. No other scripture so deeply cuts across the full spectrum of dynamics from intensely zero-sum to intensely non-zero-sum or so sharply expresses the intended moral tenor.\u201D Yeah. I mean, this is, in a way, a discovery that Islamic scholars made a long time ago. I mean, people are themselves believing Muslims and are scholars of the Qur\u2019an. They, long ago, set about dividing the different parts of the Qur\u2019an according to when apparently they were uttered by Muhammad. And you had these various phases of his career. The main distinction is between the verses in Mecca and the verses when he moved to Medina and his political situation changed. And they have noted the correlation between circumstance and the tenor of the verses. And it\u2019s very evident and it\u2019s just a textbook illustration of how circumstance drives your conception of God\u2019s will. There\u2019s the whole menu of verses there to choose from. We have an ongoing aspiration at Speaking of Faith to include as many of you as possible in public events like this conversation with Robert Wright, even if it happens on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in the dead of winter. At speakingoffaith.org, we did just that. We streamed video of this interview in real time and invited you to submit questions as if you were one of the hundreds sitting in the room. If you weren\u2019t one of the thousands who watched it live, you can still see the recorded video of this interview on our Web site. Or, if you prefer, download MP3s of this program and my unedited interview. And in March and April, we\u2019ll be streaming public conversations I\u2019ll be having at the New York Public Library and at gorgeous theaters in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Check out our SOF Live page and take part at speakingoffaith.org. After a short break, we\u2019ll wonder what cannot be understood by the kind of deconstructionist approach Robert Wright takes to religion and what image of God he ends up with. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, today in conversation with journalist and scholar Robert Wright about the evolution of God. His book of that title has opened new conversation points beyond the religion-versus-science, faith-versus-atheism debates that have galvanized American literary and political culture in recent years. \u201CMaybe in the end, a mercilessly scientific account of our predicament is actually compatible with a truly religious worldview and is part of the process that refines a religious worldview moving it closer to truth.\u201D I spoke with Robert Wright before a live audience. I know that you\u2019re not suggesting that this is the only way to analyze these texts and traditions but \u2026 Actually, it\u2019s the only way to ana \u2014 no. OK. I think it\u2019s pretty fascinating how constructive your materialist approach turns out to be and in some sense is validating, but I would like to talk a little bit about what gets lost when you do it that way. And one thing that I kept thinking about when I was reading The Evolution of God was a comparison that I really like that John Polkinghorne made. He\u2019s a quantum physicist who also became an Anglican theologian later in life, and he talked about how we need different ways of seeing the world to understand the complexity of the world. And he talked about how you could take a beautiful painting and a chemist could analyze the painting and could take off scraps of paint and tell you everything that was in them. And in the process, they would destroy the painting and would miss the point of the painting, though they would discover some useful things. Right. And I wonder if you thought about that as you were scraping off the \u2026 I mean, I was aware that that\u2019s the way it looks to a believer, what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s a totally materialist deconstruction of the history of religion. As I said, what distinguishes it from most of those kinds of enterprises by scholars is that I\u2019m arguing that after you do the deconstruction you see a pattern suggestive of some sort of larger purpose. Right. But I still recognized that the very mode of analysis is pretty left-brain and religious experience is thought of as kind of right-brain, I mean, to of course stereotype these experiences. You know, I just can\u2019t help it. I mean, I don\u2019t get into this in the book. I\u2019ve actually done a couple of one-week silent meditation retreats in a kind of secular Buddhist tradition. I\u2019ve read some of the things you\u2019ve written about that. And that takes me out of that mode and, in fact, has been an extremely profound experience for me and briefly transformative. It\u2019s hard to keep those transformations going. But I plead guilty. I\u2019m a left-brain thinker. Yeah. And I\u2019m not really trying to condemn you either way, but it\u2019s just that there is something else going on in these texts. There\u2019s truth of a different kind. There\u2019s wisdom about the \u2026 Oh, there\u2019s definitely wisdom. You know, there\u2019s wisdom about the human condition in addition to it being a reflection of wherever human beings were when they were writing it. Yeah. You know, a lot of it\u2019s poetry, not journalism. You look at me as if I wouldn\u2019t understand. No, no. I know you understand. I know you understand. But, so, OK. Here\u2019s what I wanted. I guess I do want to get at whether there might be some different ways to \u2014 or what have you thought about this. Yeah. So you say that cultural evolution pushed divinity and hence humanity toward moral enlightenment. Would another way to look at it be to say that human beings grew \u2014 let\u2019s assume that there is a God and a moral God, or some kind of moral truth that this is all pointing towards. That saves us time. Let\u2019s just assume this is the God. OK. Let\u2019s just assume it. That human beings, in fact, have grown in their ability to comprehend that divine morality. That that\u2019s another way of looking at the story that\u2019s being told. But, see, in a sense I kind of am saying that, without claiming to be sure whether there\u2019s a God or anything, but I am arguing that there seems to be a moral order out there in the sense that the world is set up in a way to drive people toward \u2014 I would say not just moral progress but something you could call moral truth. Right. So it is a story of humanity growing intellectually. Human nature, by inclining us to be capable of kind of expanding our moral imagination to people when it\u2019s in our interest, puts us on this intellectual path where as we think it through, we actually reach conclusions about what moral truth is. And so I\u2019m kind of arguing that maybe history is set up to be revelation. Mm-hmm. I mean, I also kept thinking about a conversation I had quite a few years ago with a South African cosmologist named George Ellis. And he believes that \u2014 he\u2019s Quaker and he\u2019s a scientist. He analyzes even social justice by way of mathematics, but he believes that there are moral truths that are embedded in the fabric of the universe the way the laws of physics are embedded in the fabric of the universe, which is to say, not there for us to invent but to discover. Right. And he sees some of these core moral underpinnings that have different vocabularies and different practices attached to them but that recur in the great traditions as a kind of evidence of that. So that religious people across the ages have been explorers and excavators of that. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s compatible with what you\u2019re saying. I think so. And I think, you know, the fact that hey show up in these different traditions \u2014 Buddhist scripture, the earliest actually concrete manifestation of Buddhist scripture occurs during a reign of the Emperor Ashoka in circumstances very much like the Roman Empire, and it\u2019s good news to me if indeed this kind of growth of social organization leads people toward moral truth. And then another way to look at it would be through the eyes of process theology, which you probably know, which would say, in fact, that God did change and that God changes in relationship with humanity which has free will. And, you know, relationship is I think is also what gets lost in this materialist view because the story that\u2019s being told, I mean, especially in the Hebrew Bible is not just of God evolving or what\u2019s happening with human beings, but of that relational evolution. Yeah. I don\u2019t know process theology as well as I should but, you know, that\u2019s a view and then there is the view that God is kind of evolving in us in a certain sense. Mm-hmm. It seems to me that religion in anything like the traditional sense needs to mean a little more than that. Let me ask you a question about personal evolution. When you walked down that aisle to commit your life to Jesus as a Southern Baptist, how old were you, seven, eight? Eight or nine, I think. And then you had that experience years later at a silent meditation retreat. Were those experiences similar? Were they kindred? Yes. I mean, first of all, I think in a certain sense I was drawn to the retreat by a need for salvation that I think has roots in my Christian upbringing. As it happened, this particular Buddhist retreat was in a building that had once been used \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was for nuns or priests, but to train somebody. So as you walk in the meditation hall every day, there were stained glass images of Jesus on either side of you. So you felt at home. I absolutely felt at home. It really \u2014 and I had one really intense, seemed like a breakthrough meditative experience at about day four or five in the first retreat that just felt like kind of coming home. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Evolution of God,\u201D with journalist and scholar Robert Wright. We spoke before a live audience at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Political scientist Michael Barnett of the Humphrey Institute moderated questions from the audience both live and online. Is religion dangerous? Human life is potentially dangerous and religion is an example, but an argument largely implicit in the book but in some cases explicit is that religious conflict is not fundamentally about religion. OK. I\u2019ve had this argument with Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and other kind of famous so-called new atheists. You know, Richard Dawkins made the statement in his book The God Delusion that if it weren\u2019t for religion there would be no Israel/Palestine conflict. Which I think is just wrong. If you know the history, it started out as a dispute about land. It wasn\u2019t fundamentally religious. And, in fact, the Zionists who started Israel were not religious. Were secular, yeah. And to the extent that they made reference to the Bible as justification for Israel being their homeland, it was more in the way of a historical document. In other words, here\u2019s the evidence that our people were here. That was the logic. And then once the conflict started it was, again, at first the Palestinian resistance was fundamentally secular. It\u2019s a classic zero-sum game, an argument about land. Brings out the worst in people. Now, as you let these things fester and don\u2019t resolve them, they can acquire a religious character, but religion is not the driver of that thing. And I think it\u2019s dangerous to look at world affairs with that kind of emphasis on religion as a prime mover because what it leads you to do is throw up your hands and say, \u201CYou know, it\u2019s in their scripture. There\u2019s no hope. You know, it makes them hate.\u201D I think fundamentally the so-called religious conflicts have their origin in political and economic factors and that is the place to intervene to stop them. On a slightly different topic, which concerns more in some sense to the work you\u2019ve done here but also previously on the relationship between religion and science, what parallels and connection would you draw between the current spiritual but not religious trend and what is happening in the scientific community? Yeah, I think in a way that kind of clich\u00C3\u00A9 spiritual but not religious, which apparently is the thing that more and more people say to describe themselves, is in a way an attempt to reconcile in some cases with science. In other words, the idea is, well, if I say I believe in this highly anthropomorphic God, if I\u2019m religious in too old-fashioned a sense or buy into specific claims of revelation, that might not sit well with kind of the modern scientific intelligence. So I guess I think that\u2019s a very good question and I think there is a connection between the two. Yeah. I think this is kind of related \u2014 it seems to me there is a bit of an evolution of science right now, not necessarily towards scientists believing in God but science taking some of these religious virtues seriously, you know, studying empathy, studying compassion, studying forgiveness. Yeah. And, I mean, one thing they\u2019re finding out is it\u2019s in our genes. Yeah. And this is another, I mean, the whole argument that I would make if you were willing to sit here for, you know, several months, would involve biological evolution as well. I mean, again, straightforward Darwinian version of biological evolution, materialist, leads you to the conclusion, I think, that, you know, the kind of genes for love were in the cards. They were very likely to show up. Certainly the idea that altruism was a very likely outcome of evolution and even the ability, the tendency to extend your altruism beyond the family and your compassion beyond the family, there are biologists who disagree but it wouldn\u2019t get you expelled from the church of Darwin to say it. Right. What do we gain by attributing a direction and purpose of the unknown answers to the greatest questions? Well, that\u2019s interesting because, you know, some people don\u2019t care whether there\u2019s a purpose, and they are able to have lives that they consider spiritual without that. And maybe the reason I\u2019m so hung up on this purpose question is because I was brought up a Southern Baptist. You know, when there\u2019s a God there\u2019s a purpose. At the same time, I do think there is certainly evidence that, in a more mundane sense, at least, people\u2019s lives are more meaningful to the extent that they feel part of a purpose. You know, it can be part of a basketball team. It can be part of a business. You know, I have been told that not everyone needs a sense of higher purpose or transcendent purpose. I have a friend who\u2019s very energized by the fact that, you know, some of the elements in stars are some of the elements that make us up so we are stardust. You know, some of you may have heard this and this gives her tremendous spiritual sustenance. I totally don\u2019t get it. You know, it just doesn\u2019t do it for me, but what does it for me doesn\u2019t do it for her. So we\u2019re both doing OK. You know, I had a lot of fun reading your first book, Three Scientists and Their Gods. Three Scientists and Their Gods. Well, God bless you. There aren\u2019t many people who can say they have done that. I have. And, you know, I just want to bring it up here because it\u2019s kind of related to the first scientist who you talk about, absolutely fascinating, Edward Fredkin. Mm-hmm. Who thinks of God as a computer programmer, as the cause and prime mover of everything. You have a statement of him. He said, \u201CI don\u2019t believe there is a God. I\u2019m not an agnostic. I\u2019m just in a simple state. I don\u2019t know what there is or might be, but on the other hand, what I can say is it seems likely to me that this particular universe we have is a consequence of something which I would call intelligent.\u201D And, I mean, that\u2019s not quite neutral. No. That\u2019s not quite completely disinterested. But it struck me, from my conversations with scientists across the years, that seemed to be, I think, a place a lot of scientists end up and it\u2019s just not the burning question for them, needing to pin down what that intelligence is \u2026 No. \u2026 or what its purpose is or whether you would call it God or not. No. And I had forgotten that particular quote but, yeah, he had this idea that the universe itself is best thought of as a computer algorithm, specifically a cellular automaton. And so kind of like me, except I\u2019m dealing more at the organic level, biological evolution / cultural evolution, he\u2019s dealing at the physical and largely inanimate level. But kind of like me, he says, you know, it just seems to be something that was set up to do something. Again from online: \u201CAs a teacher at a parochial Jesuit high school, I hear a lot of immature adolescent concepts of God. But I\u2019m not completely sure what a mature idea of God might be. The idea that emerges from Psalms may come close, but I\u2019d be interested in your opinion.\u201D One thing that I would say a mature conception of God does not involve is the idea that God is focused on your own interest to the exclusion of other people\u2019s interest. So, you know, that this team won the football game because, you know, you\u2019ve heard the post-game interviews. Maybe you could make a case with New Orleans and the Super Bowl, actually. But that\u2019s a special \u2026 You\u2019re doing this in Minnesota so it\u2019s a bad \u2026 Oh, yeah. It\u2019s a little raw here. You\u2019re just getting over a very tough \u2014 well, for me, of course, I saw memories of the Ice Bowl when Bart Starr did the quarterback sneak to the disadvantage of the Dallas Cowboys. So the closest I can get to revenge is having a former Green Bay quarterback whose name sounds kind of like Bart Starr \u2026 Bart Starr, yeah. \u2026 not get to the Super Bowl. But I did not wish that. I did not wish that. But you\u2019re saying it may be part of the moral order. Yeah. Right. Do we have to get back to God? I think they were starting to get into it. The secular equivalent of that is, even if you\u2019re not religious, just letting go of the idea that you\u2019re more important than everyone else. We are designed by natural selection to think we\u2019re more important. That\u2019s what animals do, you know, is they are machines for getting their genes into the next generation and obviously a process whose criterion of design is that is going to instill each animal the sense that it\u2019s special. And in the slightest ways we all go around following that assumption all the time. You know, when you\u2019re trying to flag down a taxi and the person next to you and you\u2019re trying to raise your arm higher than them, implicit in that in a way is the idea that it\u2019s more important that you catch the cab than that they catch the cab. It\u2019s not a tremendously immoral thing to do. I\u2019m not saying that, to try to catch a cab. But in all kind of subtle ways we privilege ourselves above others without realizing it and to some extent you have to do that to get by in life. I mean, my job is to raise my family, and society works better when somebody thinks that way. That\u2019s OK, but there are all these kinds of unconscious bias we have toward our own interest. And I think if you get beyond that, you\u2019re making moral progress. And if your conception of God helps you get beyond that, that\u2019s a more mature conception of God. Do you have any metaphors or words, language, images that are there for you when you think about this if you take this word God seriously? You know, it\u2019s funny. I actually, although I gave up my Southern Baptist faith and my Christian faith, the residue of it is so strongly with me that I live my life with kind of this image of this guy in the sky passing judgment on me. Right. I mean, that\u2019s the form that my conscience takes to this day. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what God is if there\u2019s a God but in some ways it works. And in the book I do have this kind of afterword that\u2019s really \u2026 Right. What is God anyway, or something like that? Well, I forget what I called it, which is not a good sign I guess. Oh, \u201CBy the Way, What is God?\u201D Yeah. But the argument is that even if God is not a personal being, thinking of God as a personal being may be a valid belief in somewhat the sense that it is valid to conceive of electrons the way that we conceive them. OK. So what I mean by that is this. Quantum physics is showing us that the kind of textbook, you know, idea of an electron, little ball, doesn\u2019t hold up ultimately. Like in quantum physics, electrons start behaving in really weird ways that literally defy certainly common-sense logic. And there are some scientists who will say, \u201CLook. I don\u2019t think electrons really exist.\u201D OK? \u201CIt\u2019s useful to think of them as existing. It\u2019s useful for them to build computers with that image in mind of an electron, but I don\u2019t think they really exist.\u201D In other words, what they\u2019re saying is the way we think of an electron is as close as we can get to whatever an electron is, given the constraints on the human ability to conceive of things. After all, we weren\u2019t designed to think of subatomic physics accurately. That\u2019s not what natural selection built us for. Well, natural selection also didn\u2019t build us to conceive of some source of the moral order that may be in some sense outside of the universe. You know, natural selection did equip us to think about other animate beings as the source of things. And so it may be that when people think of God as a personal thing, that\u2019s as close as you can get, given the constraints of human cognition. And maybe it\u2019s not something you should apologize for because you\u2019re doing the best you can with very limited equipment. And if it works, I mean, to me the test of a conception of God is what kind of person does it turn you into. Robert Wright. Thank you for being here tonight. Thank you. And thank you all for coming. Thank you. Here, in closing, are the final lines of the afterword titled \u201CBy the Way, What is God,\u201D in Robert Wright\u2019s book The Evolution of God. \u201CThough we can no more conceive of God than we can conceive of an electron, believers can ascribe properties to God. \u2026 One of the more plausible such properties is love. And maybe, in this light, the argument for God is strengthened by love\u2019s organic association with truth. \u2026 You might say that love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake, and that by partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine. Then again, you might not say that. The point is just that you wouldn\u2019t have to be crazy to say it.\u201D On our Web site, you can read this and other passages I especially enjoyed from Robert Wright\u2019s book The Evolution of God. And we\u2019ve also put up some passages from his delightful but out-of-print early book, Three Scientists and Their God. One of those scientists was the sociobiologist E.O. Wilson. He and Wright connected around big ideas and their common Southern Baptist roots. We also had fun reading the hundreds of fantastic questions and thoughts many of you submitted in advance of my live event with Robert Wright. I drew on them as I prepared for the interview. So there\u2019s already a lively conversation on The Evolution of God happening on our Web site, through our blog, and on our Facebook fan page. To join in with your ideas or your reactions to Robert Wright\u2019s ideas, look for links on our home page, speakingoffaith.org. And there you will also find information about my new book, Einstein\u2019s God, just out direct to paperback in all the usual places. It\u2019s a reflection of my ongoing exploration of the interface between science and the human spirit, from quantum physics to clinical psychology. Again, go to speakingoffaith.org."
