  "fullText": "danah boyd is a blogger and technologist on one of the most intriguing fields of 21st century life \u2014 the intersection of technology and society. She\u2019s steeped in emerging research around the social lives of networked teens, the topic of her book, It\u2019s Complicated. I wanted to see what would happen, not at the margins, not at the edges, not at the grand level, but what happens when these technologies are just a part of life. And part of that technological perspective is also because there were all of these great hopes and dreams \u2014 the internet would be this magical transformation, it would create a level of egalitarianism, it would bring about the next Enlightenment \u2014 all of these big dreams. And what intrigued me was that as these technologies became part of everyday life, what we saw is that people brought with them all of their flaws, all of their everyday concerns and interests. And that\u2019s what makes it really tricky, because we want to see the extremes, but the practices themselves are just about what it says about humanity. danah boyd\u2019s observations and advice are often counterintuitive; for example, that our children\u2019s immersion in social media may offer a kind of respite from their over-structured, overscheduled analog lives, and that cyber-bullying is an online reflection of the offline world, and blaming technology is missing the point. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. danah boyd is principal researcher at Microsoft Research and the founder of the Data & Society research institute. She\u2019s also walking on digital frontiers as the mother of young children. I spoke with her in 2015. I start all my conversations, whoever I\u2019m speaking with, with this question. And I\u2019m curious, because I didn\u2019t read anything about this in your \u2014 I didn\u2019t read much about it in your autobiographical stuff. So I just wonder if there was a religious or spiritual background to your childhood or how you would describe that. It\u2019s an interesting and challenging question, in part because my mother was very Catholic and very much believed in the Catholic Church, and then she and my father divorced. And so part of what was interesting for me growing up in light of that, my mother\u2019s being kicked out of the church, trying to make sense of it, is that it forced me into a lot of questioning. What did religion mean to me? What did community mean to me? How did I think about these things? And I was one of those teenagers who actually spent a lot of time trying to explore and make sense of it. But it\u2019s one of those strange dynamics where I\u2019ve had such a deep appreciation for the role of religion and spirituality in people\u2019s lives, but I\u2019ve never really found my own common ground with it. It\u2019s been more cultural and very much dependent on the people around me. So what year were you born? I was born in 1977. Okay. So this is the way I wrote the question out, and I hope it makes sense to you. I wondered, how would you begin to tell the story of the emergence of immersive social technologies \u2014 what we mean, these days, when we talk about technology and how it\u2019s changing our lives? How would you begin to tell that story in our lives, collectively, through the story of your life? So my brother got access to a computer when he was in middle school, and I didn\u2019t understand what this piece of equipment was for or why he would spend so much time on it. And then he did the terribly horrible thing to a teenaged sister, where he hooked it up to a phone line and used up the phone line to make horrible beeping sounds. Of course, this is early-day modems. And I remember I marched into his room one day. I\u2019m like, \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D And I was upset, and I was like, \u201CGet off the phone. Your computer should not be making sounds into the phone.\u201D And he showed me different online bulletin boards, and all of a sudden I realized that this computer was made out of people. And the computer became much more interesting to me, once it was made out of people. And so alongside my brother, he ended up introducing me to a whole different world. I spent my teenage years in some of those early online communities, BBSs and Usenet and different kinds of chat rooms. So this would be late \u201980s, early \u201990s, into the \u201990s? This is early \u201990s. And I still remember my brother bringing home a book, and it would have been 1994, and it was a Yellow Pages of every single webpage out there, but I\u2019m entering this at a time when everything is about to shift, only I don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m not aware of that when I\u2019m entering into it. And the early adopters of those social technologies, the part that I was at the tail end of, were self-identified geeks, freaks, and queers. And I was all three, so it felt really comfortable and quite at home. But it wasn\u2019t something that was remotely cool. In fact, I think that if it was cool, I would want nothing to do with it. It was the fact that it was a totally separate practice, and it introduced me to a world that was much larger than my hometown, and I loved that. And I was a part of that cohort that imagined that I should, therefore, build these systems, which is how I studied computer science to begin with. Oh, gosh. You know, it\u2019s so interesting. I mean reading you kind of brought me back to my own story, and it was kind of interesting, as we probably all \u2014 each of us has a story of our life with technology, because it is so social now. But I remember \u2014 I graduated from college \u2014 I also went to Brown, like you. And students had access to the \u201Ccomputer center\u201D or something, and so we all gave away our time, because we couldn\u2019t imagine why we would have wanted to spend any time with these computers. And then I remember graduating in \u201983, and these predictions were out there about personal computers. I mean even then, everything was typed on a typewriter, and those predictions about personal computers, even into the mid-\u201980s, sounded absurd. So I mean I think it\u2019s \u2014 gosh, it\u2019s so important to just take note of how recent this change is. Ms. boyd: I\u2019ll never forget, I was giving a talk to a group of middle schoolers, and I asked them to submit questions ahead of time. And this one young boy, he submitted a question of \u201CWho \u2018found\u2019 the internet?\u201D Not who founded, not who invented, but who found it. It was clearly something out there, that somebody must have embarked on a long journey and somehow stumbled across and found it. MS. TIPPETT: That is so interesting. And I was like, that\u2019s amazing. It just made my heart totally melt. Well, it\u2019s like the question of whether Einstein discovered or invented the law of relativity, like whether mathematics is discovered or invented, that for this generation, the internet is so much in the fabric of things. Absolutely. Absolutely. It\u2019s just there. And I think that that reality of it, just connecting people to information \u2014 it\u2019s that moment where you\u2019re like \u2014 you\u2019re talking to someone, and they\u2019re like, \u201CWell, how did you look up information before this? How did you know where to go?\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CThere were these things called maps, paper maps.\u201D And they\u2019re like, \u201CHuh. I\u2019m not sure I believe you.\u201D I know. I love that. So you\u2019ve written about \u2014 you\u2019ve written in a few places that the internet actually was a very transformative and kind of redemptive thing in your high school years, that it helped you survive. So as a teenager, I didn\u2019t really belong in my high school. I didn\u2019t fit in. I wasn\u2019t comfortable. I always felt like I was on the outskirts of things. Maybe some of that is me, maybe that is something of my peers, but I just really didn\u2019t feel like I belonged. And I really struggled with it. And one of the things that the Internet allowed me to do is, it allowed me to connect to people around the globe. This is before we were afraid of strangers. And in fact, my mother was of this mindset that any use of a computer must be educational, because that was the only reason one would have a computer, so would ignore what I did late at night, because she just figured it was educational. Oh, that\u2019s so interesting too. And so I ended up connecting to all of these people. And there are two connections that are most memorable for me. One was with a transgender woman, and as I was trying to figure out my own sexuality and my gender identity and trying to make sense of who I was, here\u2019s this woman who was allowing me to ask wholly inappropriate questions. But she also understood that I was a teenager and that I was open. And so we ended up having these crazy dialogues about gender, about sexuality, about how the two come into conversation \u2014 and it was absolutely mind-blowing for me. And I never met her. I don\u2019t know much about her other than what she told me. But it didn\u2019t matter, because she opened my eyes in such critical ways. The other conversation that was absolutely essential during that period was that I had intended to go into the military, and this was during the first Iraq War. And a young man who was serving over in Iraq was just talking to me about what it was like to be a soldier and what the military was like and what his experiences were like and how he was trying to make sense of life in the Middle East. And again, it was not somebody I was ever looking to meet or to connect with in any physical sense, but somebody who allowed me to see something that I literally couldn\u2019t see in my hometown. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with technologist danah boyd. Her blog is Apophenia. When did you start your blog? So we were all messing around with HTML in different ways. I had already created an Ani DiFranco lyrics page. I guess that would have been circa \u201995. Which still exists. Ms. boyd: Which still exists. Ms. Tippett: It\u2019s a repository for every \u2014 all the lyrics Ani DiFranco has ever written. Ms. boyd: And for my own \u2014 it\u2019s all for me, because I really wanted to be able to access them at any point when I needed to scream, and I use those song lyrics all the time. But I\u2019m glad they\u2019re useful to other people too. So when I was at Brown in \u201996, I was messing around with all sorts of different things about HTML. I was working on some of the early hypertext mechanisms at that time, and in the process, I ended up taking a class, an independent study in the religious studies department with a teacher who was thinking about Buddhism and the role that Buddhism could provide in spiritual understandings. And he ended up transitioning before the class would begin, and he moved out of state. And so we decided to keep this class up as an independent study, and so he asked us to find a way to communicate with him, everyday reflections. And this was in the spring of \u201997. Totally unaware of what was going to come, I created each page as a day, and I had forward and backward buttons, and so you could have these posts. And then I had a calendar, and you could click on the calendar and see any one of those pages. And after this class was done, I found that this practice was so meditative for me. It was so valuable to reflect on what I was seeing, what I was thinking about, how I was feeling, that I kept it up, with an audience of about one, for many, many years. And was it called Apophenia then, as well? It didn\u2019t have a title, to the best that I knew. I loved that term. Yeah, and where did you discover that term? And, yeah, say what that means. Oh. So apophenia is about making connections where none previously existed, and it\u2019s usually referring to a cognitive disorder where there are synaptic connections made in unpredictable ways. And people often know this through Oliver Sacks\u2019s work, \u201Cthe man is the hat\u201D kind of thing. And I just \u2014 I loved the concept, because I felt as though that was the very essence of what thinking was about, was making these unpredictable connections. So one of the ways you talk about the focus of your work is that you\u2019re interested in everyday practices involving social media and that you enjoy watching the evolution of practice. And I think those are interesting phrases. And I think what I\u2019m interested in kind of delving into with you is the evolution of us as human beings and technology becoming part of that in new ways, becoming part of human relationship and identity in new ways. And one of the things you point out very articulately is that a lot of the things we bemoan about our lives with technology and the change it\u2019s bringing are not so new. I mean you have this great sentence: \u201CEven the most fleeting acquaintance with the history of information and communication technologies indicates that moral panics are episodic and should be taken with a grain of salt.\u201D So part of why I got into the idea of everyday life was, I\u2019m really enamored by a sociologist named Erving Goffman. He was one of my great influences in terms of a lot of how I think about things. And he moved, in a sociological sense, from thinking about these large structural systems to just the everyday practices, and he\u2019s known for thinking about the mundane in many ways and helping people untangle and make sense of it. And even when I realized that technology was understood to be this radical transformation, and all of these hopes and dreams and fears and anxieties were placed on it, I also realized we were going to move more and more into a world in which technology would just be mundane. And indeed, for teenagers, they look at you like you\u2019re an alien if you\u2019re just like, \u201COh, my gosh, this is the most amazing thing ever.\u201D They\u2019re like, \u201CIt\u2019s a phone. I know what a phone is. I\u2019ve used a phone for a long time. Why is this a big deal?\u201D Right. And so I wanted to see what would happen, not at the margins, not at the edges, not at the grand level, but what happens when these technologies are just a part of life. How do people use them? How do they integrate them into all of their practices? And part of that technological perspective is also because there were all of these great hopes and dreams \u2014 the Internet would be this magical transformation, it would create a level of egalitarianism, it would be the freeing democratic mechanism for the world writ large, it would bring about the next Enlightenment \u2014 all of these big dreams. And I sort of scratched my head, being like, \u201CI\u2019m not sure this is how this is going to play out.\u201D And what intrigued me was that as these technologies became part of everyday life, what we saw is that people brought with them all of their flaws, all of their everyday concerns and interests. And that\u2019s what makes it really tricky, because we want to see the extremes, but the practices themselves are just about what it says about humanity. I mean there\u2019s another great sentence of yours, that \u201Cthe internet mirrors, magnifies, and makes more visible the good, bad, and the ugly of everyday life,\u201D and that also what you\u2019re saying, that pain and prejudice offline translate into pain and prejudice online, and likewise, community and all kinds of good things \u2014 good things offline translate into online. It\u2019s the fullness of who we are. Yeah, and then how do we read it, right? And this is where I think \u2014 I get worried. That\u2019s that visibility marker, which is that we read meanness and cruelty, for example, and we say, \u201COh, my gosh, bullying must be so much worse because of the internet,\u201D even as the data shows otherwise. We read prejudice online, and we\u2019re like, \u201COh, my gosh, it must be the internet that\u2019s causing us to be a racist society,\u201D without realizing that we are a racist society, and we\u2019re just making it visible online. And it doesn\u2019t take Ferguson for us to remember that. And so I think that this is where it\u2019s this moment of saying, oh, my gosh, we have this tool that allows us to step out of our own assumptions about what the world is like and try to make sense of it. And then we have to get strategic about how to really address the things in society we don\u2019t like. I happen to be very violently opposed to prejudice and racism. This is something I would like to see us address. But rather than flipping out at the technology, I want us to get at the systemic issues. I want us to get at the underlying issues that affect what we see visibly online. And I think that the worst thing we can do is just clamp down on the visibility, because that\u2019s not how we actually address the core issues here. Right. And so a lot of the hand-wringing, and I know that you pay a lot of attention to this, comes on the part of parents. And one of the things you say that again gets back to that kind of everyday level is that social media in kids\u2019 lives \u2014 I mean I\u2019m paraphrasing \u2014 but in a sense is a kind of antidote to over-structured, overscheduled lives that we, the world of adults, have created for children now. Ms. boyd: One of the anxieties I heard whenever I was out in the field was, it was like, \u201COh my gosh, kids these days. What\u2019s wrong with them? Why don\u2019t they just go outside like we did when we were kids?\u201D Right. Go outside and play, yeah. Go outside and play. And then from \u2014 when I would talk to teenagers, they would look at me and be like, \u201CI would love to have the freedom to just go out and play with all my friends, but I can\u2019t.\u201D And then they\u2019d start listing off all of these different reasons. And I started stepping back and going, wow, I need to untangle where this disconnect is. And I realized that over the last 30 years, a lot has changed about American society. We have a tremendous amount of fearmongering that emerged in light of 24/7 news, like the 1980s were filled with the introduction of all sorts of laws around curfew and anti-loitering and anti-trespassing. We created this concern that public spaces like the park were a terrible, terrible place. We were worried about latchkey kids. We were worried about school buses. We clamped down on young people, and we started, especially in middle to upper class environments, structuring every day of their lives. We increased the levels of homework. We put tremendous amounts of pressure on young people. And all they want to do is just hang out with their friends. And part of what made it so visible to me is, it wasn\u2019t just a matter of them getting on their bike and going out and being home by dark, which was the old way. It was the fact that they need all of their other friends to be allowed to do so too. And that\u2019s where we started to see that difficulty \u2014 because even if a parent was like, \u201COh, you have flexibility,\u201D if your friends don\u2019t, there\u2019s no point. And along comes this technology. And this technology all of a sudden is like, \u201CI know I can get to my friends and my broader peer group, even when I\u2019m stuck at home, even when our timing is slightly off because of our structured schedules being slightly different. And I know that they\u2019re there.\u201D And all of a sudden, you see a social technology being able to work as a mediator in light of all of these other cultural conditions that we\u2019ve forgotten that we created. Ms. Tippett: So, do we similarly \u2014 is it your sense that we similarly overemphasize the dangers involved in roaming around the internet? And also, are we in danger of over-regulating that or regulating it in a way that doesn\u2019t make sense? From my perspective, absolutely. And this is where, again, you start to look at the data \u2014 usually, when we talk about dangers online, we hit a couple of different areas. It\u2019s usually conduct, contact, and content. Those are the three C\u2019s. Conduct is where we get worried about bullying. When we untangle all of what\u2019s going on around there, we find that young people are really struggling, writ large, with bullying, but they\u2019re not actually seeing the internet as anything other than a support network in light of it. And of course, there are exceptions to this. And that\u2019s part of what makes people anxious. Ms. Tippett: But also, I actually have read you and heard you speaking about this in ways that I think turn that on its head a bit, because I think that some of your research suggests \u2014 I mean as you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the offline world that finds reflection in the online world. Ms. boyd: And this goes back to why we should be using the visibility to address it. We know that much of what needs to happen has to happen educationally. It has to happen culturally. But that\u2019s much harder. But yet, that\u2019s what we need to do if we\u2019re going to change this. And so instead, we try to clamp down on the technology. We try to go after the most extreme cases and extrapolate from there. We try to find new ways of punishing people. But this is not going to address the issue. And I guess I \u2014 at the end of the day, I am concerned about addressing the issue, not the symptoms. Ms. Tippett: Which is the way human beings treat other human beings. And then, doesn\u2019t some of your research also suggest that young people actually use that visibility of the internet to create phenomena that other people will see, that they kind of \u2014 what have you called it? Ms. boyd: Drama. Ms. Tippett: Yeah, right, or even self-bullying, that they make this stuff up, because they can\u2019t get attention to it in real life. Ms. boyd: Well, they\u2019re looking for attention. And so the issue of self-bullying that I looked at and then another researcher named Elizabeth Englander looked at in more detail, emerged because of a question-and-answer service called Formspring. And that evolved into something called ask.fm. And I was looking at this, and I understood the technology enough to be really struggling with the media narrative. The media narrative was, like, this is a terrible site where everybody is just bullying each other anonymously. But the thing about that site was that in order for a question, a cruel question to appear, somebody needed to choose to answer it. And so I was sitting there going, \u201CWhy would somebody answer a cruel question about themselves?\u201D And so I went to Formspring, and I said, \u201CCan you help me figure this out?\u201D And they found that the same IP address asked the question as answered it \u2014 basically, the same computer \u2014 and that it would do so under 20 minutes. In other words, it was most likely a young person asking themselves a cruel question and then answering it back to themselves. But in public, kind of, right? In public. And I was really struggling with this. And so then, between me and Elizabeth, we delved into it in different ways, and we found that young people had to show that they were tough, they could handle anything. And they also had to \u2014 they loved that moment of getting all of the love and attention that would come back from it \u2014 \u201CYou\u2019re awesome. Don\u2019t listen to those anonymous people. I think you\u2019re the best,\u201D et cetera, et cetera. Now part of it is also \u2014 put those kinds of practices in a broader context of drama and the kinds of interpersonal conflict that we see all over the place. And what I started to realize was that this is the message they\u2019re receiving all over the place about how adults interact. We call it politics. We call it reality TV. We call it news. And we make a level of aggression and critique and tearing people apart part of the national pastime. Ms. Tippett: And melodrama rather than substance. Ms. boyd: Right. But we also see it in our homes. And I would sit in people\u2019s homes, and I would be startled by these parents who would lament bullying as a major issue, and then they\u2019d sit there and talk poorly about their colleagues at work and their neighbors \u2014 and I\u2019m just sitting here going, \u201CDo you realize what you\u2019re modeling?\u201D Ms. Tippett: But do you think there might be some actually really positive side to this, and to the internet in particular, in that when these things get amplified and put out into public, and sometimes with really terrible consequences that we can\u2019t help but see together, that it actually \u2014 in this sense, social media and technology can be contributing to us being more honest and growing up a bit, culturally? Ms. boyd: I mean the answer is, I hope so. I will never forget this past summer \u2014 in light of everything that was happening in Ferguson, the media was covering it in pretty problematic ways, originally. And I saw a group of young black individuals decide to get up on Twitter and make a hashtag #ifIwasshot, and they would show two different pictures and then basically ask the question, \u201CWhich picture would the media show of me, depending on my skin color?\u201D or all of this. And you start to realize it was just a beautiful media critique of what was going on by trying to find a different way to speak back. And this is where there\u2019s a lot of beauty in memes. There\u2019s a lot of beauty in watching people try to amplify things that are messy. I am nervous \u2014 there\u2019s new data that has come out from the folks at Pew that show that if you have a network of people on social media who believe politically in things that are different than you, you are less likely to speak out and speak up and share your thoughts. So just because this stuff is visible and accessible doesn\u2019t mean that people want to look. Ms. Tippett: You can listen again and share this conversation with danah boyd through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. Ms. Tippett: I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with blogger and technologist danah boyd, exploring her view from the cutting edge of research on the way technology is changing life, society, and relationship between generations. She\u2019s also walking on digital frontiers as the mother of young children. She is principal researcher at Microsoft Research, and she\u2019s the author of It\u2019s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens. Ms. Tippett: So I\u2019m curious about some of the ways in which there are real human cultural shifts happening in our time and how those are maybe not so much being caused by technology, but certainly converging with technology. So for example, I just think the whole nature of identity, on so many levels, is so much more fluid than it was before. There\u2019s been this falling away, in so many aspects of life, of categories and taboos that applied in previous generations. And the fact that people have so much just hanging out there in public, online, converges with the changing nature of what is public and private, which technology presents. You know what I\u2019m talking about? And I just feel like this generation is kind of in the laboratory on that. Ms. boyd: What\u2019s unique about all of this and where it does connect into technology is that our identities and our sense of self are very much shaped by the people around us. Our mental models of the people around us, historically, were about groups. We were all part of the same town, we were all part of the same religion, we were all part of the same basketball team \u2014 these were bounded entities. One of the fabulous things that\u2019s happened because of social media is that you understand yourself to be a part of a network, that your network overlaps with, but is not identical to, your best friend\u2019s network. And so, obviously, you always understood you had different family. But at the same time, you didn\u2019t understand where these friend connections \u2014 your cousin\u2019s best friend that that you see every summer but your best friend doesn\u2019t see \u2014 all of these ways of understanding things. When all of this becomes visible through social media, you realize the power of these networks. And that\u2019s one of the things that resists back in all of this, is this awareness that we\u2019re all connected in really significant ways. But it\u2019s also what allows us to see where there are huge divisions in society. Ms. Tippett: Yeah, but I guess what I\u2019m curious about is, for example, this fluidity of identity and everything hanging out there. And right now parents \u2014 let\u2019s just come back to parents \u2014 are so concerned about what their children are putting up online right now that is going to come back to haunt them when they have their first real job interview 10 or 15 years from now. And yet, at the same time, the world is changing so that what used to be something that you had to keep secret, so many of those things in that category no longer are. I don\u2019t know. Am I being clear? I just\u2026 Ms. boyd: Yeah, I \u2014 think about it. Our last three U.S. presidents \u2014 \u201CI smoked and didn\u2019t inhale.\u201D \u201CYes, I did cocaine, but then I found God.\u201D And \u201CI was young, get over it.\u201D Right. Right. Exactly. That\u2019s an interesting transition. For a lot of today\u2019s young people, they\u2019re going to be able to live down their past. And we\u2019re all going to have made mistakes, and it\u2019s going to be funny, and there\u2019s things we laugh at, and it\u2019s no big deal. Where trouble occurs are for those who actually lack privilege already, and then they\u2019re automatically put at risk in a totally different way. Ms. Tippett: What do you mean? Ms. boyd: And the further they have to \u2014 Ms. Tippett: How is that? Explain that. Ms. boyd: So let me give a concrete example here. In the early days of Myspace, when it was the cool technology, I received a phone call from an Ivy League admissions officer. And they had accepted a young man living in South Central who\u2019d written a beautiful essay about wanting to leave behind the gangs he\u2019d grown up with. And they were very proud of the fact that they were using social media to learn more about applicants. They felt that this made them more informed as admissions officers. But they went to his to his profile, and they found that it was filled with gang insignias. And so they asked me a question: \u201CWhy would he lie to us when we can tell the truth online?\u201D Now I\u2019ve spent enough time in South Central to know that this young man probably was living in a context where his cousins, his family members, his friends, the extended network in which he was living were all gang-affiliated. In other words, it would be a survival tactic and that he probably wasn\u2019t lying to the admissions officer, he just was trying to navigate two wildly different contexts simultaneously, which is extraordinarily difficult. And what happens, and the reason why we get anxious about how to read stuff from the past is because we imagine the context of you hanging out with your friends and the context of you applying for a job to be two radically different contexts. And this is true for some people, but it is more true for others. And for most privileged young people, yeah, we\u2019re going to look up and see the things they did when they were 16, and, boy, are they going to look dumb when they were 16. And it\u2019s going to be something that we can laugh about. And this is one of the reasons why I think that it \u2014 the burden is not on us to help young people figure out how to imagine every possible future context \u2014 nobody can live that way. No adult can live that way, let alone a young person who has a long path to navigate. The burden should be on all of us to think about what are we doing when we interpret the data that we see, how do we understand people in the context they were in and understand that people change and that no matter what, you\u2019re not your 16-year-old self. I probably wouldn\u2019t hire your 16-year-old self, but I want to hire you now. So how do you think about that transition? Ms. Tippett: And so just to make this personal, you have a piece on your website, which is called \u201Can itty-bitty autobiography / smattering of facts,\u201D which is just so interesting, so granular in some ways, so much more of an introduction of yourself, which is in a space that is, at one in the same time, professional and personal. I mean it\u2019s a new phenomenon \u2014 I mean you\u2019re not alone in that, but that younger generations present themselves to the world with a fullness and a lack of inhibition that I really do think is actually new in human history. And even that transparency and integrity, and that those two things are connected, are kind of moral values, virtues for new generations. Ms. boyd: But this is where I also know that I have the privilege to be able to do that. I have a computer science degree. I have an Ivy League degree. I can get away with so much, and I am painfully aware of that. And so I have no compulsion to hide any aspect of myself, because I can make a decision not to be in a place who doesn\u2019t accept me as who I am. And it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019m also fully aware of how the mistakes that I made in the past are part of the present. And so as I mentioned, I started this blog in 1997. And if you go back to those early posts, you will quickly find that the date is much later than what I just initially explained it as, as the beginning of the school semester. And the reason is, is that I deleted many of those posts. I deleted many of those posts, and I struggled with it, not because I was ashamed of anything that I posted, but because I opened up that blog talking about navigating the issues of rape on a personal level, talking about how I navigated other harassment issues, really abusive situations. And so this is also where it\u2019s really tricky, of how do you modify these moments of self-presentation? You figure out how to find the right context in which to portray certain things and how to shift over time. What can you control? What can\u2019t you control? There\u2019s a lot \u2014 I can\u2019t control what a search engine brings up as the top thing. So how do I figure out how to navigate that, and how do I recognize where I have privilege and where I don\u2019t, and how do I find a way to communicate that holistically to somebody else? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with blogger and technologist danah boyd. Ms. Tippett: And so again, bringing this to life and to the question that\u2019s on so many people\u2019s minds of my generation \u2014 you\u2019ve been really clear that parents catastrophizing about the fact that their children have online lives and just trying to kind of blanket clamp down on it is not only not helpful, but potentially damaging. But how would you talk about how we \u2014 as parents or other adults in the lives of people who are living with technology in a way that is completely new and unusual to us \u2014 how we can help them become discerning and navigate that challenge that you just described between what they\u2019re putting out there and who they are and who they\u2019re going to be for the rest of their lives? Ms. boyd: I think it\u2019s about moving away from a set of prescriptions \u2014 \u201CThis is how you should act\u201D \u2014 to thinking more about how do you get young people to be critically self-reflective about every decision that they\u2019re making, and how do you get it to evolve? I\u2019ll never forget \u2014 this is the personal story of it all, which is that when I was 18, and I was off in college, I shaved my head. And I knew this was going to upset my mother. Oh, did I know this. And sure enough, I got home, and \u201COh this is terrible. You\u2019re so ugly. Don\u2019t you understand what you\u2019ve done to yourself?\u201D You know, cry, cry, cry. And of course, I\u2019m sitting here patting myself on the back, being like \u201CHa, ha, ha, ha. That was always my intention.\u201D And then, meanwhile, I go and I see my grandmother, and she takes one look at me and goes, \u201CHuh. You look like you were in the Holocaust,\u201D and walks off. Nothing was more effective at getting me to rethink what I was trying to present with this shaved head. And it\u2019s those little moments, those moments where you can get people to think, where the most transformative actions occur. And this is how I really feel we should be approaching the internet with regard to young people. We adults, we don\u2019t know it better than they do. Instead, it\u2019s how do you ask the questions that force the reflection that is actually productive? That\u2019s not the judgmental question of \u201CWhy are you doing that?\u201D But it\u2019s the question of saying, \u201CHuh, that\u2019s intriguing. Here\u2019s how I interpret it. What were you trying to achieve here?\u201D And it\u2019s this moment of dialogue. You\u2019ve said, \u201CMore conversation, less surveillance.\u201D Ms. boyd: Absolutely. And that transition requires helping them be independent, critical, thoughtful thinkers. Ms. Tippett: Yeah. Boy, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Ms. boyd: Oh, but it\u2019s hard. Ms. Tippett: It\u2019s hard, right? I mean the question is \u2014 Ms. boyd: There\u2019s no manual. Ms. Tippett: I\u2019m not necessarily sure we were great at this before social media came along. I mean these are new skills we have to learn, as a species. Ms. boyd: Well, they\u2019re skills we probably always should have learned, it\u2019s just that they become all the more important now. Ms. Tippett: Exactly. Don\u2019t you think the stakes get higher through this technology somehow? Or the \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s more intense. Ms. boyd: Well, it\u2019s also \u2014 let\u2019s be honest. This was done collectively as a society in the past, in ways where we put all the burden on parents in the nuclear family in the present. So part of what\u2019s really transitioned is not simply the technology, but it\u2019s the way we\u2019ve architected our society, where we put all of the burden for education on a very few number of adults. And this is where, when I\u2019m advising parents on how to think about raising their children, I\u2019m really \u2014 lesson number one: build out as large of a network of other adults in your child\u2019s life, from the time that they\u2019re two on up. They need that network, because at some point, they\u2019re not going to want to talk to you about something. You can\u2019t do it all yourself, and we do a disservice to our children by assuming that you can. Ms. Tippett: And the language of \u201Cdigital natives,\u201D which I know you \u2014 is problematic, and you write in very interesting ways about that, and I\u2019ve heard that recently from a few people, that that language is problematic to people who really understand the history of it. But I think that for those of us who kind of walked onto this frontier of the internet in mid-life, where we feel like we are always just trying to catch up and truly trying to learn a foreign language, and then you have children who are growing up fluent and progressing kind of beyond you \u2014 it has felt like a helpful image for me. Ms. boyd: The reason that I object to the digital natives frame is because it assumes that skills and learning just come down from the sky magically for people who were born at a certain time or are of a certain age. Young people spend a tremendous amount of time learning how to navigate these tools, these technologies, the people. They\u2019re not afraid of them, so they\u2019re willing to experiment, and their networks and friends are all willing to experiment and explore with them. But at the same time, when we use the term \u201Cdigital natives,\u201D we assume, then, that adults don\u2019t have anything to teach young people, and that is so not true. Young people don\u2019t know how to construct a query. They don\u2019t understand how information is architected. They don\u2019t necessarily understand the broader media landscape, the kinds of propaganda that go on. They don\u2019t necessarily understand biases within the algorithms that they see. And so when we hear these messages \u2014 I hear them all the time, like \u201CA site like Wikipedia is bad.\u201D And then a teenager will tell me, \u201CBut my teacher told me that Google is good.\u201D And you\u2019re just sitting here going, \u201CHow do you think that Google comes up with the answers?\u201D They\u2019re like, \u201CWell, they choose the best ones.\u201D And you\u2019re like, \u201CAnd who does this?\u201D And they\u2019re like, \u201COh, well, somebody that works at Google.\u201D And you\u2019re like, \u201CNo. That\u2019s not how this works.\u201D And so there\u2019s this moment of these \u2014 of assuming the capabilities, because they\u2019ve learned something in the social realm, will apply to everything else related to the technology. And because we have spent so much time assuming kids to be perfectly competent because they\u2019re using Instagram happily, we\u2019re not actually investing in helping them become critical and intelligible users of these tools, such that they can transfer it into something that is akin to building them. Ms. Tippett: Right. Right. I love that. I love what you\u2019re saying. And again, it\u2019s kind of applying old-fashioned, ancient wisdom that worked before to cutting-edge technologies \u2014 that even as new generations have a familiarity with something, they still need elders and mentors to learn from, whatever the medium is. Ms. boyd: I mean \u2014 absolutely. And they need time to explore. And there\u2019s a reason why more privileged youth, who have their own devices, are learning these kinds of basic social technology skills much faster than less privileged youth. This is where we start to see these unbelievable gaps in skill development, because a lot of it is not just the elders, but it\u2019s also the time and the tools to explore these things. Ms. Tippett: One thing that is fascinating for those of us who are parents \u2014 and also, I would say, even for our media project \u2014 is how the internet and the things that happen online, it seems to me that there\u2019s kind of an accelerating application of those things from offline to in-the-flesh and that even \u2014 there\u2019s all this online relationship, but then there\u2019s also this rage for convenings and for flesh-and-blood connection. Do you see that? Is that something that you observe? Ms. boyd: The person I think about is Eric Klinenberg, who\u2019s a sociologist who wrote a book called Going Solo. And the book is all about why more people live alone now, today, than ever before. And what he argues in this book is that we are oversaturated with connections with other people. Our professional worlds are far more social than they were historically, especially when you think about agricultural times or industrial times. We have the choice to connect, at any given point, through social interactions. And as a result, we choose to live alone in order to get a break from it all, which is intriguing. So I think that there\u2019s this moment where you think about how sociality works and the ways in which people are delighting in it and overwhelmed by it, and the different kinds of connections that can be made. You share a passion for Pok\u00E9mon or underwater basket weaving. You\u2019re doing a task together. And so you\u2019re really connected intellectually, which can be wonderful for certain things, but it is very different than sitting there and going blah-blah-blah-blah with your friends, right? There is something about that moment where you\u2019re not even necessarily talking, but you\u2019re seeing a movie together, or you\u2019re just having an experience together. And so where I see people playing this out is that they\u2019re thinking holistically about how to balance this personally, professionally, collectively. And you have far more choices today than you ever had before. And it used to be only you had to live in a city to have these kinds of choices, and so more and more people are grappling with it, and you have to think about how to do that now online, because it\u2019s a way of getting a break. But at the same time you still want connection, but only certain kinds of connection. And so it feels murky, but at the same time I think that it makes sense if you think about it holistically. Ms. Tippett: Yeah, we\u2019re living with this new thing, and we\u2019re having to create new boundaries and new structures to think about it. And we\u2019re having to think about it, rather than just accepting whatever defaults seem to have been in existence in the past. Ms. Tippett: So you\u2019ve used language like \u201Ccreating the networked world we all want to live in,\u201D encouraging parents to see this \u2014 social media and the internet \u2014 as an opportunity and not just a danger. What would you offer along those lines in terms of that adventure, of treating this as an opportunity, where to begin? Ms. boyd: From my perspective, it\u2019s about stepping back and not assuming that just the technology is transformative, and saying, okay, what are we trying to achieve here? What does balance look like? What does happiness look like? What does success look like? What are these core tenets or values that we\u2019re aiming for, and how do we achieve them holistically across our lives? And certainly, when parents are navigating this, I think one of the difficulties is to recognize that this is what your values are, and they may be different from your child\u2019s values. And so how do you learn to sit and have a conversation of \u201CHere\u2019s what I want for you. What do you want? And how do we balance that?\u201D And that\u2019s that negotiation that\u2019s really hard. And so I think about it in terms of all of us \u2014 how do you find your own sense of grounding? People are always shocked with me, because I\u2019m one of the biggest proponents of technology \u2014 I love it \u2014 and yet, I also take an annual email sabbatical. Ms. Tippett: I wanted to ask you about that. Ms. boyd: So I take this time each year where I don\u2019t just bounce my message and send a nice vacation mail like most people do, but I literally bounce it. You cannot send me email during that period. And it sends a pretty hysterical message, basically saying, \u201CThe goblins have gobbled up all of the email. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019ll never get to me.\u201D And it sends you different options, and it says you can contact me after this date, you can send me snail mail, or you can call my mother. And anybody who knows to call my mother knows that that\u2019s going to be, like, a minimum three-hour call, so it\u2019s an ongoing joke between all of us, including my mother, who\u2019s always like, \u201CAnd why are random strangers calling me?\u201D I\u2019m like, \u201CHa,ha. Here we go.\u201D But the reason that that email sabbatical is really important for me is, it forces me to think about time. I don\u2019t just disappear. I go through all these steps to communicate with everybody that depends on me and make certain that they have what they need from me before I leave, rather than assuming I will always be in contact, which is \u2014 that\u2019s the danger of the \u201Calways-on\u201D environment, is that when you\u2019re always assumed, then you never close things down. You never take care of your communication with people. So I start this many months in advance. And then I communicate to people about the fact that I\u2019ll be gone. And then I do turn off my email. And the big joke \u2014 because I\u2019m a Unix geek, and I have all the procmail scripts, and so I have the logs, which show that very few people email me, because they get it. We\u2019ve negotiated this out ahead of time. And it allows me to go offline and think about reflecting in a different way. And I find that extraordinarily valuable, because I get to rethink and re-center. And it\u2019s not just that I physically break from the internet. I leave my home environment. I live in New York City, which is a bustling, insane city. And I go hiking into a place where there are no people for hours, and that is totally acceptable. And I purposely shake up my entire worldview in order to find grounding, in order to find balance. And so part of why I say this reflection is that these technologies are out there. There are so many opportunities out there to connect, to communicate, to get information. We need to be more thoughtful about what we want to achieve and how to articulate that in our lives and how to achieve it collectively, individually, and as a community. Ms. Tippett: And it\u2019s just \u2014 what you\u2019re saying, when you talk about the need to find happiness and balance and centering and grounding, I mean again, those are the age-old, ancient, essential human challenges. Ms. boyd: Nothing\u2019s changed on that one. Ms. Tippett: What? What? Ms. boyd: Nothing has changed on that front. Ms. Tippett: Nothing has changed, but I think you\u2019re saying \u2014 so in one way, technology, even by making some of that stuff harder, is actually forcing us to need to negotiate and have conversations and be intentional about these things in a way that we didn\u2019t have to be intentional before. Ms. boyd: Yeah, and I mean I think that it\u2019s a tool. It\u2019s a vice for some. It\u2019s a way of connecting. There\u2019s all of these different layers to it. And we\u2019ve had to think about how to be responsible in relationship to anything. If you think about it in terms of ancient religious texts, you think about gluttony, think about what is our relationship to food. We agree that food is a necessity, but what\u2019s the level in which it\u2019s acceptable? And I think that the danger is that we just assume that it\u2019s more like alcohol, which is that it\u2019s always bad, that you\u2019re always on the edge of having a very unhealthy relationship with it. Or maybe I should say a harder drug. And I would say that\u2019s not necessarily the metaphor we should be working with here. Like all of these other stimuli, though, we should step back and say, hey, what is the relationship I want to have with people, with food, with substances, with the internet, with my environment? And that\u2019s where I do think that there\u2019s a spiritual ask to all of this. danah boyd is principal researcher at Microsoft Research and the founder of the Data & Society research institute.
