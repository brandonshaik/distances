  "fullText": "My guest this hour is physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne. He explains how he applies the deepest insights of quantum physics to religious mysteries \u2014 and finds new ways to think about prayer, evil, evolution, and the afterlife. John Polkinghorne\u2019s perspective largely transcends popularized arguments that set scientific reason and religion at odds. He\u2019s written, \u201CBoth science and religion are needed to interpret and understand the rich, varied, and surprising way the world actually is.\u201D From American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, on Being, \u201CQuarks and Creation.\u201D For 25 years John Polkinghorne distinguished himself in the field of elementary particle physics as a professor at Cambridge. In 1974, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society, the scientific academy to which Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Stephen Hawking have also all been admitted. Then, at the age of 49, John Polkinghorne became a student again, this time of theology. My life changed in all sorts of ways at that transition point, but not in relation to the search for truth, both as a scientist and as a theologian. That\u2019s the absolutely controlling factor. \u201CIs it true?\u201D is the vital question. John Polkinghorne eventually returned to Cambridge to think and teach at the interface between science and theology. In Great Britain, he\u2019s chaired government initiatives to consider ethical issues raised by science. In 1997, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. Though, as tradition dictates, Polkinghorne does not take the honorific title \u201CSir\u201D because, as an ordained minister, he would not be expected to wield a sword. I sat down with John Polkinghorne in 2005. It\u2019s striking right from the outset that his vocabulary about God and science tends to notions such as beauty, subtlety, and surprise. If working in science teaches you anything, it is that the physical world is surprising. And I was a quantum physicist, and the quantum world is totally different from the world of every day. It\u2019s cloudy, it\u2019s fitful, you don\u2019t know where things are, if you know what they\u2019re doing. If you know what they\u2019re doing, you don\u2019t know where they are. So that it\u2019s a complex world and quite different from what we expected. But it\u2019s an exciting world because it turns out we can understand it, and when we do understand it, we have a deep intellectual satisfaction. Now, if the physical world surprises us and is different from everyday expectation \u2014 common sense, if you like \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be very odd, really, would it be, if God also turned out to be rather surprising. Things that are just on the surface, easy to believe, are not the whole story. There\u2019s a deeper, stranger, and more satisfying story to be found, both in science and in religion. I think I\u2019d like to ask you about a few other words that you use, concepts where I think you bring together both theology and religion and flesh them out for me. And another one is beauty? Well, beauty is a very interesting thing, and a form of beauty that is important to me is mathematical beauty. That\u2019s a rather austere form of aesthetic pleasure, but those of us who work in that area and speak that language can recognize it and agree about it. And we\u2019ve found in theoretical physics that the fundamental laws of nature are always mathematically beautiful. In fact, if you\u2019ve got some ugly equations, almost certainly you haven\u2019t got it right and you should think again. So beauty is the key to unlocking the secrets of the physical world. What are the qualities and properties \u2014 how do you describe what\u2019s beautiful about a mathematical equation? Well, it\u2019s very hard, of course, to describe any form of beauty. Of beauty, right. In some sense you have to perceive it. And it\u2019s more difficult with mathematics, because you have to be able to speak the language. It\u2019s a bit like saying, \u201CThis is a wonderful Icelandic poem,\u201D but if I don\u2019t understand Icelandic, I won\u2019t get the gist of it. So mathematical beauty is connected, first of all, with things being elegant and economic. You don\u2019t write a great sprawling equation that takes half a page to write down. It\u2019s very concise, just perhaps a line with only a few symbols in it. But it turns out that it\u2019s also very deep, so that when you explore its consequences, you find this very simple-looking thing. It implies this, it implies that, all sorts of surprising and unexpected things. And if it\u2019s a successful part of mathematical physics, of course, it will imply all sorts of phenomena happening in the world. And that\u2019s what we mean by mathematical beauty. It\u2019s very hard in everyday language to get a closer description of that. What is striking, I think, is that those of us who happen to speak that sort of language can agree about mathematical beauty. OK. But, in fact, I suspect we agree rather more readily about mathematical beauty than, say, painters do about artistic beauty. You also talked about how, in the same way that we take seriously the insights of science, we need to listen to the words of poets and to the insights of saints and mystics, and to hearing that also in that context. Absolutely. Yes. I think reality is very rich, many-layered, and science, in a sense, explores only one layer of the world. It treats the world as an object, something you can put to the test, pull apart and find out what it\u2019s made of. And, of course, that\u2019s a very interesting thing to do, and you learn some important things that way. But we know that there are whole realms of human experience where, first of all, testing has to give way to trusting. That\u2019s true in human relationships. If I\u2019m always setting little traps to see if you\u2019re my friend, I\u2019ll destroy the possibility of friendship between us. And also where we have to treat things in their wholeness, in their totality. I mean, a beautiful painting, a chemist could take that beautiful painting, could analyze every scrap of paint on the canvas, tell you what its chemical composition was, would, incidentally, destroy the painting by doing that, but would have missed the point of the painting, because that\u2019s something you can only encounter in its totality. So we need complementary ways of looking at the world. Bits and pieces, for sure, that\u2019s a worthwhile thing to do, but not the whole story. I mean, I\u2019m thinking even when you talk about moving from testing to trusting, I mean, scientists do that, too. Right? I mean, quarks have become an explanation, but isn\u2019t that something that scientists also take on faith, in a sense? Well, quarks are, in some sense, unseen realities. Nobody has ever isolated a single quark in the lab. So we believe in them, not because we\u2019ve \u2014 even with sophisticated instruments, so to speak \u2014 seen them, but because assuming that they\u2019re there makes sense of great swaths of physical experience. And I was lucky enough to be a humble member of the particle physics community during the time all that was being worked out, and it was great fun to be, in a small way, part of it. You know, I should ask you to explain quarks. Yeah, well, when I began, many years ago, as a research student, a graduate student working in science, we thought that matter, nuclear matter, was made up of protons and neutrons. And then, as we experimented and as we began to find out more and more about what was going on, it became more and more difficult to understand things in those terms, and it gradually dawned on people, it dawned on some very clever people, that maybe the protons and neutrons themselves were made up of something yet smaller, yet more basic, and they would have some quite surprising properties. For example, they would have fractional electric charge, which nobody has ever seen directly. And then people began to see that, though they couldn\u2019t see these entities on their own, the way matter behaved, both the way it was organized, the patterns of structure that it had, the way projectiles bounced off target particles, all that made sense if these unseen quarks were sitting there inside, never capable of being knocked out, but nevertheless real. So, in this indirect way, the unseen reality of quarks became an absolutely fundamental aspect of our understanding of the structure of matter. And that remains the case. And I, in common with all particle physicists, believe very fervently, in a way, in the reality of quarks. But it\u2019s an unseen reality. It\u2019s the fact that they give intelligibility to the world that makes us believe that they\u2019re actually there. It\u2019s such a fanciful word, quarks. How did that get named? Well, one of the people who made a great deal of the running in these discoveries was an American theoretical physicist called Murray Gell-Mann, who is also a polymath sort of person; he\u2019s very interested in language. And he had read James Joyce\u2019s Finnegan\u2019s Wake, and there\u2019s a line in there which says, \u201CThree quarks for Master Mark!\u201D And these quarks come in threes, and so Murray picked that up and made this his \u2026 It\u2019s a literary word. It\u2019s a learned literary joke, I think. I love that. OK. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, on Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, faith, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CQuarks and Creation.\u201D My guest is physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne. He proposes that recent scientific advances make new room for religious insights and questions. Twentieth-century physics, he says, revealed that contradictory explanations of reality can simultaneously be true. For example, the scientific puzzle of whether light is a particle or a wave was resolved with the explanation that light has a dual nature as both a particle and a wave. That was clarified with the help of one of the founding fathers of quantum physics and one of John Polkinghorne\u2019s teachers at Cambridge, Paul Dirac. There\u2019s something you wrote that I thought made sense in terms of this idea that we\u2019re \u2014 you and I are sort of dancing around that you can be a scientist and a religious person \u2026 Right. \u2026 and take seriously the insights of both and not necessarily find them to be in opposition. You talked about how wave and particle theories can both be true. And you talk about how Paul Dirac in 1920 at Cambridge suddenly made it clear how light could give a wave-like answer if you asked a wave-like question or a particle-like answer if you asked a particle-like question. Can you explain what he\u2019s describing and what that means to you? Well, it\u2019s a very striking example of how surprising the physical world is. People had been arguing about what light was like for a long time. Newton had some ideas about it. In the 19th century, people made some discoveries, both experimental and theoretical, that clearly showed that light behaves like waves. There are certain properties of waves, which showed up in an absolutely unquestionable way, and so the answer seemed to be settled. But right at the beginning of the 20th century, through the ideas of Max Planck and also a young chap, who was an examiner in a patent office in Berne, called Albert Einstein, people saw that what light also had, particle-like properties, and that was a real crisis, because, you see, a wave is a spread-out, flappy thing, and a particle is a little bullet. So how could something be sometimes spread out and sometimes bullet-like? And for about 25 years nobody knew. But the scientists just had to hold on to experience by the skin of their teeth even if they didn\u2019t quite know how to reconcile it. And then the thing has a happy ending, I\u2019m glad to say, back in my old University of Cambridge where Paul Dirac discovered something called quantum field theory. Now, a field is something that is spread out, and so it can be flappy. So it certainly has wave-like properties. But when you bring in quantum theory, it makes things come in packets. That\u2019s the effect of quantum theory, it chops things up into little packets. And little packets look like little particles, and so a quantum field has both these sorts of properties. And if you ask it a wave-like question, it gives you a wave-like answer. You ask it a particle-like question, it gives you a particle-like answer. And you can\u2019t ask both questions at the same time, which saves you from having, you know, a contradiction. OK. But you take both answers into account. You take both answers into account. And the important thing I want to emphasize is that people had to cling on to taking both insights into account before they understood how they fitted together. We don\u2019t make progress by chopping experience down to a size that fits into our current theories. We have to allow the way the world is to modify our understanding of the world. And, if you\u2019re a Christian theologian, and you\u2019re telling that sort of story that I\u2019ve just told about light being both particle-like and wave-like, we know that the Christian story about Jesus Christ is that he is, of course, a human being but also, in some real sense, needs to be described in terms of divine language. And it\u2019s the same sort of dilemma, if you like, and we\u2019re not quite so clever, theologically, at finding the precise answer to that. But, again, we don\u2019t make progress by denying our experience. Right. I mean, I was going to say that model, that paradigm that you said, that you don\u2019t explain things and come to more wisdom by squeezing things into a theory, maybe scientists are more open to that kind of way of moving through the world than religious traditions sometimes have been. They may be. Actually, I mean, scientists don\u2019t find it easy to change their views either. I mean, people sometimes say scientists question everything all the time. I mean, of course they don\u2019t. We would make no progress if we did. If you were an eternal skeptic, you\u2019d never get anything done. So it\u2019s painful and difficult. But there are times scientists do allow experience to mold their thinking. And, perhaps more slowly, I think religious people do, too, but it\u2019s not quite so quick. So one of the ways religious people dealt with science for a long time \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about the last couple of centuries \u2014 was what we\u2019ve now called the \u201CGod of the gaps\u201D idea. Describe your understanding of how that worked to me. I mean, I think people in the science/religion dialogue refer to that a lot, but I don\u2019t think lay people out there have a memory of that. Well, when science first came into being in the 17th century and then in the 18th century became very successful through the discoveries of Newton and the aftermath of all those, then some people began to say, \u201CWell, OK, science can explain the solar system, it can explain everything.\u201D And the religious people tried to fight back by saying, \u201CNo, science can\u2019t explain everything, and there are gaps in our knowledge, which only God can fill.\u201D And, for example, the human eye is a very complicated, a very beautiful optical system. How could that have come about other than being made, so to speak, directly by God? Well, of course, then Charles Darwin came along in the 19th century and showed how the eye could have evolved piece by piece, slowly and slowly, and so on, and drew the rug from beneath that argument. And then people could see with hindsight that the God of the gaps type argument, the God who\u2019s stepped in to do the things that science couldn\u2019t currently explain was in itself a theological mistake. If there is a God who is the God who is the Creator of the world, that God is the God of the whole show, not the sort of cosmic stunt artist who does the difficult things, the obscure bits, and leaves nature, so to speak, to do the rest. It\u2019s back to this fundamental mistake of feeling that if nature does it, we don\u2019t need God. God is the God who ordains nature. God works through nature as much as through anything else. And, in these days, in the science and religion community, the most contemptuous criticism you can make of somebody is to say, \u201CI think your argument is a God of the gaps type of argument.\u201D Then he says, \u201CNo, no, no, I\u2019m not trying to do that.\u201D So we\u2019ve learned something. We\u2019ve learned something, and I think we\u2019ve learned something that is theologically helpful. There\u2019s a passage in Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s Letters and Papers from Prison where he says \u2014 where he\u2019s reflecting on that in the mid-20th century and says if God is consigned to the unknowable, we\u2019re learning more and more, so God is always being pushed further and further back out of human experience. That\u2019s right. Yes, I mean, the God of the gaps was a sort of Cheshire Cat deity, fading away with the advancement of knowledge. Fading away, getting smaller and smaller. But actually, I mean, again we\u2019re back to this question of truth. I mean, if God is the god of truth, then the more truth we have, the greater understanding we have, the more, actually, we are learning about God. Physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne. In his book Quarks, Chaos and Christianity, he writes this: \u201CWe can take with absolute seriousness all that science can tell us and still believe that there is room left over for our action in the world and for God\u2019s action, too.\u201D Polkinghorne continues, \u201COf course, this does not mean that prayer is just filling in a series of blank cheques given us by Heavenly Father Christmas. Prayer is not magic. It is something much more personal, for it is an interaction between humanity and God.\u201D And, of course, there are all sorts of different forms of prayer. I mean, there\u2019s sort of worshipful prayer. And I think a lot of scientists actually pray in that way without knowing that they\u2019re doing it, because one of the rewards for what is actually a laborious business doing scientific research is a sense of wonder when you see the beautiful structure of the world or the way things work. And I think, though scientists don\u2019t use the word wonder when they write formal papers for learned journals, they use it quite a lot in their conversation. And it is, as I say, the payoff for all the labor. And I think that actually is a form of worship, whether the scientists know it or not. But I suppose the crunch question is can a scientist ask God to do something? A petitionary prayer in that sense. Knowing what you know about the laws of nature and, in fact, as you\u2019re saying, respecting that it works and how it works. Well, that\u2019s right. Well, if the world were clockwork, then I suppose you\u2019d have to hope that God had designed the clockwork and wound it up in such a way that things wouldn\u2019t turn out too badly. But 20th-century science has seen the death of a merely mechanical and merely clockwork view of the world. It came first of all through quantum theory. At the subatomic level, quantum events are not precise and determinate. They have a certain randomness to them. They have a certain cloudiness to them, so that that process isn\u2019t clockwork. And we\u2019ve learned, of course, from chaos theory, the \u201Cbutterfly effect\u201D \u2014 very small disturbances producing enormously big consequences \u2014 that even the everyday world described by the sort of physics that would have been familiar to Newton isn\u2019t as clockwork as people thought it was. So the world is certainly not merely mechanical. And I think, actually, we always knew that because we have always known that we are not mechanisms. We are not automata. We have the power to choose, to act in the world. It\u2019s a limited power. We can\u2019t fly, but we have the power of agency. And if we can act in the world, then I think there\u2019s no reason to think that God can\u2019t act in the world as well. So I think that 20th-century science has loosened up our view of the physical world. It\u2019s no longer a piece of gigantic cosmic clockwork. It\u2019s a world in which we can conceive ourselves as the inhabitants and acting in it and helping to bring about the future. And I believe also in God. So my answer will be that scientists can pray. Not, of course, as magic, but as cooperating with God, if you like, to bring about the best for the future. So \u2014 I told you this before we began to speak \u2014 I think it was about 15 years ago I first heard your voice on the BBC late one Saturday night. I was not a scientist asking that question, but I was a person who had been completely political asking that question. And you, in five minutes, gave me a way to think about that, make it such an interesting question, because you were talking about, again, your idea of how you understand how the world works and that, for you, all that we\u2019ve learned in science \u2014 and I want you to correct me if I\u2019m not saying this right \u2014 suggests to you \u2014 again, this is to repeat what you just said \u2014 that there are things that function in their essence and move forward all the time, like we breathe or like the grass grows. But there are also these places of randomness and little openings in reality, and you also imagined that that is relevant to the idea of prayer. Yes. Yes. I think that the picture we now have of the physical world \u2014 I mean, the old 18th-century picture was a clockwork world. And there are, certainly, clocks in the world. The sun is going to rise tomorrow. We can tell you the exact minute at which it\u2019s going to rise. But we\u2019ve also learned that there are lots of clouds in the world. That\u2019s to say a processes whose outcome is not clear and certain and is not clear beforehand what\u2019s exactly going to happen, so it\u2019s a sort of mixture of the two. And that means that that has a consequence for prayer. There are some things that it isn\u2019t sensible to pray for. An early Christian thinker called Origen, who lived in Alexandria, which is jolly hot in the summer, said you shouldn\u2019t pray for the cool of spring in the heat of summer. The seasons are going to be there. And of course, theologically, we think that the regularity of the seasons reflects, if you like, the faithfulness of the Creator. But there are other aspects of the world which are cloudy, and I think those are the areas where there is, so to speak, room for maneuver. And I think it\u2019s through exploiting that room for maneuver that we act in the world and that God also acts in the world. So there are other things that we can pray for. I mean, the weather, for example, is certainly not just clockwork. And so, though it might cause a bit of a shiver to run down some people\u2019s spines, I think we can pray for rain if we\u2019re afflicted by a drought. Well, give me another example, though. I mean, rain is one, but I mean, what would be another example of thinking about openings for human action? Well, I think most of life, actually, is cloudy, and in these cloudy areas, things can, so to speak, go either way. I think recovery from illness. I mean, of course, there are clearly illnesses that are mortal illnesses. There is a clockwork side to illness, if you like. But we also know that illness is very much affected, prior to recovery, very much affected by people\u2019s personality and so on. And I think that there we can pray that somebody may be strengthened or encouraged or given hope, and that may very well lead to a form of healing that might not have been possible without that. So there is this quite extensive area where we can\u2019t exactly \u2014 the point is, if God acts through these cloudy processes and we act through these cloudy processes, we can\u2019t take them apart and say, \u201COK, I can see that God did that bit,\u201D because we just can\u2019t itemize them. And so we can\u2019t perceive it directly, but, by faith, we may have the intuition that God is indeed working in that sort of way. I mean, there is going to be an ambiguity in interpreting these things. So this is kind of about ambiguity and variables that we may not be able to perceive at any given moment. That\u2019s right. But life is like that. And we can\u2019t have it sort of cut and dry. And that enables us to be what we are. There\u2019s a very interesting scientific insight which says that regions where real novelty occurs, where really new things happen that you haven\u2019t seen before, are always regions which are at the edge of chaos. They are regions where cloudiness and clearness, order and disorder, interlace each other. If you\u2019re too much on the orderly side of that borderline, everything is so rigid that nothing really new happens. You just get rearrangements. If you\u2019re too far on the haphazard side, nothing persists, everything just falls apart. It\u2019s these ambiguous areas, where order and disorder interlace, where really new things happen, where the action is, if you like. And I think that reflects itself both in the development of life and in many, many human decisions. I spoke with John Polkinghorne in our studios at American Public Media. That was in 2005.

Also, how science helps him ponder the possibility of the afterlife and the nature of the human soul. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, on Being, \u201CQuarks and Creation.\u201D My guest, John Polkinghorne, is a particle physicist who in midlife also became a theologian and Anglican priest. We\u2019re exploring how his understanding of quantum physics and chaos theory flows into his thinking about religious mysteries \u2014 from his image of God, to prayer, the afterlife, and evolution. John Polkinghorne does not understand creation as God\u2019s one-time production of a ready-made world. Instead, he understands creation itself as a continuous, ongoing process. I wondered how John Polkinghorne thinks about the intelligent design movement that\u2019s arisen in recent years in response to the theory of evolution. I think that the intelligent design people ask some interesting questions. They look at the molecular level of life. They look at things like the blood clotting process or they look at the little things that make entities swim around, the cilia that are sort of oars that make them go around. And they say, \u201CThese are quite complicated systems even at this molecular level.\u201D And they have several component parts to them, and we can\u2019t see how they would work unless you had all those parts in place. And so they say, \u201CHow could that have come about in an evolving way, bit by bit, piece by piece?\u201D In fact, that\u2019s how evolution seems to work. It seems to be, again, a sort of unfolding process, bringing forth, if you like. So I think the intelligent design people ask some quite interesting questions, and the questions are, in principle, scientifically answerable, but I don\u2019t think we yet know the answers. So I\u2019m very cautious about the line of argument they\u2019re trying to make. I think you also bring your theology and your science together interestingly in seeing that there\u2019s also something going on in the world, and including human beings\u2019 interaction with nature at any given time, that there are sort of competing freedoms. I think that\u2019s a very interesting, complex idea. Yeah. Well, I think we live in a world of true becoming. That\u2019s to say, I don\u2019t think that the future is fixed; I don\u2019t think God fixed it. I think God allows creatures to be themselves. Does God know it? If we live in a world of true becoming so that we play our little parts in making the future \u2014 and I believe God\u2019s providence also plays a part in making the future, and also the laws of nature that God has ordained play a part in constraining the form of the future \u2014 if that\u2019s the sort of world in which we live, then I think actually even God doesn\u2019t know the future. And that\u2019s not an imperfection, because the future is not yet there to be known. Now, that\u2019s a very controversial view, and not everybody, by any matter of means \u2026 We\u2019ll let you have it here. \u2026 has agreed with me about that, but that\u2019s how it seems to me. And I think that, you see, there\u2019s been a very important development in theological thinking in the 20th century, and it\u2019s reflected in all sorts of quite different theologians, but they have this thing in common: They see that the act of creation, the act of bringing into being a world in which creatures are allowed to be themselves, to make themselves, is an act of love and it is an act of divine self-limitation. The theologians like to call it kenosis from the Greek word, and so that God is not the puppet master of the universe, pulling every string. God has taken, if you like, a risk. Creation is more like an improvisation than the performance of a fixed score that God wrote in eternity. And that sort of world of becoming involves God\u2019s accepting limitations, and I believe, accepting limitations not knowing the future. That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that God will be caught out by the future in the same way that you and I are. I mean, God can see how history is moving, so to speak, but God has to react to the way history moves. Now, that makes, to me, quite a lot of sense about the world. Well, and really that\u2019s a kind of theological way of describing evolution, in a sense, this becoming this creation that creates itself. Yes. Absolutely. Yes, and in fact, I mean, people \u2014 you know, Darwin published The Origin of Species in 1859, and people think that was a great parting of the ways between science and religion, a big clash; all the scientists shouting, \u201CYes, yes, yes,\u201D all the obscure religious people \u2014 the clergy, of course \u2014 shouted, \u201CNo, no, no,\u201D and they just went their separate ways. Quite untrue. The scientist has \u2014 a lot of scientists had doubts about Darwin, actually, for a while. And some religious people \u2014 from the start, an English clergyman called Charles Kingsley said that God could no doubt have snapped the divine fingers and brought into being a ready-made world, that God had done something cleverer than that: God had made a world in which creatures could make themselves. And so that\u2019s the picture that God brings into being a universe, it has great potentialities, great possible fruitfulness, but creatures are allowed to explore and bring that fruitfulness to birth. And that seems to me a very beautiful and fitting form of creation, a better world, so to speak, than a world which was ready-made. But it has a necessary cost. It has a shadow side. Yes. Right. That\u2019s what I wanted to ask you, the question, if all these terrible things happen, what does that say about the nature of God? Absolutely. I mean, the greatest difficulty of religious belief, obviously, is the way the world is. It is beautiful and it\u2019s fruitful, but it\u2019s also ugly and terrifying, and dreadful things happen in the world. And the problem of evil and suffering is a very great problem. Now, this scientific insight helps us a little bit with that. If creatures are going to make themselves, to explore this potentiality, there will be blind alleys and ragged edges in that exploration. That\u2019s bound to happen. And, I mean, a very simple example is this: What the engine that has driven the three-and-a-half-billion-year history of life on Earth has, of course, been genetic mutation. I mean, for two billion years or so there were only bacteria. Then things complexified, because genes mutated and new possibilities came along. So that\u2019s been a tremendous fruitfulness. But, if that\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s inevitable that other cells will mutate and will become malignant. You can\u2019t have one without the other. So, though the fact there is cancer in the world is obviously an anguishing fact about the world, it\u2019s not, so to speak, gratuitous. It\u2019s not something that a God who is a bit more competent or a bit more compassionate could easily have eliminated. It\u2019s the shadow side of a world allowed to make itself. What does that way of looking at the world say about something like a tsunami? Well, if God allows creatures to be, God will allow tectonic plates to be. So creatures, not just human beings, but every aspect of nature? When I say creatures, I\u2019m thinking of the whole created order, different parts of it. For example, we believe that having tectonic plates is an important necessity for a planet that\u2019s going to have life because, between the plates, new material wells up from inside and replenishes, so to speak, the surface of the earth. But, of course, if there are going to be tectonic plates, not only will that happen, but sometimes they will slip. And when they slip, that will create an earthquake or, if it\u2019s under the sea, will create a tsunami. I mean, again, it\u2019s a hard answer. I mean, it\u2019s not a \u2026 It\u2019s not a compassionate answer. Well, it\u2019s not a \u2014 I think it has an element of compassion in it, but it\u2019s not a sentimental answer. Right. That\u2019s for sure. I mean, a great Oxford theologian said \u2014 there was this tremendous earthquake in Lisbon in 17 \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 55, and it killed 50,000 people in one day. And he said, \u201CWell, it was God\u2019s will.\u201D I think the hard answer was that the elements of the earth clashed and behaved in accordance of their nature. They are allowed to be just as you and I are allowed to be. It\u2019s not an easy answer, but I think, actually, it is the true answer. Well that \u2014 that I mean, this is something I\u2019ve come to understand through your work, this idea that free will is built in and that it\u2019s a gift, essentially, that human beings experience it as a gift. We\u2019re not robots. But earthquakes will be earthquakes, or tectonic plates also have their essence of being. Right? That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s right. They have their essence of being. And that is respected. And that these freedoms \u2014 and this is the essential nature that\u2019s given to every aspect of creation \u2014 can collide and cause effects which will be devastating for one side or the other. Yes, I think that\u2019s right. I think that God does respect the integrity of creation. God is not a sort of magician or an interferer. I\u2019m sure God interacts with the history of the world, but not in a way that overrules it. I believe that God wills neither the act of a murderer nor the incidence of an earthquake, but allows both to happen in a world which is a creation given a degree of independence by its Creator. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, on Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CQuarks and Creation.\u201D My guest is physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne. I asked him: If the possibility of suffering is built into the creation as he understands it, what does that say about the nature of God? Doesn\u2019t it take us right back to the age-old question of theodicy? That is the question: How could a good God have made a world in which there is so much innocent suffering? I think I\u2019d want to say three things. First of all, I mean, the sort of argument we\u2019ve been having at the moment is an intellectual argument. And I think it\u2019s mildly helpful, but it doesn\u2019t, of course, answer all the problems. I mean, the problems with evil and suffering are deep existential problems. \u201CWhy is this happening to me?\u201D or \u201CWhy is this happening to somebody I love?\u201D And those are entirely legitimate questions to ask. There\u2019s a particular Christian insight that seems very, very important to me, indeed, in some sense, enables the possibility of Christian belief, and that is that the Christian God is not simply a compassionate spectator, invulnerable up in heaven, looking down on this strange and suffering world, but has also been a fellow sufferer, a fellow participant in the agony of creation. The cross of Christ, understood from the point of view of Christian theology, is God living a human life and nailed to the cross in the darkness and in the paradox of the dereliction \u2014 \u201CMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201D \u2014 of Calvary. So God knows human suffering and the suffering of creation from the inside and not simply from the outside. And also, I don\u2019t want to play a sort of pie-in-the-sky type of answer to things, but I do believe that this life is not the only life we live. I do believe we have a destiny beyond death. And though that doesn\u2019t explain away the suffering of this world, I think they would be even more bitter, really, if there were no such destiny to look forward to. And that\u2019s an article of faith, really. Well, it\u2019s an article. Of course, as a Christian, I believe that it\u2019s an article of faith that has been exemplified and guaranteed within history by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but it\u2019s not something with which we have direct experience. You know, there\u2019s a very deep human intuition of hope. Peter Berger makes this very beautifully in a little book of his called A Rumor of Angels. He takes everyday things and says, \u201CThink about them for a minute. Where are they pointing you? They\u2019re deeper than you think.\u201D And one of the things he says is a child wakes up in the middle of the night, scared by a dream or something like that, a parent goes to the child and says, \u201CIt\u2019s all right.\u201D And Berger says, \u201CNow, what\u2019s going on there? Is that a loving lie? Because, obviously, cancer, concentration camps, the world is not exactly just all right.\u201D Yeah, lots of perils. Yeah. But nevertheless, he says that is a deep human intuition, and the assurance that that\u2019s so is an important part of enabling that child to grow up into full humanity. So there is a deep-seated human intuition of hope, the strangeness and bitterness of the world notwithstanding. And I do take that very seriously. You take that seriously? Yes, I do. As part of the evidence we have of the truth we\u2019re trying to get at? Well, I think Berger calls these things \u201Csignals of transcendence,\u201D hints that take us beyond the everyday level of things. And I take it seriously at that level, yes. This is a simple question, but when I was learning about evolution and \u2014 well, when I was, say, a teenager \u2014 now, obviously, the texts of Genesis 1 and 2 where religious people look to talk about creation or, as you say, they were not written as scientific textbooks. But it still seems to me that if you \u2014 the only real leap that you have to make for, at least the Genesis 1 story of \u201CIn the beginning,\u201D and the sort of progression of life forms \u2014 the only leap you have to make for that really not to contradict with what we know from science is to say God\u2019s days are longer than our days, that there\u2019s a sense of time. I mean \u2026 Well, not quite. OK. I mean, this is an extraordinary thing, Genesis 1. It\u2019s the more sophisticated of the two stories, of course, and things don\u2019t quite come in the right order. I mean, it\u2019s striking that it begins with energy for light, \u201CLet there be light.\u201D It\u2019s striking that life starts in the waters and moves onto the land. But of course \u2026 When those would be true, essentially more or less what we\u2019ve discovered. Yeah. But the sun and moon and stars only come on the fourth day. And of course, there wouldn\u2019t be any life without the stars, because that\u2019s where they make the raw material for life. So that isn\u2019t right. And we believe that one of the reasons, we believe in theology, one of the reasons why the sun, moon and stars come downstream, so to speak, is that the writer is wanting to say the sun and the moon aren\u2019t deities. They\u2019re not to be worshipped. Because that was the conflict of his day. They are creatures just like everything else. And that shows us that what we\u2019re reading is a theologically oriented thing and not a scientifically oriented thing. I mean, you have to figure out, when you read something and you want to read it respectfully, you have to figure out what it is you\u2019re reading. Is it poetry or is it prose? If you read poetry and think it\u2019s prose, you will make the most astonishing mistakes. And Genesis 1 is a poem, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. It\u2019s much more like a poem than like prose. And that\u2019s, in a sense, the sadness of the \u201Ccreationist\u201D so-called position, that these people who are really wanting to be respectful to scripture are, I think, ironically, being disrespectful, because they\u2019re not using it in the right way. All right. Well, so you won\u2019t say that the only leap is to say God\u2019s days are longer. But let me ask you this, if it takes 14 billion years to get to where we got now, by your understanding of the best of science that\u2019s out there, what is that long amount of time, that patience? How does that inform your understanding of the nature of God? Well, certainly God is not a god in a hurry. That\u2019s clear. God is patient and subtle. God works through process and not through magic; not through snapping the divine fingers. And I think that\u2019s what we learn from seeing the history of creation as science has revealed it, and I think that tells us something about how God acts generally. And, when you think about it, if God really is a God whose nature is best described as being the God of love, then that is how love will work. Not by overwhelming force, but by, if you like, persuasive process. So I think we learn something really quite valuable from that. Again, it\u2019s an example of how religious insights about the nature of God and the scientific insights about the process of the world seem to me actually to be very consonant with each other. You can\u2019t deduce one from the other, but you can see it and they fit together in a way that makes sense. They don\u2019t seem to be at odds with each other, and I find that encouraging. Another interesting and hard question, at least on the surface, is if tectonic plates, which will always eventually create earthquakes and tsunamis, act according to their nature, how does that reflect on the idea that there is also some kind of moral nature of the universe? Well, I think that \u2014 I don\u2019t think that moral principles apply directly to tectonic plates. I mean, they apply to people who are moral agents. You could ask the question that, therefore, if there are questions about \u2014 moral questions, they\u2019re about the morality of God \u2026 Right. Is God moral if God created tectonic plates? Yeah. Well, there, I think that, back towards something I said before, that if God is going to bring into being a world in which creatures are allowed to make themselves, and God does that, because that is a greater good than a ready-made world or a magic world in which fire never burns anyone when they put their hands into it, and so on, when deeds, in fact, never have consequences, if that\u2019s a better world, then even God, you see, can\u2019t create that world without it having its shadow side. I mean, it\u2019s very important to understand what we mean when we say God\u2019s almighty. We mean by that not that God can do absolutely anything, but God can do what God wills in accordance with God\u2019s nature. I mean, the good God can\u2019t do evil deeds, the rational God can\u2019t decree that two plus two equals five. And if God is going to bring into being a world in which creatures make themselves and God judges that to be a world of greater good than a ready-made world, then even God cannot make that world a world in which there isn\u2019t a costly side to things. Are there any cutting-edge developments in your field of particle physics or in the world of science that really challenge your faith or that pose questions that you\u2019re holding in tension? Well, I\u2019ve never, in my exploration of these things, felt I reached a sort of crisis situation in which I was faced with an either/or choice. I mean, either go with science or go with religion. There are, of course, puzzles all the time. And one of the things that\u2019s happening in the science-and-religion world, to some extent, in the last few years, it has been that people are getting interested in questions of what the theologians call eschatology. Which is the end of things. In other words, trying to make sense of the notion of a destiny beyond death. And then you raise questions of what\u2019s the human soul? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a detachable, spiritual bit, so to speak, I think it\u2019s the real me. The real me is certainly not just a matter of my body, because that\u2019s changing all the time. Through wear and tear, eating and drinking, the atoms change. But, in some sense, the pattern in which the atoms are formed, that I think, is what the soul is. And this is what Thomas Aquinas, the great theologian in the Middle Ages, would have thought it was, too. And that would be the pattern of your personality and your effect. Well, it\u2019s an immensely rich pattern. I mean, beyond our paths, right, it doesn\u2019t finish at my skin. It obviously involves my memories, my character, my personality. It also, I think, involves all the relationships that help constitute me. Right, it takes on substance in the course of your life. Exactly. And it\u2019s very complex, and obviously we\u2019re struggling to even say something about it. But that\u2019s what it is, I think, and I think God will not allow that pattern to be lost and God will re-create that pattern in an act of resurrection. These are the sort of things that people are exploring at the moment. And I think that\u2019s a \u2014 what\u2019s happening, I think, is that the science and theology conversation is getting more theological. Theology is being allowed to set more of the questions. I mean, for a long time, and quite rightly for a long time, science set the questions. \u201CHere\u2019s Big Bang cosmology. Here\u2019s biological evolution. What do you make of that?\u201D And theology would seek to respond, and I think it\u2019s been able to respond pretty well. But now theology\u2019s asking some of the questions and saying, you know, \u201CWhat\u2019s the human person?\u201D \u201CWhat could be the carrier of continuity between life in this world and the world to come?\u201D And I think that\u2019s a healthy development. You want the conversation to be very even-handed in that respect.
