  "fullText": "Amy Ray and Emily Saliers have been making music as the folk rock duo Indigo Girls for over 25 years. They have a new album out, One Lost Day. Seven of their 16 albums have gone gold, and they\u2019ve been nominated for seven Grammys. They\u2019re known for their social activism on-stage and off, but long before they became the Indigo Girls, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers were singing in church choirs. Amy was raised in a conservative Christian family. Emily is the daughter of a well-known Methodist pastor and church musician. In 2006, she co-wrote a book with her father, A Song to Sing, A Life to Live: Reflections on Music as a Spiritual Practice. These days, Amy and Emily see music and spiritual life intertwined in a way that can\u2019t be pinned down. Music is physical. It\u2019s got your heartbeat, it\u2019s got rhythms, it\u2019s got space. It\u2019s a physiological reality along with a mystical reality. So it\u2019s metaphysical. There\u2019s not many things to in life you can point to and go, that\u2019s metaphysical. But music is. It\u2019s funny, because you can find God in music when you\u2019re gathered together singing a song, but also there are moments that I\u2019ve had seeing people perform where it\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019s God. It\u2019s like, they\u2019re not God, but God\u2019s there. It\u2019s like Patti Smith at Red Rocks, Prince\u2019s Purple Rain tour. There\u2019s just these moments and it\u2019s not the personality of the musicians anymore. Something\u2019s disappeared and the music and the audience and everything has merged and there\u2019s no separation between performer and audience. That is what spirituality is supposed to be. The Indigo Girls on God and music, in church and in smoky bars. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with Amy Ray and Emily Saliers on an outdoor stage at the 2013 Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina. Just as we were about to start, a torrential rain began, but the hundreds of people gathered stayed put, got soaked, and waited for the clouds to pass. So after a biblical rain, the faithful are still gathered. It\u2019s kind of amazing. And here we are at a festival named after a Celtic Christian metaphor for the unpredictable spirit of God. We have 45 minutes and we\u2019re going to just dive right in. So this festival brings together \u2014 it takes place at the convergence of music and spirituality and justice and the arts, and it seems to me that that convergence has been there for each of you for a long time. And I thought \u2014 I always ask this question at the beginning of my interviews, whoever I\u2019m interviewing, quantum physicists or a musician, about the spiritual background of their childhood. But I think \u2014 so I want to ask that question, but also as you reflect on that, I kind of sense for each of you that music was always in there, and maybe even justice and the arts in that way. I\u2019ll start. Well, my dad is a Methodist minister and a theologian and he taught at Emory and Candler School of Theology. So, yeah. Yay, Dad. I know your dad, too. He\u2019s in Germany doing something theological over there. Yeah. You were raised in the bosom of church music. Yeah, totally were. Me and my sisters. There were four girls growing up and we went to church and we sang in the church choirs. But we were also \u2014 I think both my parents, both my dad and my mom, fostered an open environment of discussion and questioning and stuff. So we would go to church and then we\u2019d come home and ask a lot of questions \u2014 usually to Dad. So we had a lot of theological discussion as very, very, very young girls. And then we had music always in the house. We sang in the church choirs, but also Mom and Dad had a big LP collection. So we grew up, like, on Saturday mornings, having jazz and classical music in the house and listening to symphonic stuff and church music and all that stuff. So really was \u2014 our whole upbringing was saturated in music and theological discussion. And you also spent some time at Saint John\u2019s Abbey. Is that right? When you were a teenager? Dad had a sabbatical. I was 14 and we spent a year there in Collegeville, Minnesota. Yeah. And did you take in some of that chant, some of that singing of the psalms? It gave me an appreciation for the power of quiet in spiritual practice, which I think a lot of young folks \u2014 or maybe I\u2019ll just speak for myself \u2014 didn\u2019t really understand. Well, what\u2019s the big idea about being a monk and going and being quiet? What does that do for the world? And it gave me a very, very keen understanding of exactly what it does for the world and for spiritual communities. And then it was just exotic. It was Minnesota, it was cold as hell. And we were at an Ecumenical community and I\u2019ve always been \u2014 I like Ecumenical environments, \u2018cause we never had Christianity shoved down our throats. In fact, my Dad had so many Jewish colleagues, and we had just a real Judeo-Christian upbringing as much as a purely Christian upbringing. So any time I\u2019m in an Ecumenical setting, I feel most at home, if I\u2019m gonna be in an organized faith setting of any kind. That\u2019s the best one for me. OK. So, Amy, what about you? Well, it was a little bit different from Emily, I think, in that it was a more conservative upbringing. Many of my relatives were Methodist ministers, and my aunt married an Episcopalian minister, priest. And so I grew up with religion all around me, and we spent Sunday mornings, Sunday nights, Wednesday nights, and Friday night youth group. So I spent a lot of time at church, and went to church camp for about five years when I was becoming a teenager. And there was music all around. We were supposed to learn piano when we were young and we sang hymns as a family and campfire songs, \u201CKumbaya,\u201D and all that stuff, for real. \u201CThey\u2019ll Know We Are Christians By Our Love.\u201D I probably know a lot of them still, actually. And I was really into church, actually. I had a great youth minister, and I found it to be a place where I could challenge \u2014 I mean, my church was very conservative, but my youth group wasn\u2019t. And so it was a place of a lot of challenging questions all the time, and I learned a lot when we went on retreats, and you get in trouble, and you just feel \u2014 you\u2019re always kind of pushing your boundaries, and it\u2019s a safe place to do it, I guess. But I went on to be a religion major in college, and I thought for one moment that I might actually go to seminary and explore that path. But music was a bigger draw, and I couldn\u2019t pick one, to be honest with you. You couldn\u2019t pick between \u2026 Between Christianity and Judaism and Buddhism \u2026 Oh, you couldn\u2019t pick a religion. I thought you maybe couldn\u2019t pick between music and religion. They\u2019re all great and I really felt that way. But I was raised in a strongly Christian environment. So I probably relate the most to that culturally. But music was just more of a tug and I felt like it was just what I was compelled to do. I was raised Southern Baptist, which I\u2019ve mentioned a few times this week, in Oklahoma. And it strikes me that a lot of our churches didn\u2019t really know what to do with our bodies in general, and a lot of the language was \u2014 bodies were entry points for danger. But our traditions really know about the power of music, right? And when I think of \u2014 there\u2019s so many memories that I have, and people I talk to, all kinds of people. And I remember reading in the book that you wrote with your father \u2014 music that goes all the way through your body. It\u2019s in your cells. It\u2019s like you said. You still know those songs today. I\u2019m just throwing that out there. What was the question? I\u2019m kidding. Inspiring me to think out\u2026 I like thinking out loud. \u2026think in real time, yeah. Thinking out loud is good. It\u2019s interesting about that fear of the body, yeah. I mean, I think it just goes back to control, especially controlling women. That\u2019s where I think all that fear of the body comes from. And the truth is that men have been controlling women for a long time, especially when they get organized. Do you feel that there was a controlling aspect to church music, too? Well, I was going to say, like, my dad worked on sort of the newer Methodist hymnal, and there\u2019s a hymn in there with Duke Ellington, \u201CCome Sunday.\u201D And we grew up in a very staid \u2014 all the hymns were \u2014 you could sort of picture white people sitting straight up. And I have nothing against white people, but for me, always, it was gospel music that like \u2014 especially African-American gospel music \u2014 that really was the direct conduit to me in the spirit that I felt moved my life and my actions. And it involved movement of the body. It was sensual because, I don\u2019t know, I sort of feel like, generally speaking, when people get all in their heads, it blocks the spirit, because spirit is not mental. It\u2019s spirit. Yeah. And the body takes you out of your head and connects you. So once I heard African-American gospel music and was blown away \u2014 and the first time I heard it, I was scared. Because a woman had a spiritual, ecstatic experience, although she was crying and jumping up and down, and I was terrified. But that was the body and real life pain experience connected to spirituality, and music brought her to that place. And I\u2019ll never forget that day, and then I\u2019ll never forget my own journey of appreciating getting out of the head and getting into the body. And so those are just some of my musings on that. When I think about the music that I was learning in youth group or spiritual songs, it was interesting because I actually went through a couple of years of being really conservative and going to see Christian rock bands that were not radical left Christian rock bands. They were talking about pro-life, and \u2014 and then I would hear a song that was a pro-life song, and I would be like, \u201COh, I\u2019m pro-life,\u201D because I was a folk singer and it seemed so right and hippie-like to be all about love like that. It was so powerful and I think that just taught me that music is powerful either way, and that you still have to hang onto yourself in that moment, and know where your spirit is, because it can really influence you. Because it takes you \u2014 it does take you out of your context to a certain degree. But I think I needed to go through it, and I needed to find my own self within all the different things being thrown at me. How do you think about the line now for you between sacred and secular music? Is there a line in music or in life? There is a bit of a line for me, because I\u2019ll write songs that are \u2014 I\u2019ll write gospel songs that are more like Appalachian mountain gospel songs. And that\u2019s a sacred song to me, and spiritual in a different way than maybe an unrequited love song might be, or a story song about my family or something. It\u2019s coming through me. I don\u2019t try to edit it too much. I don\u2019t try to make it more complicated than it needs to be and it\u2019s just reserved for singing and not commercial anything. You know what I mean? I mean, I can put them on records, but it doesn\u2019t feel the same to me somehow. I mean, not to say that all the music\u2019s not spiritual, but there is definitely for me a place that I go into if I write a little gospel song. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, better known as the Indigo Girls. I spoke with them at the Wild Goose Festival. This is a gathering of a loose movement sometimes called the \u201Cemerging church\u201D \u2014 reimagining the face and voice of Christianity in an evolving world. I think that music is a spiritual gift, and then you \u2014 artists or writers use it how they see fit. So for me, like \u2014 I used to draw more of a line between what\u2019s sacred and what\u2019s secular. Amy actually helped me with this coming \u2014 an evolution of recognizing how sacred what is deemed secular is. But I love a lot of rap music, and \u2014 it\u2019s not just rap music, it could be hair bands from the \u201870s or \u201880s or whatever. I have a deep objection to misogyny in lyrics and in musical posturing. So I can love a genre, but if I hear a song that has that content, I can\u2019t separate it from the music. And I don\u2019t think that any kind of music that is used to objectify or hurt any person or group of people, type of person, is a sacred practice. So I guess I draw the line there. I forgot you all were there. I\u2019ve also read you saying \u2014 talking about finding more of what you wanted in church sometimes in a smoky bar than you found in churches, which is a little bit different way to talk about sacred/secular. Well, that\u2019s why we spend so much time in smoky bars, I think. I think with the book that I wrote with my dad, we talk a lot about that, because he cut his teeth on jazz, which is deemed secular, but it really informed his musicality, which then he got the calling to faith. Then he focused on church music and hymnals and things like that. But when we played in like Little Five Points Pub in Atlanta, it was a motley crew of people from all walks of life, and we used to join each other on stage, and we\u2019d just have this sort of \u2014 most of us were dysfunctional in some way or another, but it was very honest and we \u2026 Aren\u2019t we all dysfunctional in some way or another? Yeah, for real. But in church sometimes, people pretend that they\u2019re not, or the message is we\u2019re not, or they\u2019re too afraid. It\u2019s real hard to get real sometimes in church, the real pain, the real stuff, you know? And a lot of times it\u2019s focused on the life to come rather than the life that\u2019s right here and what we can do. But in those days, when we were playing in bars, I mean \u2014 and my dad and I talked about this a lot \u2014 that is a spiritual experience. And I know the word \u201Cspiritual\u201D gets used a lot, and maybe we don\u2019t even know exactly what it means anymore, or I don\u2019t. But it was a feeling that people who were very different from each other were all welcome together, very little judgment going on, as I recall, just a hootenanny of people\u2019s bolstering each other\u2019s spirits through music. And that\u2019s, if that\u2019s not spiritual, I don\u2019t know what is. When you said a minute ago that Amy helped you see \u2014 helped you think differently about that relationship \u2014 can you say some more about that? Amy\u2019s always just been like \u2014 I think I had ideas in my head about what was what, this is this, and this isn\u2019t this. Amy opened my \u2014 she was more alternative than I was, you know? She liked music that was more alternative, she liked music that was more raw. I think she had an understanding of real pain than I did. She was just more evolved about all that stuff and just kind of was who she was. And I learned a lot from her about that. I honestly did and I still do. But specifically about the power of \u2014 OK, I\u2019ll give you an example. Because we were classically trained, and we listened to a lot of classical music and jazz and stuff like that, I had an early snobbery about\u2026 Amy\u2019s nodding in agreement. \u2026what\u2019s the best-quality music or whatever, and Amy\u2019s like, \u201CThree chords is closer to God.\u201D She didn\u2019t say that, but \u2014 and now I feel that way more than I do the other way, you know? So it was Amy who really helped me with that and I appreciate that. I didn\u2019t have an appreciation for simpler things that were profound as much as I do now. I don\u2019t usually ask people this question head-on, but I feel like you guys can handle it, which is \u2026 Now you really want to know what I\u2019m gonna say, don\u2019t you? Do you think of yourself as religious now? I mean, I\u2019m very spiritual. I guess in some ways I\u2019m religious too. It\u2019s so much the fabric of my life. It\u2019s so much the way I think. And I think I took what I think are good things from the church, and the gospel, and applied them to my life in a way that has worked for me. And I like having that. For me, it\u2019s a cultural construct that works really well, you know? Mm-hmm. I know there\u2019s so many of them, but I know the one that works for me. But I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t go to church a lot. I go sometimes. I really actually wish I went more, to be honest with you, \u2018cause I really enjoy it. But I get so carried away. I love church. Any kind. Any kind of church. You do? Yeah. I just love \u2014 it\u2019s interesting to me the spatial relationships between things, what people say, what kind of hymns they sing. It\u2019s all interesting. Like I \u2014 it\u2019s not just intellectual. I mean, it\u2019s spiritually interesting. I find it to be all valuable in this really weird way, and I actually feel less judgmental when I\u2019m in there, even if people hate me and are radically different from me. OK, that\u2019s really interesting. I have this feeling of openness that lets the hate just go off, and I just feel love in the building. It\u2019s weird, because I really like nature more, but I\u2019m just \u2014 I think it\u2019s from being a religion major or something. I\u2019m just really attracted to it in this weird way. So I do consider myself religious. I do. I saw someplace, I think it\u2019s a video you did, you called yourself a \u201Cqueer for Jesus.\u201D \u201CThat\u2019s what I am. I\u2019m a queer for Jesus.\u201D Yeah, that\u2019s about right. Yeah, I want, like, the queer Easter Bunny as the mascot for that, I think. Queer fertility. It\u2019s awesome. How about you? Do you think about yourself as religious? When I think about the word \u201Creligious,\u201D it has a negative connotation to me, because I think about it as organized, and then I don\u2019t feel part of that. For me, whatever \u2014 and I feel like the language is always limiting. Yeah, and I think that\u2019s kind of what I want to get at, because I think the language is limiting for everyone. So I like to ask people to break it open and say what it means or doesn\u2019t mean for them. Well, for me, I\u2019ll go beyond the word of \u201Creligion,\u201D because I do think of that in terms of organized. I think of that in terms of abusive power, like a bureaucracy, all that bad stuff that is happening in the church today. So many avenues that really block you from getting to the source, which is what I want to get to for my own journey. I think that I have such a deep connection to the music that I grew up with in church \u2014 the hymns, the sound of the organ \u2014 and also because we weren\u2019t raised in really any kind of church that made us feel bad. It was kind of thoughtful. The sermon was related to the readings and it was all \u2014 and there was a season that was based on the Jewish calendar that was recognized as based on the Jewish calendar, which I always appreciated. And so I like \u2014 and with my Dad and the people that I grew up with, the theologians \u2014 they thoughtfully organized liturgy. They put thought into constructing it so that people might get the most out of it. So I appreciate that like writing a good paper or something, I guess. If you construct it with care, it\u2019s bound to be more effective to the reader or the receiver. So I grew up with that. I like that part of thought and organization and structure in religion. But for me, I have to say that no matter what it\u2019s called \u2014 and I\u2019ll call it God \u2014 but to me, it\u2019s a great benevolent spirit that\u2019s much wiser than any of us, my belief, that is involved in the formation of things, the change of things, the evolution of things, is my whole \u2014 my life is in that spirit\u2019s hands. That\u2019s what I believe. So it\u2019s not \u2014 it ain\u2019t me running things. But that\u2019s when language and imagery gets in the way. I don\u2019t believe in a puppet-master God or any of that stuff. So I can\u2019t even describe it. It\u2019s loving, it\u2019s powerful, it\u2019s wise, it\u2019s kind. It\u2019s not a mother or a father. It\u2019s just this thing that I trust, because this thing has shown me time and time again its wisdom. I have my feeble human perception of what wisdom is, but I\u2019m gonna go with that. And I was thinking about what you said about language and stuff being such an obstacle, and what Emily said. It\u2019s so funny because I feel like, in some ways, I wasn\u2019t exposed to religion in that way. I was exposed \u2014 like my great-uncle was a Methodist minister, and part of his sermon was to do magic tricks. It was a very different exposure, and I loved that and it actually was good for me to see that. And I think as queer people we also have this built-in translator sometimes. And I can sit and listen to most sermons \u2014 not all of them, but a lot of them \u2014 and inside, I\u2019m changing the language in my head as I\u2019m going. I don\u2019t even notice it. And I\u2019m getting something out of it. And I\u2019m not sitting there going, \u201CIt\u2019s a patriarchy, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it,\u201D you know? Because I\u2019m just so used to, from such a small age, having to do that to feel OK about myself, to be honest with you. And the same goes for music. We grew up with rock and roll being a white guy\u2019s thing, and sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and it was really romantic, and we had to change all the lyrics in our heads, and the imagery, and believe that it was OK to be a woman and play music. When I\u2019m in a graceful moment, I don\u2019t even think about it. I don\u2019t let anything block me, because I have this gift that you\u2019re given, I think, from the time you\u2019re young, sometimes, to just translate it as it comes in and make it for you, you know? I mean, we don\u2019t all have it. We can\u2019t always do it. I mean, I think we all have it, but we can\u2019t always do it is what I mean to say. And it\u2019s not necessarily a great thing. Maybe it would be better to be exposed to this incredible intellectual, spiritual sermon that felt so accepting of who I was as a woman and a gay woman at a very early age. \u2018Cause I know that when I would go to a different church, or have a visiting preacher that would say something \u2014 like quote Dostoevsky or something, I\u2019d be like, \u201COh my God, this is so amazing,\u201D because it would be something different. And really I was just totally turned on by that. But what I was really used to was the other thing, which is, like, take what you can get from it, and that\u2019s what you get. And I think it\u2019s got its own blessing in there somewhere. You can listen again and share this show with the Indigo Girls at onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation about music and God with Amy Ray and Emily Saliers \u2014 the musical duo the Indigo Girls. I spoke with them outdoors at the Wild Goose Festival in Hot Springs, North Carolina. The two of you started \u2014 got to know each other, you started playing music together when you were still in high school. And also, as I read it, still before either of you had come out as lesbian to yourselves, much less to anyone else. And then I think you were two of the first real celebrities to be very open about your sexual orientation. And when I started to prepare to interview you, there are 100,000 articles online about you telling the story of how you came out to your parents, right? That\u2019s all people care about. I don\u2019t want to ask you that story. I want to ask you how you start to see that trajectory of your lives, and how important that was when you were teenagers, in this big picture of how the world is shifting now, where we are now in 2013. Do you think about that? You start. Oh, no. So you mean in the context of queer rights \u2026 Well, I guess, one thing I mean is \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe not five years from now, but 20 years from now, that might not even be a story that would be a big deal. Yeah, wouldn\u2019t that be great? You know what I mean? Yeah. I think that\u2019s coming at some point. It\u2019s like Star Trek, you know? It\u2019s the next generation, for sure. Or Voyager. I mean, it\u2019s hard to envision it, honestly, because there\u2019s still so many areas and places where young people coming out, it\u2019s so hard still. There are so many people against you. There are some areas \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s better than it was. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But I try not to look too far in the future, because I feel like it\u2019s better to look at what\u2019s happening right now, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, honestly. But I hope there\u2019s a time. I know when we were in high school, it was the suburban South in Georgia. We really didn\u2019t even know what \u201Cgay\u201D meant. We knew that it was a joke you made about your coach, honestly. That\u2019s all we knew. That was it. And then we \u2014 I fell in love my senior year with a girl, and I didn\u2019t even know what to call it. I was open about it, because I was like, this is great! So I think we\u2019ve come a long way, and there\u2019s the conversation. It\u2019s on TV, it\u2019s in popular culture, we\u2019re talking about it in our churches one way or the other, whether it\u2019s bad or good, we\u2019re talking about it, you know? And that\u2019s the first step. And hopefully we\u2019ll just take it a day at a time and just try to \u2014 it\u2019s all about neighbors, you know? It\u2019s about neighbors. About what? Neighbors. It\u2019s one-on-one. It\u2019s changing lives one-on-one. I live in a rural town in north Georgia. It\u2019s pretty conservative. It\u2019s very conservative. And the only way things change \u2026 You live there still now? Yeah. I\u2019ve lived there for 20 years. And the only way things change is when you get to know the person sitting next to you at the diner or at the meeting or wherever you are. And you may be really different from each other and you just \u2014 you make friends, and you help each other out, and that\u2019s where the walls come down. I just find it to be something that has to be a very one-on-one thing. I mean, I think, obviously we\u2019re in the movement, and we want to change things like that. But it\u2019s really changing in tiny, little patches across the country and we still need to be focusing on that, I think. Little high schools and little meetings, PFLAG, and all that great stuff. That\u2019s very important still. And so I think I see my life when I was in high school, and not even knowing the language around it, and now there\u2019s all this language and we can talk about gender, which is \u2026 Yeah. And there\u2019s the web, the internet, which is \u2014 the interweb, which is awesome, you know? \u2018Cause then somebody who can\u2019t be exposed to that language gets exposed to it. There was something you wrote \u2014 I think you helped write this. It was the cover to one of your albums that maybe you did on your own. \u201CIn the mid 1970s, Amy Ray was a Georgia tween plucking out Partridge Family songs on her guitar and dreaming of becoming David Cassidy, the ardent teen idol who got all the girls.\u201D Yeah. Actually, I didn\u2019t write that. You didn\u2019t write it? My ex-girlfriend wrote that. I mean, ex, ex. That\u2019s even better. Yeah. She\u2019s a writer. She thought it was very clever. I didn\u2019t have time to change it. But I did love David Cassidy. Now it\u2019s on public radio. Forever. I love him, I\u2019ll say it. I was just gonna make a comment about the queer rights, and where we are now. Change is hard, and I feel like, since the beginning of human history until the end of time, we\u2019re probably still all gonna have to be working on accepting those who are different from us, you know? It starts out as an evolutionary protection device. You have to be wary of that which is different just to make sure you\u2019re safe in your environment. But we screwed it up, you know? And I was just thinking yesterday, my \u2014 I\u2019m getting married next week. Yay. Thanks. We\u2019re getting married. My partner\u2019s Canadian. We\u2019re getting married by a justice of the peace because we\u2019re afraid they\u2019re gonna repeal the laws before we get a chance to \u2014 so we\u2019re gonna hurry up and get married, and then we\u2019re gonna have a ceremony. So queer people they have to \u2014 you can\u2019t do it the way you dream about it really, you know? We had the kid first, and then \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter how straight people do it. It\u2019s fine, but we haven\u2019t had the same privileges of chronology. So anyway, we\u2019re gonna get married, and then we\u2019re gonna file that paperwork the next day, and then she\u2019ll get her green card if everything goes as we hope, and there you go. But she was so \u2014 yesterday she called Delta, \u2018cause we were booking some flights, and she referred to me as her wife to the agent. My whole body got tense. Here\u2019s what I thought: this agent hates her, this agent is not gonna help her, this agent is immediately judging her, this agent, blah, blah, blah. And I was just \u2014 that is what is in me, you know? As much as I\u2019ve been an activist and as much as I\u2019ve been queer my whole adult life. I was just like, wow, the change has to come from within. It really does, and it takes a long time. Even from within you. Yeah. But I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve allowed myself to be damaged by other people\u2019s judgments of me, and it\u2019s hard not to when you talk about the church, too. Holy cow. \u201CYou\u2019re going to hell,\u201D and all that. God bless the Pope, who at least came out and said, \u201CI can\u2019t judge gay people.\u201D I mean, that\u2019s changed. I\u2019m so excited about being a wife, really. I like that word, \u201Cwife,\u201D personally. But my whole body tensed up, and I\u2019m like, you know. It was a bad feeling. Yeah. How did the agent react? Totally fine. \u201CLet me check that for you. One moment, please.\u201D You know? \u201CYes, I can seat you two together.\u201D And then, little by little, you realize that not everybody hates you. Well, I mean, I\u2019m exaggerating. I know that, but you know what I mean. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, on an outdoor stage with the Indigo Girls \u2014 Amy Ray and Emily Saliers. So you two definitely are in this lineage of music and social justice, social healing, social activism. I mean, we\u2019ve been talking about this piece, about this sexuality piece where there\u2019s a lot of change that\u2019s unfolding right now in real time. But I want to ask you about how you think about social change in our time, with \u2014 I\u2019ve been talking to some people here who\u2019ve been involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and social change doesn\u2019t look like that now. It\u2019s not clear that you can have the leaders and the critical mass the way it worked 50 years ago. But on the other hand, we have technology. I\u2019m just kind of curious about how you see that, this time we live in, and how change happens, and how music can be part of that. Huge question. It\u2019s a great question. Great question, Krista. We should ask her how she thinks about it. How do you think about it? No. There\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s against the rules. Oh, sorry. It was Amy\u2019s idea. We have rules here too. It\u2019s like church. Well, you know more than we do about it. I mean, I think it\u2019s an excellent, excellent thing to think about and talk about. I can\u2019t really wrap my mind around technology. I do know that I trust the media far less than I used to. There\u2019s so much information out there, and it takes a lot of energy to be vigilant. And how do you even know where information is sourced from, and all those things? So back in the days \u2014 let\u2019s use the \u201860s and the anti-war movement, for example. I mean, it was easier, in a way, to consolidate a spirit and a movement. We were less distracted. We had less options, less avenues, less choice. The world seemed a simpler place, although humans weren\u2019t any simpler. But the world seemed a simpler place because we weren\u2019t bombarded. But it brings to light \u2014 I mean, I think the tools are as powerful, but maybe not more powerful than they ever were. And you think about \u2014 and I think about how music \u2014 you know, Vincent Harding, who was here, who\u2019s a civil rights leader, talks about how civil rights activists \u2014 there was this aspect of singing the way to freedom as much as it was about politics and marching. Everything started and ended with singing, and singing was there all the way through. You figure, like, Pete Seeger in the \u201860s. So now you don\u2019t have that, but you do have technology that\u2019s so accessible, right? Your music is out there in ways that you could never have imagined it would be out there when you started singing together in high school. But it\u2019s out there. It\u2019s not the same, though, as a protest song that\u2019s not owned, but part of a movement, and so it\u2019s a different property. I don\u2019t know how to \u2014 there\u2019s so much about music that\u2019s become, I guess, secular, rather than sacred, in some ways, because I consider protest music sacred. Like when you read about Woody Guthrie \u2014 and I was talking to a friend out there about this \u2014 traveling around for one union, thing, event to another, and migrant workers, and all the things that were happening, and the music just being this thing that fueled all these stops. I think that still goes on to a certain degree, sometimes, but I think it\u2019s \u2014 we don\u2019t even write enough protest songs. We\u2019re still singing the same ones and they\u2019re great. But we don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. But you write activist music. Yeah, but it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s like, you go to an SOA protest, and you\u2019re like, what song should we sing? \u201CCloser to Fine.\u201D But there needs to be a \u201CWe Shall Overcome\u201D of our \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve been talking to \u2014 it\u2019s funny. This whole last year, I\u2019ve had a lot of these conversations with activist friends of mine from different groups that are working in the undocumented workers movement and racism movements. We all talk about that, too. We need to be writing songs, and telling our stories that are going on now. And I know there are people doing that, but they\u2019re not getting heard because there is so much. And so it\u2019s like, how do we elevate those people? And how do these songs get heard? And how do we make them into the songs of the movement? And I don\u2019t know. So you\u2019re all asking those questions. We\u2019re asking. We don\u2019t know the answers. I know you know this, but, I mean, people\u2019s lives have been changed also by your music. Somebody was just telling me \u2014 somebody here who\u2019s from England \u2014 about hearing you the first time in Royal Albert Hall 20 years ago. I think music can change people because it gathers us together, and it opens you up and when we all sing \u201CCloser To Fine\u201D together as a crowd, we\u2019re having \u2014 that right there is a revolutionary moment. The barriers are coming down, we\u2019re singing this song, and I agree with \u2014 I think that music is so powerful like that. But I also crave that \u2014 writing \u201CThis Land is Your Land,\u201D writing a Pete Seeger song, or a Woody Guthrie song. You know what I mean? I mean, I\u2019m not saying that \u2026 Yeah. No, I know. Or any of the great gospel songs that have been taken by the movements in the past and having those. And I have yet to understand where we\u2019re at, either. Because I think where we\u2019re at is as important as the Civil Rights Movement in the \u201860s. There is a cross-pollination of immigration reform movements, and queer movements, and poverty movements, and hunger movements. They\u2019re all coming together and they\u2019re helping each other out. It\u2019s remarkable. And I think that there\u2019s something remarkable going on. But how do we sing about it, is the question I have. So you all write some lyrics. Let\u2019s get some songs going. It\u2019s a great question to put into the world. I mean, I agree with everything that Amy said. You wrote a song, \u201CLet It Ring,\u201D that, to me, is as anthemic and powerful a protest song, and a movement song, as anything that\u2019s out there. \u201CLet justice ring\u201D is the gist of the song. But I sort of think of it as a queer anthem as well, but it\u2019s not just for queer people. It\u2019s for everybody, whoever was judged. So it\u2019s very, very powerful. Always gets a very strong reaction. You can\u2019t fake that, that visceral connection to what\u2019s really going on. That\u2019s when it doesn\u2019t go through your head first. Right. Goes straight to that thing \u2026 Your body. Yeah, exactly, yeah. And \u201CHammer and Nail.\u201D Oh. Bleh. Sorry, what? Oh, come on that\u2019s a total \u2014 one of Emily\u2019s songs \u201CHammer and Nail.\u201D That\u2019s\u2026 There\u2019s so many lines in that song I would change. Yeah, but it\u2019s a movement song. But the point of it \u2014 yeah, it is a movement song. It\u2019s a movement song. Yeah. I shouldn\u2019t have written it when I was that young. When did you write \u201CCloser to Fine\u201D? How old is that? Well, it came out in \u201889, but I probably wrote it in \u201887, \u201886 or \u20187. I\u2019m kind of amazed you could write that so young. When I read this I was getting ready to interview you and then I heard the song. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. And then I heard it was on the radio, and I heard it again, and now I\u2019m singing it constantly. I printed out just this verse. \u201CWe go to the Bible, we go through the workout, we read up on the revival, we stand up for the lookout. There\u2019s more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line, the less I seek my source for some definitive, the closer I am to fine.\u201D I feel like that\u2019s\u2026 You make it sound like poetry. \u2026That\u2019s what you learn as you get older. It is poetry. That\u2019s awesome. Thank you for that. That\u2019s cool. I just want to ask you if there is a song now or songs that really reflect how you\u2019re thinking now about what it means to be in the world? Well, most of mine are Amy\u2019s songs, like\u2026 Oh! I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019ll just say that they are, mostly. And there are lines in Amy\u2019s songs, like in \u201CShame on You,\u201D talking about immigration, and the line, \u201CI think we were on the same boat back in 1864.\u201D I love that line. Like, same as it ever was. And then Amy\u2019s got a song called \u201CSecond Time Around.\u201D It\u2019s just very much, like, don\u2019t compromise if it hurts inside, and have some pride, and if you don\u2019t have anything good to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. Just things like that that I want to live by. And there\u2019s another song I was just thinking of \u2026 \u201CPendulum Swinger.\u201D Yours. Yeah, I guess. I don\u2019t have the same reverence for my songs as I do for hers. You don\u2019t? Nope. Oh, you don\u2019t have them for yours, that you have for hers? Yeah. Sometimes I feel emotionally close to the song, but usually they\u2019re about personal relationships, and I\u2019ll think, \u201COh, that was a good image. I got that one.\u201D But it\u2019s not, \u201CThis really describes what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201D and that sort of thing, because \u2026 Yeah, but you\u2019re forgetting some of your songs, possibly. Like \u201CLet It Be Me,\u201D like \u201CPendulum Swinger.\u201D We talked about \u201CHammer and Nail.\u201D I know, but I don\u2019t hook into those songs the same way. Maybe there\u2019s another reason for it. It\u2019s easier to hook into the other person\u2019s song than to your own. That\u2019s just, like, the way it is. Really? Well, it just works out that way. Yeah, I guess so. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still together singing. The secret of a healthy, long relationship. Yeah, codependency. There\u2019s nothing like it. Oh, there\u2019s so much we could talk about. We have to finish, and we have to finish before the heavens pour again. Here\u2019s a really lofty question, but again, I feel like you\u2019re up to it. This is a quote from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in your book with your dad. He talked about religious music. I\u2019d never read all of that Heschel talking about religious music. \u201CReligious music is an attempt to convey that which is within our reach, but beyond our grasp.\u201D I just want to ask you how each of you think about how music and music over time has formed your sense of what it means to be human, and maybe even who God is, the image of God. I mean, I\u2019ll just say a couple thoughts that come to mind. One is that music is physical. It\u2019s got your heartbeat, it\u2019s got rhythms, it\u2019s got space, it\u2019s a physiological reality, along with a mystical reality. So it\u2019s metaphysical. There\u2019s not many things in life you can point to and go, that\u2019s metaphysical. But music is. It\u2019s just like, Amy was talking about protest songs, and how there have been protest songs that have bolstered the spirits, galvanized people in the midst of a very painful, but positive movement, social change movement. And so, it\u2019s such a powerful, powerful tool. So for me, it\u2019s been almost everything in the way I\u2019ve been shaped. But people write music, and what you get out of music comes from the people, and it comes from everything that\u2019s happened before it, and I love that too. I love that there\u2019s a continuum always and forevermore, and so that\u2019s how we can really sponge up the entirety of human existence, is through music, because it\u2019s come from that and, will continue to, so it\u2019s almost everything to me \u2014 shaped everything. Yeah, me too. I\u2019ll go with everything you said is absolutely true, the physiological thing, all that. It\u2019s funny, because you can find God in music when you\u2019re gathered together singing a song, but also there are moments that I\u2019ve had seeing people perform where it\u2019s just, that\u2019s God. They\u2019re not God, but God\u2019s there. It\u2019s like Patti Smith at Red Rocks, Prince\u2019s Purple Rain tour \u2026 Heart. It\u2019s like these certain moments that are \u2014 Rage Against the Machine at the masquerade in Atlanta. There\u2019s just these moments, and it\u2019s not the personality of the musicians anymore. Something\u2019s disappeared, and the music and the audience and everything has merged, and there\u2019s no separation between performer and audience. That is what spirituality is supposed to be. No separation. And so, for me, it\u2019s formed everything, because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always strived for, is that \u2014 not to be that performer, but to have those experiences at shows, you know? Go to a show and have that experience. It\u2019s sweaty and it\u2019s not beautiful. It\u2019s transcendent, though. Those are great last words. Thank you.
