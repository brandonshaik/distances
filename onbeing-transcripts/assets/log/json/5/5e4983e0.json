  "fullText": "O\u2019Connor believed that one breathed in the air of disbelief. I believe she said it was disbelief combined with attraction for the holy. They weren\u2019t content to settle in that place and say, \u2018This is my lot,\u2019 or \u2018This is the lot of our time.\u2019 Their hunger for something more, for something deeper was so strong that they made that unbelief or disbelief a starting point and then a continual testing ground for their religious convictions. Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Walker Percy. Paul Elie made a pilgrimage into the echoing lives of these 20th Century figures, and how they resonate in Catholicism and culture even now. Day was a bohemian writer who founded The Catholic Worker newspaper, as well as shelters and soup kitchens. Percy was a New Orleans physician who left medicine to write fiction. Merton was a pleasure-seeking sophisticate who became a Trappist monk and revered spiritual author. O\u2019Connor was an eccentric, deeply gifted Southern writer. Alone among them, Flannery O\u2019Connor was born Catholic. The other three converted as adults, embarking on a new life that they had first discovered in books. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Paul Elie is a senior fellow with Georgetown University\u2019s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs. He was previously a senior editor at the Farrar, Straus and Giroux, known commonly as FSG, the august publishing house with intimate connection to the writers who captured Paul Elie\u2019s own religious imagination. I interviewed him in 2005, a year after he published his book about them, The Life You Save May Be Your Own. I\u2019d like to start by hearing how you came to write this book. I think I wanted to be a writer ever since I was a teenager. Inspired by John McPhee and Tom Wolfe. Two writers that I then got a chance to work with as an editor at FSG. When I got to college I had relatively little knowledge of Catholic history. I\u2019d grown up in the suburbs in upstate New York in a modern church. Gone to public schools and gone through the whole catholic formation experience in a very present tense sort of way. Suddenly I get to the city and Catholic history and ethnicity is everywhere \u2014 the Irish, the Italians, the old churches, places where people go to become monks and so on and so forth. The history is very thick in New York, and I needed to understand that. It was natural to look to books. A professor recommended Flannery O\u2019Connor. I thought Flannery O\u2019Connor was a man, like Tennessee Williams, one of these colorful, double-barreled Southern names. Southern names, yes. Well, I got the complete stories with some money for Christmas my freshman year, I\u2019d gone to Fordham by the way, a Jesuit college in the Bronx. Started reading the introduction by Robert Giroux, and just the best introduction to a book, I think, that I\u2019ve still ever found. He just portrays her so vividly in a few words. And one of the ways that he does it is by comparing her to Thomas Merton and describing his visits when he edited both of their books to the South. He\u2019d go visit Merton, this renowned monk, at his monastery, and they\u2019d talk about Flannery O\u2019Connor. Then he\u2019d go to Georgia to visit Flannery O\u2019Connor, the celebrated young Southern writer, and they\u2019d talk about Thomas Merton. And he said that they had in common deep faith, great intelligence and a highly developed sense of comedy. So naturally, I wanted to know more about this Thomas Merton. And I bought The Seven Storey Mountain one summer day a couple of years later in the middle of an internship. What years are we talking here? This is the mid \u201880s. That was about 1985. Took the book home and was just knocked out by it, as so many people have been \u2014 the power of the narrative, the genuineness of his searching, but especially, and for the Catholic reader, the sense of strangeness and recognition. Here\u2019s this guy who comes from no belief at all who becomes a Catholic, and then the next thing you know, he\u2019s becoming a Trappist monk. And reading the book as a Catholic, you think, \u2018Is this really my religion?\u2019 It sounds just so wonderfully strange and powerful. I never realized there were such depths to this thing that I observed by going to church every Sunday. I was just knocked out by it and I tried to follow his path really for a year or so. I made a little space in the library that was a kind of monastic meditation space with books all around. The library at Fordham looked like a church and read my way through his stuff. After college, I was living in way uptown Manhattan. I read some Dorothy Day in an anthology put together by Robert Ellsberg. It was sold at the basement of Corpus Christi Church. Many people will know this church as the one where Merton was baptized up by Columbia University. Well, six weeks later came Lent, and I went down to the Catholic Worker on the Lower East Side to volunteer. Which is the community that Dorothy Day founded. Right. She founded it in 1933, and they had various headquarters. I went down there for a few weeks and helped out. And I didn\u2019t stick around beyond Lent, but it was very powerful to see people who had dedicated their lives or parts of their lives to helping the poor. And then Percy, I was already working at FSG as an editor, a literary publishing house in Manhattan, and the books are all over the place and you get to take them home and read them and mark them up if you want. So I read my way through his nonfiction. And then went to The Moviegoer, which I\u2019d tried reading once before. And this time it just made sense as the portrait of a man on the cusp of 30 trying to figure out what significance his life has and what he\u2019s supposed to do about it. Meanwhile these four, the references to them kept showing up in books. I\u2019d read about Percy and there\u2019d be a reference to Merton. I\u2019d read about O\u2019Connor and there would be a reference to Dorothy Day. So inadvertently they started emerging as a group and I started thinking about them that way. And one thing led to another and a couple of people suggested I should write about this very obvious passion I had for these writers. And I decided to take the leap. You know you make this statement, you tell these stories and you describe them, in a large sense, as a collective story of pilgrimage and a reflection on the meaning of pilgrimage, I think, in the 20th century and in our time. And here\u2019s a sentence, and it strikes me as interesting to me that this is your declarative, definitive thesis sentence before you launch into a much more complex definition of what pilgrimage means. You say: \u201CPilgrimage is a journey undertaken in the light of a story.\u201D I wonder if you could say something about how that conviction has developed in your mind and in your life and what you mean by that? Well, first of all, it\u2019s something that I needed to write the book to figure out. We entered the story in the middle. The story precedes us. It\u2019s the stories of our families, of our parents, the story of our region, the story of our religious tradition or the religious tradition to which we come on pilgrimage. We have certain expectations because of that story that we want to test with our lives and see if they stand up, to sound them and see if they\u2019re genuine. This, for example, helps to explain to me why so many people in the United States move from one religious tradition to another. We somehow don\u2019t consider it authentic just to carry on the story that has preceded us. We need to encounter a story for ourselves, and that\u2019s what happens many times when a person converts from one religion to another. Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting, and that is also something that I would say Walker Percy and Flannery O\u2019Connor and Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day \u2014 I mean, only one of them was born Catholic, Flannery O\u2019Connor. The others were converts as adults. And their pilgrimages were really pilgrimages of adulthood. But before we talk about them, and I do want to get to talking about them specifically, I want to ask you to tell some of the story of their time is different from our time. Perhaps, maybe I\u2019m wrong, maybe you\u2019ll correct me on this. But the incredible convergence of literature and religion sort of in the mid 20th century. You know, these were people who became deeply religious, you might even say obsessively religious, and something they had in common was that they read Dickens and Joyce and Pasternak and Eliot and Augustine and Kierkegaard. Tell me the story of the times that formed them all in that particular way. Well, you\u2019re right to say that books were the medium for them. I think of them as people converted by books. In all four cases, it was through the written word and through literary books, especially, that they had their deepest encounter with Catholicism. Thomas Merton read about monasteries and read medieval philosophy and read Dante and thought this is the life for me. And became a monk in a very medieval abbey. Flannery O\u2019Connor had a breakthrough as a young writer of fiction when she realized the stories of the old testament threw a special light on the rural south where she was living. Walker Percy had tuberculosis in the middle 40\u2019s and basically read his way through existentialist fiction and philosophy. Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard and recognized himself in those stories and thought this is who I am. These books are explaining me to myself. And Dorothy Day read the 19th Century novels Dickens Tolstoy and thought there is a sense of the human race as one family in those books and the interdependence of people that she wanted for herself and sought and found it in the catholic religion. They had an incredible openness to the written word as a conduit for experience, let\u2019s say, inviting them to go further. Why in that time more than in this? What stands out about that age and these four people in particular, for me, and I\u2019m talking about the years before the war, around World War II and just after, was the incredibly high expectations for life that they had. Here was a country that had depression, two world wars, and for some reason, people knew what was at stake in a human life. Dorothy Day said to herself, \u2018I have one life, and I\u2019m going to really live it to the fullest by trying to be a saint.\u2019 Let\u2019s put them in time. I mean, I think they all began publishing in the late \u201840s and early \u201850s, is that right? So really, as you say, coming out of World War II. Dorothy Day started the Catholic Worker in May of 1933. She was a generation older than the others. But her literary career really came together after the war and with the publication of her memoirs, The Long Loneliness, in 1952. Thomas Merton, The Seven Storey Mountain, his autobiography, was published when he was a young man in his middle 30s. In 1948, O\u2019Connor\u2019s first novel, Wise Blood, was published in 1952. Walker Percy\u2019s first essays were published in 1952 or 1953. I think something that strikes me, at the same time that they all really now have gone down in history as sort of emblematically religious, emblematically Catholic, in fact, they seem to all be looking for a configuration of place and companions where it would be possible to lead a holy life. And they all experience discomfort with where they were planted, and they all looked for the right context for that. I thought that was intriguing. I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s most pronounced in Thomas Merton\u2019s life. He, having gotten to the monastery of Gethsemani in Kentucky, which he thinks is really the perfect place on God\u2019s earth for him, he then proceeds to imagine other places that would be more perfect. And he does this, scarcely leaving the monastery for the next 20 years. The monks were not allowed to go out except to the doctor. He imagines monasteries in the Andes or on an Indian reservation or hermitages in France or in the hills of Italy or in the far West or in Alaska, again and again thinking, \u2018If I could only find this place that was ordered to my peace and solitude and experience of God, everything would be right.\u2019 And this is what, in his case, one of his mentors early on, the Thomistic philosopher Jacques Maritain identified as Augustinian restlessness. \u201CI am restless until I rest in you,\u201D Augustine said. Or I think he said, \u201CWe are restless until we rest in you.\u201D And this feeling of restlessness was the core of Merton\u2019s spirituality. But you\u2019re right to say it was very true for the others. And when I think\u2026 Dorothy Day. Yeah. Dorothy Day sort of immersed herself in humanity, but also, I remember, there was a line \u2014 was it Peter Maurin, her companion, her co-founder of Catholic Worker, who said that they needed to create a place where it will be easy to be good. Or easier to be good. Easier to be good. Which gives a good sense of the realism of the Catholic Worker. Just a little easier to be good. And this, as you say, they had an incredible sense of how society could be ordered a little differently than it was. And this connects to what I was saying earlier. Their expectations were so high that they weren\u2019t content to just rest in their alienation and sense of disappointment with life. They really \u2014 it sounds cliche to say they sought to do something about it, but they had an incredible imagination for the way in which, in their small fashion, they could make the world different and make it a place where it was a little easier to be good. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: author Paul Elie on the intersecting stories of Catholic figures Thomas Merton, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Walker Percy, and Dorothy Day. I need to ask you \u2014 because there may be people who listen who don\u2019t know Dorothy Day, I\u2019m sure there will be \u2014 I mean, tell the story of what she did, what she created, she and Peter Maurin, there. So Day, who was from New York, lived in California and Chicago, lived the bohemian life of artists in New York and Staten Island. And also lived as a radical, a member of radical political groups. But none of them spoke to her deepest instincts, which she said were religious. And she thought they talked more about solidarity and friendship with the poor than actually enacting it. The poor were in the Catholic Church at that time. She felt \u2014 she wanted, in the most physically way possible, to be joined to the poor, and the way for that to happen was for her to become a Catholic. I\u2019m not giving a full sense of the religious implication of this. She didn\u2019t just, you know, want to be among them for an hour a week, she wanted to be joined to them. So she became a Catholic around the time her daughter was baptized. But she still had all her radical instincts. And let\u2019s just remind that she had this daughter, this was a daughter who was born out of wedlock, right? That\u2019s right. And I\u2019m skipping the most interesting parts of the story, I guess. OK, all right. She was living with an anarchist, philosopher-type man named Forester, and because she\u2019d had an abortion in the teens and because of how it was performed, she thought that she would not be able to have another child. So when she became pregnant, she was joyful beyond measure. She was determined to have the child baptized. She didn\u2019t even quite understand this instinct, but she knew that it had to be so. Well, her husband \u2014 he was a common law husband, so I guess it\u2019s correct to say the child was born out of wedlock \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have anything of religion, so baptizing the child, that ended the marriage. Dorothy Day then took the natural next step, which was to become a Catholic herself. Then she looked around and the world is still broken, she\u2019s still eager as ever to fix things and make the world a better place. She\u2019s a talented journalist and organizer. What is she going to do with this very strong religious faith that makes her more than ever want to see justice in society? She\u2019s not sure. But one day, this man named Peter Maurin, recommended by a mutual friend, shows up on her doorstep and just starts talking this philosophy of communal Catholic life. They put their heads together, and a few months later they put out a newspaper, the Catholic Worker, May 1st, 1933. Then, in the way she describes in the excerpt, people just started hanging around the office and then wanting to sleep there and eat there. It was the middle of the Depression, and the Catholic Worker said to themselves, \u2018Well, we got to practice what we preach. So let\u2019s feed them and clothe them and shelter them,\u2019 and the rest is history. Of course, Dorothy Day is someone who, of these four, maybe Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton are more famous in our time. I\u2019m not sure that I had a memory \u2014 I know of her as this saint working with the poor. I didn\u2019t have such a memory of her as this wild bohemian who lived with several men, who had an abortion and then was a single mother. She left a lot of that out, and it\u2019s told very elliptically in The Long Loneliness. Yeah. She has an almost Victorian reticence. She does say, at one point, \u201CAbout the next few years, there\u2019s little to say.\u201D And that\u2019s when she was off being married and traveling around Europe with her husband and\u2026 Oh, right. I forgot about that marriage, yeah. That brief marriage. Well, she wasn\u2019t dishonest. It was \u2014 there\u2019s a head mistress sternness about her sometimes where she\u2019ll just insist, \u201CI\u2019m not going to go into this,\u201D and she doesn\u2019t. But we now know a good deal more about just how complex her bohemian life was. You identify with all of these people. I think in each of them, there\u2019s one sort of vital religious question or yearning around which their pilgrimage hinged. What would you say that is in Dorothy Day? Well, she\u2019s the person who could always imagine society better than it is. It stemmed from her experience in the San Francisco earthquake. She was an eight-year-old girl, she lived in Oakland. She stood on the street watching for the next few days as the people of Oakland helped each other and helped the people of San Francisco who were coming across the bay in boats. And for the rest of her life she just thought, \u2018People helped each other. Why can\u2019t we just keep doing that? Why can\u2019t society be organized so that we can help each other a little more so that that stranger who asks for food that I actually recognize that that person is a brother or sister to me in a way.\u2019 So she had a reformer\u2019s imagination of how the world might be other than it is. You know what\u2019s so interesting to me about that image of her standing before the San Francisco earthquake, seeing how people could love each other and help one another, you can dismiss that. You can say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s one of those extreme moments in life. We\u2019ve all see that. There\u2019s crisis and then it passes.\u2019 But then what she went on to do is to create communities of that same kind of crisis and intensity on a day-to-day basis with the poor. Well, that\u2019s right. And it\u2019s partly out of the recognition that it doesn\u2019t have to be merely the crisis moments that call forth that lovingness, and also the recognition that, at some moment, everyone is having a crisis of that magnitude. Yeah. That the crisis is among us all the time. Yeah, and that you have to be there when the person is having his or her crisis and not wait for the city to burn down. So here\u2019s this reading from the postscript. She says, \u201CWe were just sitting there talking when lines of people began to form saying, \u2018We need bread.\u2019 We could not say, \u2018Go, be thou filled.\u2019 If there were six small loaves and a few fishes, we had to divide them. There was always bread. We were just sitting there talking, and people moved in on us. Let those who can take it, take it. Some moved out and that made room for more. And somehow the walls expanded. We were just sitting there talking and someone said, \u2018Let\u2019s all go live on a farm.\u2019 It was as casual as all that, I often think. It just came about. It just happened. I found myself, a barren woman, the joyful mother of children. It is not easy always to be joyful, to keep in mind the duty of delight. The most significant thing about the Catholic Worker is poverty, some say. The most significant thing is community, others say. We are not alone any more. But the final word is love. We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community. It all happened while we sat there talking and it is still going on.\u201D Why did you send me that piece of hers? Well, it\u2019s one of the most powerfully written things that she did, and as the postscript to her autobiography, it\u2019s one that obviously she considered important and representative. But what it really gets at is something that I think you were pointing toward in all the remarks of the past few minutes. She thought it possible for society to be different than it is because she thought that we\u2019re naturally oriented toward love. We\u2019re made to love one another. That\u2019s natural. And strife and war are a deformity of that. But what we\u2019re created for is to love one another and to love one another in community. So she was trying to make clear in that passage that though she was a radical and a formidable organizer, it was not a programmatic effort that got the Catholic Worker going. It was people doing what came naturally, which was loving one another in community and talking about it. You can listen again and share this conversation with Paul Elie through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with writer Paul Elie. We\u2019re talking about modern Catholic identity, as explored in his creative 2004 work of biography, The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage. At Georgetown University\u2019s Berkley Center, he now leads the American Pilgrimage Project, examining the ways religious beliefs inform the experiences of the American people at crucial moments in their lives. The Life You Save May Be Your Own was the title of a short story by the 20th century Southern writer Flannery O\u2019Connor. Paul Elie juxtaposed her life and ideas with those of the Trappist monk Thomas Merton, the philosophical novelist Walker Percy and bohemian journalist and social organizer Dorothy Day. You know, there\u2019s something in the story of Dorothy Day, and in fact all these people you write about \u2014 Flannery O\u2019Connor, Walker Percy, Thomas Merton. There\u2019s a real fierceness and directness in the way they pursue faith and pursue God. It strikes me as very bold compared to the way I think that pursuit at least is articulated in our time. I think you\u2019re right that their fierceness is not typical in any time. But it certainly seems a better fit in their age than it does in ours. There were many, many associates of Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton who were pretty militant atheists, who thought that religion is the opiate of the people and could go on at great length saying that. It was one of their core convictions. So for Dorothy Day to go over to the other side, she had to be very definite about what she believed. Another thing \u2014 and I\u2019m loathe to reduce people\u2019s behavior to grand historical circumstances \u2014 but you had a depression and you had two World Wars. There was a certain clarity lent to Dorothy Day\u2019s experience or Thomas Merton\u2019s by the fact that they were deciding for religion \u2014 Day in the midst of Depression and Thomas Merton literally in the days before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. They were around and forced to make sense as relatively new Christians of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and to figure out what that meant for their age. They struggled with unbelief as much as they struggled with belief. Or they struggled against unbelief. And I wonder if that also created a special fierceness in the way they pursued faith. But, I mean, you know, here\u2019s Flannery O\u2019Connor writing, \u201CI don\u2019t know how the kind of faith required of a Christian living in the 20th century can be at all if it is not grounded on this experience that you are having right now of unbelief. This may be the case always and not just in the 20th century. Peter said, \u2018Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.\u2019 It is the most natural and most human and most agonizing prayer in the gospels, and I think it is the foundation prayer of faith.\u2019 But what strikes me also in the way Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O\u2019Connor, they all experienced faith to come at a cost, and unbelief something that they had to reckon with when they experienced within themselves. Again, you can look at it culturally or you can look at it personally. Culturally, O\u2019Connor believed that one breathed in the air of disbelief living in 20th century America. When you look back now, it seems like a relatively religious time if compared to our own or compared to the situation in Europe now, let\u2019s say. But she thought it was in the air we breathe, this disbelief. I believe she said it was disbelief combined with attraction for the holy is the characteristic of her time. And then personally, the three of them, leaving out O\u2019Connor, all came from places of unbelief or disbelief: Day, among the radicals who thought religion was an opiate; Merton, among radicals in Cambridge and at Columbia, but also, as a kind of teen-age nihilist who just thought the pursuit of pleasure was an end in itself; Walker Percy as a person prone to despair. His father and grandfather both committed suicide. His mother was killed in a car accident. His cousin, called Uncle Will, who raised him, was a person who was immensely cultivated, successful, admired and yet wasn\u2019t sure there was any point to it all. What strikes me again, when I mentioned earlier how high their expectations for life were, they weren\u2019t content to settle in that place and say, \u2018This is my lot\u2019 or \u2018This is the lot of our time. I\u2019ll just bear it.\u2019 Their hunger for something more, for something deeper was so strong that they made that unbelief or disbelief a starting point and then a continual testing ground for their religious convictions. You just mentioned Walker Percy and how much suicide and tragedy of that sort there was in his family. And it seemed to me that the animating religious question for him had to do with death. He also nearly died himself of tuberculosis. He was a pathologist studying dead bodies, basically, of tuberculosis patients, corpses that came in, sometimes washing up out of the East River. And instead of diagnosing the dead, in a way he thought, \u2018I\u2019d like to diagnose the living.\u2019 And when he himself was struck with tuberculosis, he lay down a doctor and got up a novelist, but remained all the while a diagnostician. The living individual human person would be his subject. What did he mean when he wrote, \u201CThere is a special kinship between the novel as an art form and Christianity as an ethos, Catholicism in particular\u201D? What he meant is that the novel, as a form, is distinguished from other forms in the broad sense like a play or an epic poem in that it deals with narrative events in the lives of ordinary people. There are exceptions to this, but in the main, if you looked at the history of the novel over 250 years, that would be true. With the novel, the ordinary person comes on stage. Well, theologically, the coming of Christ is the entry of God into the life of an ordinary person, that Jesus is just an ordinary man in 1st century Palestine, walking the earth like the rest of us, having problems, encountering opposition, dying a violent death. So in this sense, Christianity is seen as sanctifying and directing us to ordinary lives as a place where the divine is to be found. And so you can see the parallel between that and the novel, which looks for meaning in precisely the same place. Yeah, here\u2019s another sentence from this, what was this essay you sent from Walker Percy? It\u2019s called \u201CAnother Message in the Bottle.\u201D Oh okay. He had written an essay called \u201CA Message in the Bottle\u201D in the 50s and for him that was an essay that \u2014 he would use essays to solve his problems, intellectual problems, and then go into fiction. He solved certain problems about how to diagnose the \u201Ccontemporary malaise,\u201D as he called it in this essay, \u201CThe Message in the Bottle,\u201D and then dramatized those same problems in The Moviegoer, his first and best novel. So at the end of his life he revisited \u201CThe Message in the Bottle\u201D again and tried to make explicit this parallel between Christianity and fiction that had been implicit in so much of his fiction up to that point. Here\u2019s another sentence: \u201CJudeo-Christianity is about pilgrims who have something wrong with them and are embarked on a search to find a way out. This is also what novels are about.\u201D It would fit a lot of novels if you think about it. Percy liked to emphasize that the pilgrim\u2019s search is outside the self, the guru searches within. And he liked to distinguish, a little too glibly in my opinion, between Western and Eastern religion on this score. That Christianity and also fiction, even though they\u2019re capable of some introspection, finally point the reader or the seeker outward into the world of other people and events to find the meaning of things. And for him who was so prone to introspection, this was a kind of rescue. It\u2019s clear to hear the echoes, it\u2019s easy to hear the echoes here with this idea that we began with that you\u2019ve traced in the book of pilgrimage and story. And I think Percy said something like \u201CThe modern predicament makes pilgrimage impossible.\u201D He makes this interesting observation, I mean, it\u2019s one of these things it\u2019s obvious but people don\u2019t point it out very often that, he says that modern experience often comes second hand. Okay. But then he makes this other point that even when we have direct experiences we\u2019re so self conscious that it ruins it. That we\u2019re doomed to imitate life but I think you said that his point was still we have to keep trying to really live. I think that\u2019s right. He used to express this an image of people going to the Grand Canyon and not being able to see the Grand Canyon because they were too busy trying to measure the distance between what they were seeing and the expectation that they had of it from postcards and documentaries and such like. But again, his expectations were great, he was not willing to settle for that and just say this is how it is. So the pilgrim takes that dissatisfaction or that lack of or or that self consciousness and tries to push beyond it, to push through to authentic first hand experience. In the case of Percy, the way out of his self consciousness, which was acute, was to write in the point of view of a character that was not himself. So, in The Moviegoer, it\u2019s narrated by a man named Binx Bolling. He\u2019s a Southerner like Percy, he\u2019s from a wealthy family like Percy, he has a noble ancestor who has kind of raised him, like Percy, and yet he\u2019s not Walker Percy. He\u2019s a much more callow and limited figure but the book is told in the first person so Percy finds his way out of himself by imagining himself into a fictional character. And it was just an incredible breakthrough for him and a sense of the possibilities of art to get beyond self consciousness. So for him to be a novelist really came to seem the solution to grappling with the human condition in his time, in his particular life. Right. And he articulated this in a number of ways. Partly the novelist as a diagnostician, a kind of soul doctor, and partly the novelist as an artist who, who\u2019s trying to lose himself in the work made. That\u2019s the way Maritain, the Catholic philosopher understood art, as self-forgetfulness. And this was true for really all the people this book is about, was different ways of trying to do the fundamental Christian thing of losing oneself in order to find oneself, and to lose oneself in imitation of the divine. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with author Paul Elie. The intersecting stories of Dorothy Day, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Walker Percy and Thomas Merton are the subjects of his book, The Life You Save May Be Your Own. Let\u2019s talk about Thomas Merton, who may be the person who people are more consciously shaped by in terms of just reading his books in our time. And I\u2019ll have to say, again, there\u2019s something about the way you\u2019ve written about him. His thought is in there, the shape pilgrimage took in his life. But it\u2019s all embedded in the life he lived and the person he was. And it\u2019s easy to idealize Merton, this monk, this Trappist monk, with these incredibly wise, wonderful, beautiful writings. And there\u2019s something, at one in the same time, that\u2019s sort of disappointing and also encouraging to get more flesh on those bones and to know how very human he was and that his journey had lots of dark places and lots of confusion and failings. Well, Merton kept very detailed journals, published in seven volumes. These journals are a remarkable account of his life and his inner life. And in my view, they\u2019re a lot more honest than a lot of his published writing. In his published work, he became famous with his first book, really, The Seven Storey Mountain. And there were all sorts of expectations that what the monks should be and what the monks should do and what the monks should say. And he tried to go to the monastery to get away from himself, and suddenly he was the most famous monk in the world because of his autobiography, which sold 600,000 copies, an astonishing number at that time. So a lot of his public work is informed or it\u2019s fraught with these questions of what the monk is supposed to be. And then in the journals, it\u2019s there, too, but it\u2019s just a lot more reliable to me. So, as you say, there\u2019s some disappointments when you realize the banality of some of his days or worrying over things all the time. But I think of him as a person who risked the most of these four writers. He began as a perfectionist and ended somewhere else, much more understanding of his own frailty and just willing to even put it on the page, knowing that we\u2019d be sitting here talking about it years after his death. Yeah. You point out something that I always felt I read The Seven Storey Mountain after I had read some of his other work, and I didn\u2019t really enjoy it. I mean, I find that obviously there\u2019s a great deal in it, but the tone of it is somewhat self-righteous. And you describe this later epiphany that he had, I think, maybe a decade after he wrote The Seven Storey Mountain, where he sort of accepted himself as a full human being. There\u2019s this declaration he made: \u201CI have the immense joy of being a man.\u201D Well, the autobiography was published when he was very young. He was 33, which means he wrote it shortly after turning 30. And he was flush with ardor over his still new religion and still new monastic calling. Dorothy Day said that she thought that he had just gone too far into monastic mysticism in the book, especially at the end of the book. I say that he\u2019s a person who risked a great deal, and one of the risks he took was he was willing to change, even after a famous autobiography was out there saying who he was and what he believed. He recognized that he\u2019d identified being a Catholic and being a monk with apartness and, in a way, with superiority, as you suggest. And then he realized that that wasn\u2019t necessarily the essence of the Christian experience, to be apart or to be superior. On the street that day in Louisville, you mentioned his epiphany. He was in Louisville to go to the doctor\u2019s and walking down the street just in ordinary priest\u2019s clothes but not set apart as a monk. And he just felt like a person walking in rush hour like thousands of other people, and he felt joined to the whole human race. That insight was a reversal of the position of his autobiography, but he was willing to make it and willing to put it out there. And I think that people identify with Merton so much because in a way the entire Catholic Church was turning that corner in this country at that time, from a point of apartness to one of full participation in American society. Thousands of people thought, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t have to flee the world to be a real believer. I can take part and keep faith.\u2019 He stands, for many people, for making this move away from the world, even though his movements later were more and more towards others. You say that pilgrimage for him is a continual voyage out to the other. What do you mean by that? In a sense, the autobiography was like a big letter to the world, the world he had supposedly left behind. Then all the readers that that attracted to him created endless opportunities for dialogue, and he just kept going farther or deeper with it, writing to readers, writing to other writers. Yeah. You document that correspondence, yes. Writing to Walker Percy. And he ends up spending three days with the young Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, and these two monks are sitting there recognizing that what they have in common as monks is more profound than whatever might divide them. And he also died in the Far East attending a conference of Buddhists and Christians. He was in Bangkok. It was 1968. Keep in mind this was a year of terrible violence in America. Martin Luther King had been killed. Robert F. Kennedy had been killed. Merton, in December, set out for Asia. It was his first long trip away from the monastery since he\u2019d entered. The only other trip he\u2019d made was one to Minnesota in 1958 to St. John\u2019s Abbey in Collegeville. Well, he goes to Asia, expecting to travel around for months, and he didn\u2019t know when or how he would come back. He gave a talk to some monastic superiors, Christians, but Asian Christians, many of them. He must have taken a shower and come out and slipped on the wet floor and touched a fan with a loose wire, and he was electrocuted. He was only 58, which is amazing to think. He\u2019d be 89 now. Imagine if Thomas Merton had been around for another 30 years, to think of how much the American religious landscape would reflect his presence if he\u2019d been around for that long. People were so used to Merton investing everything that happened to him with such significance that they had to invest his death with significance. The point that I tried to make in my book is that he was felled by a random accident and it\u2019s a terrible thing but its been suggested that he was moving to some higher plane or committing suicide or other things that I just don\u2019t think make any sense. You know, you just said, \u201CWhat would the American religious landscape be if he had lived another 30 years?\u201D I wonder what other questions like that emerged for you, that are staying with you, that you\u2019re pursuing or puzzling over. Well, the big one has to do with the question you just asked, really. I said, and even now I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s right, that Merton\u2019s many years in the monastery prepared him for this eventual meeting with the Dalai Lama. In a sense, yes. But the four people my book is about all chose a kind of solitude or separateness for themselves. Merton in his monastery. Walker Percy by moving to what he called \u201Cthe pleasant, non-place\u201D of Covington, Louisiana. A pretty anonymous town at the time for someone who had grown up in one of the most illustrious families of the South, he didn\u2019t have any family connections there or any reason to be there. Flannery O\u2019Connor when she became ill with lupus moved to a farmhouse in rural Georgia. And Dorothy Day, although she was in the thick of things in New York, she wasn\u2019t part of the literary world per se, she was down putting out her penny newspaper on the Lower East Side. So they were all separate. And when I was putting the book together I\u2019m just marveling at how separate they really were. Today these people would be on panels probably, they would get so many invitations they would never have any time to do anything else. Yeah. It would be just natural to have a panel, let\u2019s say in Collegeville, Minnesota, with Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, and Walker Percy, and Dorothy Day, or Flannery O\u2019Connor. It\u2019s true, yeah. So, then I ask, and going back to what you said at the beginning of our conversation about their fierceness, I wonder what I\u2019m missing by not choosing that apartness. You know, am I missing a level of depth that they sought and I\u2019m not going after? In our society we seem to just accept the level of busyness as a problem but one we\u2019re not really determined to get past. Is that, are we missing out on something? Or did they actually miss out on something through their apartness? It\u2019s not an answerable question it\u2019s just a question when you\u2019re trying to figure out your own religious life in terms of theirs. Do I go their way or not? How does immersing yourself in the thought and experiences of these four Catholics of the 20th century, how does that make you think differently or reflect on what it is to be Catholic now personally? Well, a lot of things come up, but I\u2019m going to just tell you about two of them. One is it\u2019s to realize how Catholic the Catholic tradition is. Here are four people all\u2026 Catholic with a small c. Yeah. In a sense they\u2019re four answers to every question posed in the book. There\u2019s the way O\u2019Connor would look at it, and the way Percy would look at it, and the way Merton would look at it, and the way Day would look at it. And they\u2019re all faithful. They\u2019re all oriented in the same way, but their different dispositions show different ways to approach these things. So you get a sense of the variety of this tradition, which is often thought to be monolithic or there\u2019s one answer that\u2019s handed down in the catechism, and that\u2019s it for everybody. The other is it\u2019s a book of history about a particular time. These people recognized that they at some point had to live in their own time and not another time. Merton yearned to be a monk of the Middle Ages, but he was a monk of the 1950s, and he came to grips with that. Same with Dorothy Day. She wasn\u2019t living in Tolstoy\u2019s age, she was living in Henry Luce\u2019s age, and she had to deal with that. So for me, as a Catholic, I have to live in our time. And what are the challenges of our time? It\u2019s very tempting to imagine this Golden Age, their age, and try to climb into the time capsule and pull up the ladder, but their lives say you can\u2019t do that, so don\u2019t even try. The title of the book is wonderfully evocative. It comes from Flannery O\u2019Connor, The Life You Save May Be Your Own. I think my last question is, tell me the story of the title, and I\u2019d also like to know what that phrase means to you now after writing all of this down. Well, it comes from a story of Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s. The story was originally called \u201CThe World Is Almost Rotten.\u201D But O\u2019Connor\u2019s friend, Sally Fitzgerald said, \u2018Call it \u201CThe Life You Save May Be Your Own.\u201D\u2018 Because at the end of the story \u2014 it\u2019s about a handyman who moves in with a woman and her sort of mentally feeble daughter and marries the daughter, evidently to get the car and house this family owned, and absconds with her and, I don\u2019t want to spoil the story, but he abandons his new bride and drives down the side of the road off into the distance, passing one of the signs that were on the side of the road during the \u201850s telling people to wear their seatbelts \u201Cbecause the life you save may be your own.\u201D This to me is the pattern of pilgrimage distilled into an expression, \u2018the life you save may be your own.\u2019 Do you think the title, that phrase, has some nuance to it, having written the book, that it didn\u2019t have before? Or did you choose the title after you\u2019d written the book? I chose it about halfway through. O\u2019Connor\u2019s title is now my title. So the process of pilgrimage is how we take other stories and, while remaining faithful to them, make them our own. O\u2019Connor took the stories of her predecessors \u2014 and so did the other three people in the book \u2014 and made them her own. And I hope in some sense I\u2019ve taken their stories and made them my own. Paul Elie is a senior fellow with Georgetown University\u2019s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs.
