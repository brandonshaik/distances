  "fullText": "To dwell on beauty and normalcy \u2014 to reassert the liveliness of ordinary things, precisely in the face of what is hardest and most broken in society. This has been Michael Longley\u2019s gift to Northern Ireland as one of its foremost living poets. I had the pleasure of conversing with him before an adoring audience at the MAC Theatre in Belfast this summer. Like his late friend Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley was known, in part, as a poet of what is called \u201CThe Troubles\u201D \u2014 the bloody 30-year conflict between Protestants and Catholics, English and Irish, that ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. And to this day, Michael Longley is a gentle, winsome force in the ongoing, never-finished work of healing. I think what art can do is to tune you up. And good art, good poems is making people more human, making them more intelligent, making them more sensitive and emotionally pure than they might otherwise be. And one of the marvelous things about poetry is that it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s useless. \u201CWhat use is poetry?\u201D people occasionally ask in the butcher shop, say. They come up to me and they say, \u201CWhat use is poetry?\u201D Right. And the answer is no use, but it doesn\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s without value. It\u2019s without use, but it is valuable. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Michael Longley has published over 20 books of poetry. He was born to English parents who moved to Belfast at the outbreak of World War II and raised him agnostic in the midst of Ireland\u2019s religion-centric divides. He describes himself now as a \u201Csentimental disbeliever.\u201D One thing I was really aware of as we were preparing to come here, and I was preparing to speak with you, is that this is a place that in recent memory has moved away from sectarianism, however humanly and fitfully that happens. And we\u2019re at this moment where it feels like much of the rest of the world is drawing towards sectarianism. So I believe that some of what you know here the rest of us need to know. And a piece of that is the importance of letting the voices of poets rise in the midst of tumult, and be part of our way of finding our way back to the possibility of lived peace, and finding out what that can mean. My wife used to say that she hoped Northern Ireland would become like the rest of the world, and she now points out that the rest of the world is becoming as Northern Ireland used to be. And compared with what Belfast was like ten years ago, the place is unrecognizable. And I\u2019m rather proud. It\u2019s very incomplete and very imperfect, but we\u2019re getting there. So I always begin my conversations, whoever I\u2019m speaking with, whether they are a scientist or a theologian or a poet, by inquiring about the religious or spiritual background of someone\u2019s childhood. And that kind of takes us right into the dynamics here. And it\u2019s a question that I understand has a special intensity and layers of meaning for somebody who was born in a Protestant household of English parents in South Belfast. But when I think of the spiritual background of one\u2019s childhood, I think there\u2019s more to that than religion. I see how much you have thought about and written about your father\u2019s time as, I think you say, a \u201Cboy soldier\u201D in the trenches of the Great War. And you\u2019ve written that he \u2014 when you were growing up, he would scream in his sleep. He was having traumatic memories. And to me, that also feels like part of what would\u2019ve colored your sense of the world, its morality, its safety. Well \u2014 the mystery of his survival. And he joined up as a boy soldier in 1914, and he survived to the end of the war, where the survivor rate was about three weeks at certain times. So that\u2019s a mystery to me that he survived and that I\u2019m here. I do believe in the transcendental. I believe that poetry and art without a transcendental element doesn\u2019t really exist for me. And it is slightly sentimental, as you quote me saying. I mean, once every four or five years, I take communion.And I believe in the poetry of it \u2014 the poetry of it. And I\u2019m interested in Jesus as a revolutionary poet, as a proto-socialist. And the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, are as good a system to live by as any that I can think of. And I love them. I love them. I think this is something you\u2019ve said, that \u201Cpoetry is about all of the things that happen to people. War is one of them.\u201D Did you say that? I always get nervous about quoting things people said to journalists. Does that sound like you? I don\u2019t mind you quoting that. I mean, you may quote some rubbish later on. OK. You call me out if I do. Yeah. I mean, it seems to me, you became, in a sense, one of the people who people would call one of the poets of The Troubles. And that was what was happening to people. Yes. The poets of my generation, Heaney and Mahon and Simmons \u2014 we were very cautious. There was a kind of pressure. During the Second World War, people said, \u201CWhere are the war poets?\u201D And a cry similar to that went up here. And I\u2019ve written somewhere that a poet is not like some super reporter, that the raw material of experience has to settle to a new depth, an imaginative depth where it can then come out as true art. And there was an awful lot of what we call \u201CTrouble\u2019s trash,\u201D dreadful novels and execrable poems. And we avoided that. My friends and, I\u2019d like to think, I avoided that. And the poems eventually came. There\u2019s a lovely poem by Mahon called \u201CAfterlives.\u201D There\u2019s a beautiful poem by Heaney called \u201CCasualty.\u201D And these are immortal poems that were born out of our conflict. And I remember in \u201894, there were rumors that there was going to be IRA ceasefire. And I was reading The Iliad, which is the greatest poem about war and death and suffering. And there\u2019s this wonderful passage in it where the old king of Troy, Priam, goes to the tent, plucks up courage, goes to the tent of Achilles to beg for the body of Hector, his son, whom Achilles has killed, and Achilles is mutilating the body, dragging him after his chariot. And Priam visits Achilles and begs for the body of Hector. And it, for me, is the soul of this great work of art, the first great and probably still the greatest poem in European literature. And I thought, wouldn\u2019t it be marvelous \u2014 this was August, \u201894 \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if I could compress this quite long episode into something like a sonnet and make my own contribution to the peace process, as we called it. And this poem emerged. It\u2019s probably my best known poem. \u201CCeasefire,\u201D right? Should I read it? Yes, please do. \u201CCeasefire.\u201D \u201CI. / Put in mind of his own father and moved to tears / Achilles took him by the hand and pushed the old king / Gently away, but Priam curled up at his feet and / Wept with him until their sadness filled the building. II. / Taking Hector\u2019s corpse into his own hands Achilles / Made sure it was washed and, for the old king\u2019s sake, / Laid out in uniform, ready for Priam to carry / Wrapped like a present home to Troy at daybreak. III. / When they had eaten together, it pleased them both / To stare at each other\u2019s beauty as lovers might, / Achilles built like a god, Priam good-looking still / And full of conversation, who earlier had sighed: IV. / \u2018I get down on my knees and do what must be done / And kiss Achilles\u2019 hand, the killer of my son.\u2019\u201D Now, that appeared then in The Irish Times the week of the ceasefire. And I was walking down the Lisburn Road, and a man came up to me. And he said, \u201CI really admired\u201D \u2014 he called it my Achilles poem. He said, \u201CI really admired your Achilles poem, but I\u2019m not ready for it. My son was the victim earlier this year of a punishment beating. I\u2019m not ready to forgive.\u201D And I wondered to myself, was this poem of mine premature? I mean, I\u2026 Was it what? Premature. Uh-huh. When I wrote it, there was a wonderful guy in Enniskillen called Gordon Wilson. He was a draper, and he was blown up beside his daughter at the Enniskillen atrocity on Remembrance Day. And a couple of days later, with his arm in a sling and plaster on his face, he said to the television cameras that he forgave the killers of his daughter. Didn\u2019t even call them murderers. And I had his face in my mind for Priam when I wrote that poem. Not everybody could behave with an extraordinary, almost superhuman magnanimity of Gordon Wilson. And I thought perhaps my poem might have been premature and that it might have been too symmetrical and neat and tidy. So I wrote a kind of awkward, gauche corollary to \u201CCeasefire.\u201D And I\u2019ll read that one. This is \u201CAll Of These People,\u201D and it\u2019s really my message to the world. It\u2019s in the first line \u2014 in the first couple of lines. \u201CWho was it who suggested that the opposite of war / Is not so much peace as civilisation? / He knew / Our assassinated Catholic greengrocer who died / At Christmas in the arms of our Methodist minister, / And our ice-cream man whose continuing requiem / Is the twenty-one flavors children have by heart. / Our cobbler mends shoes for everybody; our butcher / Blends into his best sausages leeks, garlic, honey; / Our corner shop sells everything from bread to kindling. / Who can bring peace to people who are not civilized? / All of these people, alive or dead, are civilized.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with the great Irish poet Michael Longley, in front of a live audience at The MAC Theatre in Belfast. It seems to me that the distinctive place that you carved out for a poetic voice, an artistic voice, in the midst of this atrocity, was this quiet insistence on celebrating normalcy, and noting normalcy, and the persistence of human activities in life and all its aspects, including the garlic, right? The enlivening details that remained? Well, have you read any concentration camp literature? The greatest book of the last century, for me, is Primo Levi. And in that kind of nightmare, what kept people sane was thinking of the ordinary things back home. And what made things slightly less nightmarish would be securing a toothbrush or a woman\u2019s things for sanitary purposes. And sanity itself depends on these banal, commonplace little things. No doubt about that. I think \u201CThe Ice-Cream Man\u201D is another beloved poem of yours. And would you read that one? Yes. Which \u2014 to that point that you just made. This was a man called Seymour, and he was murdered on the Lisburn Road. And I had been botanizing in the beautiful part of County Mayo, looking for white orchids. And as a little exercise, I put a little green notebook in my pocket, all the flowers I\u2019d seen in one day. And I came back, and this awful thing had happened. And my younger daughter, who was a regular customer and knew all the ice cream flavors by heart \u2014 and she told me the news and that she had used her pocket money to buy a bunch of carnations to lay on the pavement outside. And what I did \u2014 I almost sleep-walked into this poem. I made a kind of pattern of the flower names in my book, and I made a kind of a metaphorical wreath of the flower names. And the poem\u2019s addressed to Sarah, my daughter. \u201CThe Ice-Cream Man.\u201D \u201CRum and raisin, vanilla, butterscotch, walnut, peach: / You would rhyme off the flavours. That was before / They murdered the ice-cream man on the Lisburn Road / And you bought carnations to lay outside his shop. / I named for you all the wild flowers of the Burren / I had seen in one day: thyme, valerian, loosestrife, / Meadowsweet, tway blade, crowfoot, ling, angelica, / Herb robert, marjoram, cow parsley, sundew, vetch, / Mountain avens, wood sage, ragged robin, stitchwort, / Yarrow, lady\u2019s bedstraw, bindweed, bog pimpernel.\u201D And that list is supposed to go on forever, really. If you like, that\u2019s a kind of prayer. That\u2019s an agnostic\u2019s prayer. Now, I just \u2014 if I can find it, I got this wonderful letter when this poem appeared. Is that from the mother, from\u2026 Yes. Yes. I read that she wrote to you, the mother of the ice-cream man. Yes. It says, \u201CDear Mr. Longley, My daughter bought your book, Gorse Fires for me after hearing you on the radio. Your voice on \u2018The Ice-Cream Man\u2019 was clear to us who you were writing about. But I do appreciate very much that someone outside our family circle remembered my son, John. The fact that there were 21 flavors of ice cream in the shop and you wrote 21 flowers was coincidental. I do bless you for your kind thoughts and may God bless you. Sincerely, the Ice-Cream Man\u2019s mother, Rosetta Larmour.\u201D Well, I\u2019m very proud of that letter. Yeah. What does that mean to you, that letter? Everything, really. It means, like, all the good reviews I\u2019ve ever had in my life rolled into one letter by a woman who probably wasn\u2019t a great poetry reader. And there\u2019s something \u2014 I mean, you used the word \u201Ctranscendence\u201D a little while ago, and there\u2019s \u2014 I mean, the flowers that grow so freely are so ordinary but so beautiful and so \u2014 and even the language, right? Their names are so lyrical. It\u2019s almost like each of their names is a poem. Yeah. Well, that is all a transcendental experience for me. My heart stops when I discover an orchid. I nearly crashed the car I was driving with my wife to Mayo a few weeks ago, and there was a huge orchid. You\u2019re supposed to keep your eye on the road. Well, I\u2019m a danger as a motorized botanist. And then, when I hear a bird sing, it goes through me like an electric shock. And these are the things that matter to me. And I would call that transcendental. You can listen again and share this conversation with Michael Longley through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with one of the greatest living poets of Northern Ireland, Michael Longley. His poetry invokes beauty and normalcy, reasserting the vitality of ordinary things, precisely in the face of what is hard and broken in life and society. Together with his late friend Seamus Heaney, he was known as a poet of The Troubles \u2014 the word that recalls the 30-year civil war that left 3,600 people dead and as many as 50,000 thousand injured. It ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, though the long, redemptive work of healing continues. I want to shift a little bit. I listened to something you did for Radio Three a few years ago where they asked poets to write their own version of Rilke\u2019s \u201CLetter To A Young Poet.\u201D Oh, yes. You remember that? I do, yes. It was lovely. I think you addressed yours \u2014 I think it was \u201CDear Allison.\u201D Allison, yes. I wanted a nice middle class Northern Irish name. OK. See, I didn\u2019t get that nuance. You \u2014 so Rilke, in this line, which you quoted to Allison, which I quote all the time \u2014 Rilke wrote about love, that \u201Clove is the utmost, the ultimate trial and test, the work for which all other work is just preparation.\u201D And you\u2019ve said that love poetry is at the heart of the enterprise, but when you say that, you\u2019re taking love out of a little box of romance. I mean, that\u2019s in there, I think, but you say you\u2019re \u2014 love poetry about all of the loves of our lives, love in all its forms. Yeah. I mean, I do believe that if poetry was a wheel, the hub of the wheel is love poetry, but then branching out like spokes are the other affections and obligations and responsibilities and loves, like friendship, and loving your country, loving nature, and so on. Right. I mean, I think even in a couple of the poems you\u2019ve read, \u201CThe Ice-Cream Man\u201D or \u201CAll Those People\u201D \u2014 there\u2019s a love of that particular humanity and of this ordinary beauty that\u2019s growing around us all the time. Yes. There\u2019s a line by John Clare that I adore. I love John Clare. I revere him. \u201CPoets love nature, and themselves are love.\u201D And I believe that with all my heart, really. And part of writing is adoration. For me, celebrating the wildflowers or the birds is like a kind of worship. And I\u2019m so intrigued to put that together with this kind of poetry speaking to The Troubles. But that is also this gentle insistence in your work. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an agenda, right? It\u2019s an effect, right? No. No agenda. And I stagger around. I\u2019m like a blue bottle bumping into walls. And I had a decade when I wrote hardly anything in my 40s, and I thought I was finished. And lo and behold, I started to write again. I mean, I have said that where poems come from, I have no idea. And if I have a plan, if I think, \u201CI\u2019d love to write a poem about that,\u201D and I do a bit of homework on the subject, it doesn\u2019t work at all. I\u2019ve got to be taken by surprise. And if I\u2019m not surprised, nobody else is going to be surprised. I had a \u2014 this professorship. I was the Ireland Professor of Poetry, which sounds wonderful, doesn\u2019t it? Yeah. I think it\u2019s the equivalent of the poet laureate. Is that\u2026? Like that, yes. I wanted to be promoted to the World Poet. And the thing about it was \u2014 meeting the young people, I really loved that and having students. And they used to ask me about my schedule. What do you call it, schedule or schedule? Schedule. Schedule, yes. Yeah. And I used to say, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t write anything for ten years, true. And then, all of a sudden, I write three poems in a day, also true.\u201D So that\u2019s it, you see. I mean, I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t really know where it comes from. And wasn\u2019t it Jesus who said, \u201CIf your left hand knows what your right hand does\u2026?\u201D I think something like that. It might be the other way around, right and left. Sorry, Jesus. The \u2014 \u201Ccut it off.\u201D And I think that\u2019s very good. And I think one can be too self-conscious. I think art and poetry require a certain insouciance. Otherwise, you\u2019d get knotted. And I think it\u2019s very important. You can take your poems seriously, but you mustn\u2019t take yourself seriously. I\u2019m certain of that. And that self-importance engraves its own headstone. Right. No names, no pack drill. I never can think of\u2026 I think you had that in your \u201CLetter to a Young Poet\u201D as well. Yeah, that\u2019s right. That advice. I also \u2014 did I quote my dear friend, old friend, was a wonderful, grumpy man, John Hewitt? I loved him dearly. But he said this wonderful thing to me once. Somebody was complaining within earshot of being under-recognized, and John turned to me, and he says, \u201CIf you write poetry, it\u2019s your own fault.\u201D Isn\u2019t that great? And I believe that too. Well, I know what you did. You said \u2014 Rilke said, \u201COnly write poetry if you must,\u201D right? If you can\u2019t not \u2014 only write if you can\u2019t not write poetry. And you said that that is a more winsome and practical\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s right. \u2026isn\u2019t it as \u2014 yeah. I know nothing more exciting than writing a poem. And all of that ten years, I have hoped that I would write another poem. And I did try, but they were all fakes. If you have quite a lot of technique \u2014 which now, after 60 years scribbling, I have \u2014 it\u2019s too easy to produce forgeries. And there are books upon books full of forgeries. I do believe that, if you don\u2019t have anything to say, say nothing. And that silence is part of the enterprise, and silence is sacred too. So I\u2019ve been writing, scribbling away. I wrote a poem today. Did you? Yeah. I was going to sit down and have a think about myself for you. I was going to try and put on a good show for Krista. But instead of that, you\u2019d be glad to hear, I wrote a poem. Did you bring it with you? Yes. Would you read it to us? Yes. If it can find it in this \u2014 I may not be able to find it. I probably can\u2019t find it. OK. What a \u2014 imagine what a buildup that was, and I can\u2019t find the bloody poem. Yeah. It was from Homer. It was from The Odyssey. But we can put it on hold, can\u2019t we? All right. Yes, we can. So your \u2014 I\u2019ll refer to this one more time \u2014 your \u201CLetter to a Young Poet.\u201D You said your two favorite definitions of \u201Cpoet\u201D are the Scot\u2019s word macher, or maker, and Horace\u2019s phrase, \u201Cpriest of the muses.\u201D And you said that \u2014 you\u2019re talking about this, this magic, this mystery that made poets shamans in other cultures. Yes, that\u2019s right. That you\u2019re aware of that. I agree with that, yes. And you\u2019ve also spoken of the mystery of form. You prefer the word \u201Cshape.\u201D Just talk a little bit about that. It\u2019s so interesting. Oh, that\u2019s \u2014 oh, yeah. I remember a great professor of Greek at Trinity where I read classics, Stanford \u2014 W.B. Stanford, very formidable man. And we were doing Aristotle\u2019s poetics, and he said, \u201CLadies and gentlemen, I want you, next week, to bring your own definition of \u2018poetry.\u2019\u201D And mine was, \u201CIf prose is a river, poetry is a fountain.\u201D In other words, poetry uses language in a way that\u2019s free-flowing, and at the same time, shapely. And I do like the word \u201Cshape.\u201D And there are much looser utterances, say, that I admire, like Walt Whitman, who seems to me a truly great poet. But I would love to be able to write like that, but I can\u2019t. It is extraordinary. You start to write, and the first group of lines is a quatrain. And you haven\u2019t planned that. And then the next group of lines is a quatrain. And say, \u201CCeasefire\u201D \u2014 that began because the episode begins with Priam hugging the knees in supplication of Achilles. I put that at the end, which was a rhyming couplet. \u201CI get down on my knees and do what must be done, and kiss Achilles hand, the killer of my son.\u201C And I remember thinking, if I can extract from this episode four quatrains, I have a sonnet. I solved the whole problem. I worked out what I felt by trying to write a sonnet. Right. So the shape even formed the substance. Yes. They \u2014 in poetry, the music and the meaning are inseparable. That\u2019s the mysterious thing. There\u2019s a beautiful thing \u2014 there\u2019s a poet I had loved meeting in New York called Stanley Kunitz, and he was 100 when I went to see him, beautiful old man. And he wrote in the preface to his collected poems, which I\u2019d recommend to anyone, that form was a way of conserving energy. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? He said the energy soon leaks out of an ill-made work of art. He\u2019s absolutely right. So that\u2019s what form does. I\u2019m going to do my radio thing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this On Being. Today, in a special public conversation at the MAC Theater in Belfast with the poet Michael Longley. I want to ask you also about the mystery of place. And so, Carrigskeewaun is a cottage in County Mayo that you and your wife and family have gone back to it, I believe, for over many years. And you said something wonderful about the beauty of going back to the same place over and over again, that you notice more and more. It\u2019s not that you exhaust a place; that you go more deeply into it. Yes, it\u2019s inexhaustible. Mind you, it is very beautiful, and it\u2019s very remote. And we\u2019ve been going there since 1970. And we carried our children through the river and through the channel, and now they come back over \u2014 such a compliment to my wife and me that the children want to spend time with us. And they come back, and they now bring their children, our grandchildren on their shoulders through this really quite tough terrain. Every time I leave, I think, \u201CWell, there can be no more Carrigskeewaun poems. I\u2019ve exhausted it.\u201D But there always are poems, and the place is inexhaustible. I mean, you know this \u2014 the phrase, \u201CTravel broadens the mind.\u201D We do quite a bit of traveling. But I think it also shallows the mind. But going back to the same place in a devoted way and in a curious way is a huge part of my life. And I\u2019ll be going there even when they have to push me in a wheelchair. Through that rough terrain. Yeah, and I\u2019ll be like Stanley Kunitz, who celebrated his 100th birthday by publishing a book. One poem that I pulled out was \u201CRemembering Carrigskeewaun.\u201D Do you have that one? Or I can \u2014 it\u2019s\u2026 Yes. I think it\u2019s in here. That\u2019s about as\u2026 OK, we\u2019ll see who gets to it first. Yes. See, \u201CI don\u2019t know my way around this book,\u201D he said. That\u2019s not true at all, by the way. Here it is. Here it is. Yeah, this was a very special day when the children were young, and I\u2019m remembering that day in Belfast, thinking of the details. And this is a hymn, if you like. \u201CRemembering Carrigskeewaun.\u201D \u201CA wintry night, the hearth inhales / And the chimney becomes a windpipe / Fluffy with soot and thistledown, / A voice-box recalling animals: / The leveret come of age, snipe / At an angle, then the porpoises\u2019 / Demonstration of meaningless smiles. / Home is a hollow between the waves, / A clump of nettles, feathery winds, / And memory no longer than a day / When the animals come back to me / From the townland of Carrigskeewaun, / From a page lit by the Milky Way.\u201D You like that one? I do. You said to \u2014 in another interview, you said, \u201CI don\u2019t go to Carrigskeewaun for escapist reasons. I want the beauty, the psychedelic wildflowers, the call of the wild birds, I want all of that shimmering beauty to illuminate the northern darkness. We have peace of a kind, but no cultural resolution. The tensions which produced The Troubles are still there. It is important for me to see beautiful Carrigskeewaun as part of the same island as Belfast.\u201D Yeah. Well, I can\u2019t improve on that, Krista. I just \u2014 I want to keep shining a light on this gentle way that your poetry speaks indirectly, but very directly, with beauty and with normalcy, with ordinary things, with the liveliness of ordinary things to also what is hardest and most broken. Yes. I\u2019ve very complicated feelings about this. I don\u2019t altogether like the idea that art can be a solace. I heartily dislike the idea that this civic commotion here might be good for art. I really dislike that. That\u2019s on the same level as a big room in the museum devoted to The Troubles. I don\u2019t like that. Right. So what is it? So what is that? What does poetry do? What does it work if it\u2019s not solace? Well, it\u2019s much more complicated than solace. I like the Aristotelian notion of catharsis. And I think what art can do is to tune you up. I mean, if you think of an out-of-tune violin, and tuning it up so that it\u2019s in tune, I think that\u2019s what art is, and that\u2019s what art does. And good art, good poems is making people more human, making them more intelligent, making them more sensitive and emotionally pure than they might otherwise be. Does that make sense to you? Yes, yes. Yeah. And one of the marvelous things about poetry is that it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s useless. \u201CWhat use is poetry?\u201D people occasionally ask in the butcher shop, say. They come up to me, and they say, \u201CWhat use is poetry?\u201D And the answer is no use, but it doesn\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s without value. It\u2019s without use, but it has value. It has \u2014 it is valuable. And it\u2019s the first thing \u2014 the first people that dictators try to get rid of are the poets, and the artists, and the novelists, and the playwrights. They burn their books. They\u2019re terrified of what poetry can do. It keeps imagination alive. It means that \u2014 poetry encourages you to think for yourself and to disregard church and state. It does. And but that\u2019s not exactly use \u2014 that just means it\u2019s got value. The image that I love the most \u2014 I\u2019ve loved it for years and years \u2014 is English critic, Cyril Connolly, and he compared the arts to a little gland in the body, like the pituitary gland, which is at the base of the spine. And it seems very small and unimportant, but when it\u2019s removed, the body dies. Yeah. In the ashes outside the crematorium in Auschwitz, they discovered scraps of poems. And these are people who were going to their deaths, and they found time to write a poem. Well, I mean, that says it all, doesn\u2019t it? It just \u2014 it\u2019s a normal \u2014 it\u2019s a human act of \u2014 a normal human activity. I like that idea. It\u2019s a normal human activity. And even in extremes, we\u2019ll turn to it. And even if we\u2019re not writing poems ourselves, we will say poems to ourselves. Even sometimes not realizing they\u2019re poems. Yes, perhaps. Perhaps, yes. When you were speaking a minute ago about form, the shape that words take, and how important that is, and how it also shapes what is said, the effect of what is said, it also strikes me that that\u2019s \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t want to be too linear \u2014 but it\u2019s modeling something like a care with words as a core value, as something at the essence of poetry. Poetry would not exist without that care with words. That becomes such a critical work for our society, right? Civic work. One of the duties of the writer or the poet is to use words with precision. I think what poetry does is it uses words at their most precise and their most suggestive. And one word out of place, and the poem\u2019s dead. It\u2019s shocking, but that\u2019s true. And the poets \u2014 our poets are custodians of the language. I mean, that sounds very grandiose, but I do believe it. And it\u2019s time to quote somebody else. Let me quote the end of \u201CMossbawn: Sunlight\u201D by Heaney. \u201CAnd here is love, like a tinsmith\u2019s scoop, sunk past its gleam, in the meal bin.\u201D How simple and pure, you know? And I love that. And then, I\u2019ll give you some American poetry. Wallace Stevens. \u201COh, blessed rage for order, pale Ramon, / The maker\u2019s rage to order words of the sea, / Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred, / And of ourselves and of our origins, / In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.\u201D Now, I haven\u2019t a clue what that\u2019s about. I\u2019m so glad. But it\u2019s about everything, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just \u2014 and I\u2019ve had those lines by heart since I was about 20. And when you hear him read them \u2014 he was a great reader. And he\u2019s the only poet I know of who was the vice president of a major insurance company. Not many of them around. I\u2019m going to \u2014 someone wrote this about you. And I believe you met him at Corrymeela. Richard Rankin Russell? Oh, yes. \u201CLongley\u2019s poetry, like Auden\u2019s before him, is religious in the best sense of the word, deriving from its Latin root, religare, meaning to bind fast or connect.\u201D Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. Will you take that? I\u2019ll accept that as a compliment, yes. Yeah, but I wouldn\u2019t dwell on it. That\u2019s the thing \u2014 my wife always says about compliments, she says, \u201CYeah, you accept them, but you don\u2019t inhale.\u201D Well, I\u2019d like to maybe \u2014 I would ask you one question, which is a vast question. So just how would you start to reflect on this \u2014 through this life you\u2019ve lived and the poetry that has been this magical part of what you\u2019ve brought into the world, how do you think about what it means to be human? What have you learned about that? Well, poets are no less or no more human than anyone else. For me, it\u2019s quite an extraordinary gift to see something beautiful, say, like a lark or a flower and to write about it. And for me, no experience is complete, really, until I\u2019ve written about it. And that\u2019s extraordinary. And it\u2019s a way of having more than one life. And I mean, I have actually been in quite intelligent conversation with people, and they don\u2019t realize that in the back of my head, I\u2019m finishing a poem. So I have this secret life that nobody knows about, except my wife who\u2019s the closest witness to what it\u2019s all about and the best judge I know. Michael Longley, thank you so much. Michael Longley has written more than 20 books of poetry including Collected Poems, Gorse Fires, and his most recent collection, The Stairwell.
