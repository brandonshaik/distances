  "fullText": "I want so much to touch those things in my life and in my work, and I just keep looking for the veil to be lifted even in a fraction of a moment you know. I\u2019m always looking for that. That\u2019s my religious desire. \u201CMystical\u201D is one of the unexpected words the singer/writer Rosanne Cash uses to describe her father Johnny Cash. But it also applies to this daughter\u2019s mind and spirit. She\u2019s a mother of five; a lover of language and of physics who surprised herself by becoming a performer. She\u2019s lost her voice for a stretch of years and had brain surgery. The legacy of Johnny Cash weaves throughout a conversation with her. So does his death in 2003, and the \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D album she created from that same period in which she also lost her mother and her stepmother June Carter Cash. The songs that emerged, like all of her music these days, are full of life in the raw and of some form of \u201Ctime travel.\u201D That\u2019s a phrase Rosanne Cash likes and gives new meaning. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. And this is On Being. I sat down with Rosanne Cash in 2011, backstage at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. She arrived with her longtime manager Danny Kahn and her husband, the musician and producer John Leventhal. He\u2019s known to her Twitter followers as the mysterious \u201CMr. L;\u201D and he\u2019ll pick up his guitar for us in a little while. I want to start where I start with everybody. I just want to hear a little bit about the religious and spiritual background that was there in your childhood. Well, both of my parents were very religious. My mother was a strict Catholic. My father, even though he was a Southern Baptist, had \u2014 he was a mystic. You know, he really looked for the mystical and religion and in all of life. But my father had to sign a paper when he married my mom, saying that he \u2014 the children could be raised Catholic. And then when we \u2014 my parents split up and we visited my dad in summer. My mother made him promise that he would take us to Mass on Sundays. So he did. He was very dutiful about that, you know. I could \u2014 I have to admire that now. He would sit in the back row and wait for us. And when I was about 15, I said, \u201CI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201D And he said, \u201CBut, you know, I promised your mother.\u201D I said, \u201CI won\u2019t tell her, if you won\u2019t.\u201D And I could see it was a moral dilemma for him, but he let me stop. Right. And then the element, which I also think of as a spiritual element of your life was music, right? Mm, still is. There\u2019s this phrase in your memoir: \u201CA life circumscribed by music.\u201D So, you know, what was the shape of that growing up? How did that look like to have a life circumscribed by music? Well, I was really oppressed by what I thought what spirituality was, you know. Sin, original sin \u2014 all of these concepts weighed really heavily on me. I took it seriously. And it took me a long time to first start shedding the way I had felt restricted by it and the punitive aspects of it. And then it took me well into my 20s and early 30s to really find something that was mine. And to realize that art and music was the kind of deity I was looking for. That it was all there. The source of all creativity, light, enlightenment, beauty, revelation, inspiration, all those things were in art and music. So I said well that\u2019s good enough for me. Mm-hmm. And it seems like you\u2019ve really experienced yourself to be a writer\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026 before \u2014 then you became a writer, um, of music and a musician as well. Yeah. I started writing. I mean I loved language from the beginning. I was a kid who asked my mother to drop me at the library on Saturdays. I was very \u2014 I was really geeky. Mm-hmm. You know, I just would hole up with a book forever. I didn\u2019t think I would become a musician because I thought that meant that you would have a public life and get famous, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. Well, you saw that too? Yeah. I mean my mother\u2019s version of things was that if you, um, were a musician or performer, you were away from home all the time and you didn\u2019t have a private life and you got on drugs and you got divorced and had affairs and, you know, it didn\u2019t sound very appealing. Yeah, what \u2014 what she had \u2014 she experienced that right? She experienced all of that, right, that was\u2026 And then, you know, I think it\u2019s\u2026 \u2026 true for her. It\u2019s so interesting when you \u2014 you describe after graduating from high school, you joined your father\u2019s tour. And you also had your own close-up experience of all of that. Yeah, that lifestyle didn\u2019t appeal to me. What appealed to me was the hard work to show up for my job. And if art and music were the religion, then the hard work was the, you know, the dogma. Yeah, or the sacrament or the ritual? Yes, exactly. The sacrament, that\u2019s a better word, yeah. Mm-hmm. Something else that really interested me, I think this is \u2014 I think you wrote about this especially in your memoir. You talked about how your father \u2014 in that experience, you really saw how your father was his best self on stage. Yes. And I\u2019ve known performers, also, who are incredibly private, but then they kind of come alive on stage. But something you describe is \u2014 it was like there were relational things that happened. Oh, yeah. Well, he was a special performer, and he took all of his problems to the stage, to the spotlight, you know? It was like, being bathed in light in a literal sense, he really worked things out. He healed things. Mm-hmm. He asked June to marry him on stage, you know? Right. Right. He felt his most natural self on stage, his largest self. And you also had experiences with him on stage, right? Yeah. Yeah, I talked about this in my memoir, that the last time he played Carnegie Hall and he wanted me to sing a song with him \u2014 \u201CI Still Miss Someone,\u201D which is one of his greatest songs. And I was mad at him for some reason and I said no, you know, what a brat. And then I said no like a couple times \u2014 he asked me three or four times and I kept saying no. And then we were at the hotel about to go to Carnegie Hall and he asked me once more. And I said no again, and then he turned \u2014 he said OK, and he turned away. And the look of his back struck me, like, \u2019cause I had seen that angle of his back from the wings so many times and it filled me with so much love for him. It really moved me deeply because that\u2019s \u2014 you know, seeing my dad on stage, was seeing my dad. It was really seeing into his soul. So I said wait, I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll do it. And it worked out like I hoped, you know, like I didn\u2019t even know I hoped, but it worked out. I sang with him and it all got fixed. On stage? On stage. That still happens, you know. Sometimes I\u2019m playing with my husband on stage and we\u2019ve gotten in an argument or something or you know, are tired and cranky, and it will all get worked out in some solo he plays or some notes. But it\u2019s about the music then, not about the spotlights and the audience. Yeah, it\u2019s about the \u2014 no it\u2019s about the music. Yeah. So the music then kind of transcends even that setting and \u2014 is that what you are saying and the fact that they\u2019re there. Sure. You know when I first became a performer, I was so anxious about it and it took me a long time to grow into it, because I thought that being a performer was about getting a lot of attention and I didn\u2019t want that much attention. I liked the writer\u2019s life. I liked the privacy and the solitude and being inside my own little mind cave. And over time I realized that it\u2019s not about the attention, it\u2019s about the energy exchange. I\u2019m doing something for them, but they\u2019re doing something for me too, you know? And there\u2019s no hierarchy really. It\u2019s \u2014 and some nights that exchange is so beautiful, you know, I can feel my own energy stretching out to the far reaches of the room and theirs coming back. And there\u2019s something sublime about it, and also the temporal nature of it that at the end of the night it\u2019s over. Right. It\u2019s like a monk\u2019s sand painting, it\u2019s wiped clean. And so you can\u2019t grab it, you know, which is part of the \u2014 the mystical beauty of it. You can\u2019t repeat it. You know, the next night might be just awful, like, your energy might not expand beyond two feet beyond you and they are not giving you anything and it doesn\u2019t work, but you know, that\u2019s the way life is. Yeah, it\u2019s that spiritual discipline of knowing impermanence. Knowing impermanence and showing up even though you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being \u2014 with the singer and writer Rosanne Cash backstage at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. Were you surprised at times I mean, you know, when I read about you, you had a lot of reasons to resist going into that same profession that you\u2019ve been surrounded with, and you seem to always have been pretty aware what you didn\u2019t like. Yes. Mm-hmm. Um, and then, you know, when somebody reads your biography, then suddenly in the \u201980s you start having hit songs. Yeah. And, um, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s striking. Did you wake up sometimes and say how did this happen? Sure. I still do. I \u2014 yeah, uh, the trajectory of my career and my work has been one of spirals. Like, I had a lot of success in the beginning and not a lot of confidence or mastery in what I was doing. I was just kind of fumbling. So then later on, I had a lot less success, but I developed more mastery and I became comfortable with the idea of not having as much success as gotten used to in the beginning. It all became fine. It all kind of just focused into what my work was, and the reverberations of that were really beyond my control, you know. And there\u2019s a lot of love in that, you know? What do you mean by that? Well, my friend Steven Pressfield, he wrote this great book called The War of Art, and he has this great line in it. He says, \u201CYou have to show the Muse you\u2019re serious.\u201D You know, you can\u2019t just expect to be hit by these beautiful bolts of inspiration and lightning. You have to keep showing up even if you don\u2019t get hit for a year or two years. Just show the Muse you are serious. And then that the relationship there feels like love to me. I mean, it feels like the heart opening. I think my favorite song on the \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D album is \u201CI Was Watching You\u201D\u2026 Yeah. \u2026 which really is about love. And time travel. Yeah, well it\u2019s about love before life and beyond life. Yeah. That song was really odd in that it started with an image instead of a line. Usually, when I\u2019m writing, a phrase or a line or, you know, a couplet will come to me and that\u2019s where this song will start. This song, I was just sitting at the piano and I saw this Texas road with headlights on it. And so that was the first line of the song: \u201CHeadlights on a Texas road.\u201D And then it started developing, I didn\u2019t know where it was going. And then I saw three verses: one before life, one during, and one after life, and that love was the constant. You know, and that what survives of us is love. It\u2019s like that Phillip Larkin poem, so the song was kind of there. Sometimes I think songs are there in the ether and you just have to have your skills good enough to get them. Right. You \u2014 you used a phrase somewhere, the same phrase that Bobby McFerrin used with me, that you catch songs. Yeah. Which is a similar image. I was just going to say you have your catcher\u2019s mitt on. Which is just fascinating to think about. Yeah, and sometimes I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t get it down, then somebody else will get it. Yeah. Like, I don\u2019t want, you know, I don\u2019t want Lucinda to get this one. Right. So, you know, this \u2014 I didn\u2019t expect to think about this, but something that I\u2019ve talked about with scientists is, um, there\u2019s this debate in science about whether \u2014 like, say whether mathematics is invented or discovered. Do we come up with it or is it, you know, is it somewhere \u2014 is it somewhere in the fabric of the universe and we\u2019re able to turn it into an equation? And it seems to me that it\u2019s a similar idea to what you just said. It\u2019s the same thing and now you\u2019ve stumbled on an area that I\u2019m endlessly obsessed and fascinated with. Because fractals in nature, that perfection of math, that to me is God. And that\u2019s the same thing as art, you know, that there\u2019s some creative force that organizes all of these things. And like you just said, we glimpse it. We can just a little bit see it, you know, and understand it. And our math is like the fumblings of a, you know, a toddler trying to talk about something that already exists that\u2019s so perfect and so complicated and full of so much mystery that we can barely touch it. And, you know, some of the people I trust the most to wrestle with this question of invented or discovered, well what they\u2019ll say is it\u2019s both, right? Well, sure. Which is a way of talking about creativity as well? Yeah. Sure. Because if you don\u2019t have the skills to interpret it or bring it into being or create it, you know, then it\u2019s somewhere else. It\u2019s still out there, but it\u2019s lost. Right. I mean, there\u2019s the image that you got, the picture of the highway to Texas, and then you turn it into something and so it\u2019s both and\u2026 Well, then there\u2019s also that, you know, the unknown element of genius. There are some people, some writers, some songwriters I admire that I consider genius and that I\u2019ll never be \u2014 no matter how hard I worked, I wouldn\u2019t have the skills to catch those songs. Is that how you think of it? Yes. Right. And a physicist will say only an Einstein could write E=mc2. Yes. Right. But I could, you know, I could work on my own skills enough to get the best songs I could possible get. Mm-hmm. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. That\u2019s my life. So \u2014 so here\u2019s something else, and again with \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D, that I thought about. So the song \u2014 a really, really religious song, \u201CGod is in the roses and the thorns,\u201D so, you know, and this often true of beautiful songs, if that were just a sentence on a page, you know, just a line of poetry\u2026 Mm-hmm. It would be trite. Exactly. Yeah. It\u2019s very, very, very simple. So there\u2019s something that you do that is different when you turn words into song or that the music transforms the mere words. Absolutely. Some of my songs wouldn\u2019t stand alone as poetry, Some would, I think; some wouldn\u2019t because of the very thing you are talking about. Because they are so, um, bound to the melody or the backbeat, you know, that they can\u2019t be separated. I\u2019m about to do this project with a painter I know. He wants to use my lyrics and do paintings with them \u2014 like include them in the paintings. I was a little worried about that in the beginning, like, what would the lyrics stand alone. Let me pick the lines, you know, but, um, yeah, I mean, that\u2019s by nature \u2014 the definition of songs is that the music is half of it. But you said now, that \u201CGod is in the Roses\u201D was the most, quote, religious song. Well, it \u2014 it\u2019s an overtly religious song. It\u2019s a God song. Yeah, yeah, except the imagery in it is not necessarily religious, because, um, you know, the last verse about \u2014 the middle verse about being in the cemetery. \u201CThe sun is on the cemetery, leaves are on the stones, there never was a place on earth that felt so much like home.\u201D That came because the day after we buried my dad, I got up at 5:00 in the morning and waited for the Starbucks to open and got coffee and went and sat on his grave and watched the sun rise \u2014 the sun, yeah, the sun rise on his grave. And it was really comforting to me. I took two cups of coffee. So you could stay for a long time? No, for him \u2014 one for him. Oh, you did, really? Yeah. And I felt so at peace watching the sun rise on his grave and then that gave me that verse. But then I wanted to go out to, you know, more than just my personal experience, when I\u2019m saying, I love you like a brother, father and a son. And now when I sing that live, I sing, I love you all like brothers. Hmm. How did that happen? I don\u2019t know, because I feel a lot of peace and again love when I sing that song, and compassion for people who have lost people. Mm-hmm. We should sing \u201CGod is in the Roses.\u201D I should sing it. John should play it though, because I, uh\u2026 Yeah, that would be great. Do you want to play it? Um, sure. So the reason I asked John to play it \u2014 I wrote this song on, um, you know, like I wrote it like a little folk song. And then when we recorded it, actually Bill Bottrell produced this, you know, he transcended it into something else. And then John when he plays it live transcends it into something else too. Your Web viewers are going to enjoy this tuning moment. Yes, they will. They will actually. All right. Are we ready? I kind of know about writing writing; I wonder if it\u2019s true of making an album. I mean, the \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D album had a lot to do with this period of grieving and mourning and loss, and also healing \u2014 it feels like there\u2019s healing in there too. And then you did this earlier album, Interiors, which had to do with the unraveling of your first marriage. Is there a way in which you work through things in the process of getting that music out into the world? Is it\u2026 Well, yes. Although, I hesitate to say that, because to just think of it as therapy or catharsis diminishes it to me, because, you know, it\u2019s suppose to be a work of art and music and that\u2019s beyond therapy. I mean, just to say it\u2019s therapy is, you know, it\u2019s just narcissism then. But the bigger answer is yes, of course. And a lot of times, I don\u2019t even know what is going on until I write about it. And sometimes it\u2019s even outside of linear time and then it happens later on. And I say, \u201COK, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, that\u2019s where, you know, what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s what\u2019s coming up.\u201D Yeah, getting it on the written page, finding a melody to put to it, that organizes my life and keeps me sane. Right. I guess I imagine that you put an end to a project like that. I mean, obviously the loss doesn\u2019t end, the mourning doesn\u2019t end, but you \u2014 I can imagine that you walk away from that project still different. You\u2019ve walked through the experience with tools that everyone doesn\u2019t have to turn it into art. Well, I do remember when I was writing the songs for \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D feeling really sorry for my sisters that they couldn\u2019t write songs, because it gave me a lot of relief. It was just this intense pain, and to write a song let me know that there was still something alive in it, you know? Mm-hmm. And \u201CGod is in the Roses,\u201D um, was because in a moment of real mourning and loss, I still felt the presence of light. And I thought, wow, there\u2019s a conundrum, you know, but it exists, that even in the darkest, darkest times there\u2019s this overriding \u2014 light is the only word I can think of to put to it. I mean, I guess some people would call that God. We live-streamed my entire backstage conversation and musical encounter with Rosanne Cash. You can watch it now at onbeing.org. Coming up, Rosanne Cash on how the \u201Ccaf\u00E9 society\u201D of Twitter has enriched her life; and the backstory to her Twitter self-designation as Buddhiscopalian. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being \u2013 Today, \u201CRosanne Cash, Time Traveler.\u201D I sat down with the writer, musician, and Twitter poet at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. The memory of her father Johnny Cash weaves throughout our conversation, as does his death in 2003. Her 2006 album, \u201CBlack Cadillac,\u201D was borne of that grief and love. I wanted to get close to this personal, reflective even mystical side of Rosanne Cash. And she let me. I mean we\u2019re talking about this entire time \u2014 I would like to just ask you how your sense of the meaning of making music \u2014 the practice of music, I mean, how your sense of that has changed across time. I see, I think, we are already there, we\u2019re already in that, but have there been some other turning points, um, big realizations? Well, sure. Well, I loss my voice for two and half years, and that was a huge turning point for me. And I said to myself, if I ever get it back, I\u2019m not going to take it for granted anymore. And you know, I pretty much kept that promise and not to criticize it in my head constantly. And so I\u2019ve let a lot of that go. But also, I this dream I had that, you know \u2014 I was in Jungian analysis for 10 years, and it\u2019s great for creative people because it\u2019s all about mining your dreams and, you know, externalizing things you have in yourself and, you know, kind of making them people and talking to them \u2014 and all of this great creative work that led to a lot of songs for me. But Jung said that a person will have five big dreams in her life. And there\u2019s this dream about art that was my first big dream or maybe I had one before that, but \u2014 in childhood but I don\u2019t know. But it was about seeing Art at a party, this old man named Art, and he turned his back to me and he said we don\u2019t respect dilettantes. And it crushed me. I woke up from the dream crying. I was crushed. And also really scared that I was leading myself into an ever-narrowing kind of corner with my work and that if I just kept dabbling in, you know, trying to make hit records and not really going deeper into what I did and trying to develop some mastery of it, that that was it: I was going to end up doing parodies of myself. And it woke me up. And I started taking voice lessons and I started painting to see what it felt like to have the absence of words, you know, and to learn what I did in songwriting. I did the same thing in painting. You know, I set up all of these kind of lessons for myself. And I\u2019ve never forgotten that dream or the lesson it imparted and I\u2019m scared to loose it, I\u2019m scared to dream of Art again and have him turn his back to me. How old were you when that was happening? Oh, I was 33. So you still have three big dreams left. I guess I do. And then of course you had this brain surgery? Yeah, I had brain surgery. That was later? Yeah, I \u2014 that felt when \u2014 when I finally got diagnosed \u2014 I had had headaches for years and when I finally got diagnosed it felt right when he said you\u2019re going to have to have surgery. I kind of took \u2014 just sighed with relief, like, that\u2019s right. I kind of knew I was going to this place and I\u2019m so glad somebody finally knows what\u2019s wrong and it just felt right. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t scared to death, I was, but I knew it was the right thing to do. And then I got really, really interested in neuroscience and\u2026 Did that \u2014 was that the precursor of the fractals? No, because I was \u2014 I\u2019ve always been interested in quantum mechanics. And even when I was 24, I kind of had a newborn baby and I marched myself down to the community college to see if I could take a course in quantum physics. And I read lay books on physics that I could understand. And, you know, I have a couple of friends who are physicists, and they will deign to dumb down to me and try to explain things to me. There\u2019s such poetry in quantum physics, though. The language is so beautiful and the concepts, you know: Schr\u00F6dinger\u2019s Cat \u2014 is the cat there, is he not there? The cat is dead and alive at the same time. Right. There\u2019s so much creativity implicit in it. Right. It\u2019s so beautiful. And then, you know, the fractals \u2014 that kind of perfection opened my eyes, when I first realized that that was something that existed. It was almost frightening, like, I can\u2019t even grasp this. But science and quantum science particularly \u2014 that is like a religion to me, you know. And I started to think \u2014 I really believe now that when people talk about heaven, they\u2019re talking about a parallel universe. Right. You know, one of the things I didn\u2019t want to do, when I though about interviewing you, is asking you the questions I think you get asked a lot. That\u2019s OK. And I really want to talk about you and not your father \u2014 or your father is of course, he\u2019s a huge part of you \u2014 but The List, you know, is, um, there\u2019s been a book written about The List and you and this in your life and, um, I just wonder if you would tell a little bit of that story and how the importance of it evolved and what that means for you even, as a musician, as a person, Sure. Well, I went on the road with my dad directly after high school. I was 18, and I learned how to play guitar on that tour. I was so into it and I was so into being with my dad for a long extended period and immersed in his life and there were long hours on the bus and we would play songs. He would play songs with everyone, and he said to me \u2014 one day he said, do you know such and such a song. I said, \u201CNo.\u201D And he looked a little alarmed, he said, \u201CDo you know this song.\u201D I said, \u201CNo.\u201D Then he got really worried and he spent the rest of the afternoon making a list for me of what he called 100 essential country songs. And he gave me the list and he said this is your education. And I wanted it. I think that even if he\u2019d given it to me two years earlier, I would have been like a teenager, like, \u201COh, OK.\u201D You know, but I wanted it. I was learning to play guitar, I was \u2014 wanted to be \u2014 I could sense that he was giving me a huge part of himself. And so I saved the list and I did learn the songs. I did learn the songs. And I put the list a way and I just where ever I moved, I carried it in my box of letters and memorabilia and didn\u2019t think much about it. And then after \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D, it was so intense, such an intense experience emotionally, you know, and to do those songs about mourning and death every night it was just \u2014 I was exhausted at the end of it. And I said I want to make a cover record next. And John, my husband, said, \u201CWell, if you are going to make a cover record, it\u2019s got to be the list.\u201D And it hit me: Well, of course. Right. And the other thing that hit me at the same time is that, if I didn\u2019t claim my own legacy someone else would co-opt it. It would happen. Mm-hmm. Why was I pushing away this thing that was so essential to my own nature, that was important to my children? It was time to claim it. Mm-hmm. Was it fun? Was it\u2026 Yeah, it was fun. I was still recovering from brain surgery, so I couldn\u2019t have spent as long hours in the studio as I usually could, but the songs themselves were, as we said, they were healing and it was exciting. When I was recording it, I kept thinking, \u201COh, my God, if Dad could hear me sing \u2018Long Black Veil,\u2019 he would fall over. He wouldn\u2019t believe it. He would be so happy.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being \u2014 with the musician and writer Rosanne Cash backstage at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. So let\u2019s talk about Twitter. I mean, this is another thing. Are you surprised? Well, first of all none of us would ever have imagined Twitter. No. But this has become I would say especially with you, it\u2019s \u2014 you have a big Twitter presence, it\u2019s a big part of your public persona? Yeah, I don\u2019t do Facebook. I don\u2019t \u2014 I mean the record label does; I don\u2019t go on there. Twitter seems perfect for me. It\u2019s, you know, 140 characters, as Mike Doughty says, \u201CIt\u2019s boot camp for songwriters.\u201D If you can say it succinctly and somewhat poetically or with humor in 140 characters, that\u2019s great for refining the skills as a songwriter. And also, I mean, much more than that, the caf\u00E9 society that Twitter is, is so wonderful. Mm-hmm. I have met, you know, professor of philosophy, other musicians, writers, moms, doctors, tons of media people. It\u2019s really great. And I\u2019ve learned a lot. And made real friends, you know? Yeah. Right, and that\u2019s a little bit counterintuitive. And also what\u2019s interesting to me is, people often use the words \u201Cbrainy\u201D and \u201CTwitter\u201D with you in the same sentence, and I wonder just as you say that, I wonder if it\u2019s partly because you \u2014 it\u2019s this art of songwriting that\u2026 Well, yeah, also because I\u2019m a geek and I like really geeky things. Like they posted a periodic table that was interactive. I was just on that like a game forever. And, you know, the whole Jane Austen thing: I try out my Jane Austen persona on Twitter, which is really fun and that also helps hone language too. And I love language. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s fun. And the one of the really fun things that has happened on Twitter recently is, I met this woman who is a knitting teacher and she writes knitting books \u2014 Kay Gardiner. And I asked her to give me a lesson. So I learned how to knit from Twitter. Did you do it on Twitter or you\u2026 No she\u2019s come\u2026 You had to connect. Right. We fist met in a coffee shop so I could make sure she wasn\u2019t a psycho. Right. Yeah. And then she came to my house. And you do describe yourself there as a neo-folk, Buddha \u2014 Buddhiscopalian? Buddhiscopalian. Pagan, post-feminist, progressive. Did I get it right? Yeah, that almost covers it. OK. You know, I put progressive on there so that some of these people who follow me, who expect me to be something different don\u2019t get a nasty surprise. And you know, some of it is just kind of tweaking people. But Buddhiscopalian is actually kind of close to what I feel myself to be in religious terms. Buddhist because I actually studied more about Buddhism than I did any other religion, and it makes the most sense to me \u2014 self-awareness, compassion, nonviolence, what else\u2026 Also, impermanence that we talked about. The impermanence, right \u2014 performance, right. But, you know, compassion, nonviolence, what else do you need in a religion? I don\u2019t need to play team sports in a religion. And Episcopal, because my girls went to an Episcopal school and I loved the church \u2014 it\u2019s in Greenwich Village and they do a lot of outreach to gay, homeless, young people. So that\u2019s a progressive church; they\u2019re very ecumenical. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s somewhere that you \u2014 you use this phrase \u201Cthe pantheon of my religious desires,\u201D which is also another way of evoking that list. Yeah. Yeah, religious capital R, not religious as in religion so much as in that great expanse of creativity and spirituality that is all the same thing to me. Mm-hmm. And I want so much to touch those things in my life and in my work, and I just keep looking for the veil to be lifted even in a fraction of a moment, you know, I\u2019m always looking for that. That\u2019s my religious desire. Is mystery a word you use? Carefully. I use the word mystery carefully. There are mysteries, you know; fractals are a mystery. And songwriting is somewhat mysterious \u2014 there are mysterious moments. And I like living with the questions, rather than the answers. Tom Waits said this great thing about songwriting. He said he was driving in a car on the freeway and he got an idea for a song and it was just, you know, like overwhelming him, the idea for this song, and he couldn\u2019t get a pencil and there was no paper. And he\u2019s on the freeway and he finally just looked up at the sky and said, \u201CDon\u2019t you see I\u2019m driving?\u201D And I feel that way sometimes too. Don\u2019t you see I\u2019m getting my child off to school or helping with homework or, you know, just trying to be available? Mm-hmm. One thing that I think is really intriguing in your stories \u2014 that I want to ask you about is your \u2014 is the sense of place in your life in music. I mean, you were born in Memphis, but then you moved to California. But what\u2019s more obvious is this Nashville-New York axis. Mm-hmm. And then I \u2014 I also think of this in the sense of place category: You went and sang at Folsom Prison, you and John, this March 2011. Yeah. What was that like? That was a time travel experience too. Some of these experiences that have this sense of mystery about them like that have something to do with time travel. It\u2019s so strange. We went there \u2014 they asked us to play for and to speak with their music and art program and \u2014 in maximum security. So we went and we played some songs for them. They played some songs for us. A couple people read poems. They asked questions, you know, it was a true give and take. And they had been very carefully vetted, the men who came to this. And it was very moving. And one man said to me \u2014 you know, my \u2014 of course, you know, my father recorded this famous record at Folsom. Right. He also recorded a very famous record at San Quentin. And one man said to me, when we were there, he said, \u201CI was at San Quentin when your dad recorded the album,\u201D and now he\u2019s at Folsom, so\u2026 Right. He spent virtually his entire life imprisoned and he, you know, that in itself was very moving. Then the guards took us over to the old dining hall, the old prison where my dad had recorded the album. Oh, that was a moment out of time. It \u2014 I just can\u2019t tell you the feeling of that. It was \u2014 it was time travel. Hmm. I have to say I watched a little bit of it on YouTube and\u2026 There\u2019s some of it on YouTube? Yeah. It\u2019s just a snippet, but \u2014 but what I noticed, I mean, I saw how moving it was for you, what you\u2019re describing now, but they also would pan to the men\u2019s faces, you know. I mean, they were just soaking this up, right? Well, I was too, you know, and one guy said to me, he said, \u201CCould you ever imagine being in my place?\u201D And I said, \u201CMan, some days you have more internal freedom than I do.\u201D And it\u2019s so true, so true. We create our own prisons, don\u2019t we? Hmm. Wow. So I want to just end by just asking, you know, where \u2014 what you are thinking about now, where\u2019s the \u2014 where do you see the veil lifting in unexpected places now? I think about my children and how I\u2019m the middle of this ongoing story of my family. I\u2019m not the end of it. And I\u2019m interested in what they\u2019re going to do. One of them is a musician and one, you know, I still have a young child at home, my son, who\u2019s 12. And every single moment with this kid is precious to me, because there\u2019s no wall between me and my own mortality anymore. You know, both my parents are gone and I feel this urgency to complete the things I want to complete. And in the same way, I just feel like I\u2019ll never read all the books I want to read in this lifetime. I\u2019ll never complete all of the projects and write all the songs I want to write. So I started taking music theory again and piano lessons just so maybe it will be a doorway to go deeper into something. And I feel more excited about it than I did when I was 14. Hmm. I think that \u2014 that\u2019s your last word. Anything else \u2014 is there anything else? Well, a song. Yeah, a song. I\u2019m going to do \u201CThe World Unseen.\u201D This is also from \u201CBlack Cadillac\u201D, and the first line, \u201CI\u2019m the sparrow on the roof,\u201D is from the Psalms. And in the last few months of my dad\u2019s life, I read Psalms \u2014 the Psalms to him. And I don\u2019t think I ever realized how poetic the Psalms were. And then this line about being a sparrow on the roof just killed me. So after my dad died, I wanted to start the song that way. Rosanne Cash is a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter. Her new album is called \u201CThe River & the Thread,\u201D and she\u2019s the author of a few books, including Composed: A Memoir.
