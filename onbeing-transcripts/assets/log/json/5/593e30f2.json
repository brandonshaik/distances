  "fullText": "Mary Oliver is one of our greatest living poets, beloved and often quoted by people across ages and backgrounds. She\u2019s just released a new volume, Felicity, at the age of 80. And so this hour, we\u2019re revisiting the rare interview she granted us earlier this year on the world and poetry \u2014 and the life behind her writing. \u201CWhoever you are, no matter how lonely, / the world offers itself to your imagination, / calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting\u2014 / over and over announcing your place / in the family of things.\u201D Lord knows when I started writing poetry, it was rotten. The poetry was rotten? Sure. I was ten, eleven, twelve years old, but I kept at it \u2014 with my pencil I\u2019ve traveled to the moon and back. Probably a few times. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Mary Oliver was born in 1935 and grew up in a small town in Ohio. She\u2019s won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, among her many honors \u2014 and has previously published numerous collections of poetry and also some wonderful prose. She lived and wrote for five decades in Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, and her poetry is vivid with a sense of place. After an illness and the death of her longtime partner, the photographer Molly Malone Cook, Mary Oliver has now moved to southern Florida. And that\u2019s where I visited her. The question I always start with, whether I\u2019m interviewing a physicist or a poet is \u2014 I\u2019d like to hear whether there was a spiritual background to your life \u2014 to your early life, to your childhood. However you would define that now. Well, I would define it now very differently from when I was a child. I was sent to Sunday school, as many kids are. And then I had trouble with the resurrection. So I would not join the church. But I was still probably more interested than many of the kids who did enter the church. It\u2019s been one of the most important interests of my life and continues to be. And it doesn\u2019t have to be Christianity. I\u2019m very much taken with the poet Rumi\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026who is Muslim, a Sufi poet \u2014 and read him every day, and have no answers but have some suggestions. I know that a life is much richer with a spiritual part to it. Mm-hmm. And I also think nothing is more interesting. So I cling to it. Right. And then you talk about growing up in a sad, depressed place, a difficult place. In another \u2014 you don\u2019t belabor this, I mean, and in other places \u2014 there\u2019s a place you talk about you were one of many thousands who\u2019ve had insufficient childhoods. Yes. But that you spent a lot of your time walking around the woods. Yes. In Ohio. I did. And I think it saved my life. I \u2014 to this day, I don\u2019t care for the enclosure of buildings. Mm-hmm. It was a very bad childhood for everybody, every member of the household, not just myself I think. And I escaped it, barely. With years of trouble. Yeah. But I did find the entire world in looking for something. But I got saved by poetry. And I got saved by the beauty of the world. Yeah. And there\u2019s such a convergence of those things then \u2026 Yes. It seems all the way through. Yes. You \u2014 in your life as a poet. It is. It is a convergence. And I have a little difficulty now having lived for 50 years in a small town in the north. I\u2019m trying very hard to love the mangroves. Well, I know. It takes a while. And I have to say, you and your poetry, for me, are so closely identified with Provincetown and\u2026 Yes. \u2026and that part of the world, and that kind of dramatic weather \u2014 that kind of shore. Yes. And so when I had this amazing opportunity to come visit you \u2014 and I said, \u201COh great, we\u2019re going to Cape Cod!\u2026 No, we\u2019re going to Florida.\u201D Yes. Well, I just sold my condo to a very dear friend this summer. And I bought a little house down here, which is \u2014 needs very serious reconstruction. So, I\u2019m not in it yet. But sometimes it\u2019s time for the change. Yeah. Though, for all those years, for decades of your writing, this picture was there of you. This pleasure of walking and writing and, I don\u2019t know, standing with your notebook. Yes. And actually writing while you\u2019re walking. Yes. That\u2019s how I did it. And it is. And it seems like such a gift that you found that way to be a writer and to have that daily \u2014 have a ritual of writing. Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 as I say, I don\u2019t like buildings. Yeah. So I was \u2014 the only record I broke in school was truancy. I went to the woods a lot with books. Right. Whitman in the knapsack. But I also liked motion. So I just began with these little notebooks and scribbled things as I \u2014 they came to me. And then worked them into poems later. And always I wanted the \u201CI.\u201D Many of the poems are \u201CI did this. I did this. I saw this.\u201D I wanted them \u2014 the \u201CI\u201D to be the possible reader. Mm-hmm. Rather than about myself. It was about an experience that happened to be mine but could well have been anybody else\u2019s. And that was my feeling about the \u201CI.\u201D I have been criticized by one editor who felt that \u201CI\u201D would be felt as ego. And I thought, no, well, I\u2019m going to risk it and see. And I think it worked. It enjoined the reader into the experience of the poem. I became the kind of person who did the walking and the scribbling but shared it. Yeah. If they wanted it. Yes. And you also use this word \u2014 there\u2019s this place where you\u2019re talking about writing while walking, you know, listening deeply. And I love this, \u201Clistening convivially.\u201D Yes. Yeah. And listening, really, to the world. Listening to the world. Well, I did that, and I still do it. Mm-hmm. I still do it. I was going to ask you if you thought you could have been a poet in an age when you probably would have grown up writing on computers. Oh. Oh, now? Oh, I very much advise writers not to use a computer. But it seems to me that more than the computer being the problem, the sitting at a desk would be a problem. That\u2019s a problem. Lots of things are problems. I always \u2014 as I talk about it in the Poetry Handbook, discipline is very important. Yes. The habit \u2014 I think we\u2019re creative all day long. And if \u2014 we have to have an appointment to have that work out on the page. Because the creative part of us gets tired of waiting, or just gets tired. And it\u2019s helped a lot of students, young poets, doing that. To have that meeting with that part of oneself because there are, of course, other parts of life. I used to say I gave my \u2014 when I had jobs, which wasn\u2019t that often, but I\u2019d say I give my very best second, second class labor to\u2026 \u2026to the job. \u2026to the job. Because I\u2019d get up at five, and by nine I\u2019d already had my say. Yeah. And also when you write about that \u2014 the discipline that creates space for something quite mysterious to happen. You talk about that \u201Cwild, silky part of ourselves.\u201D You talk about the \u201Cpart of the psyche that works in concert with consciousness and supplies a necessary part of the poem \u2014 a heart of the star as opposed to the shape of the star, let us say \u2014 exists in a mysterious, unmapped zone: not unconscious, not subconscious, but cautious.\u201D Where? What is that from? That\u2019s from the Poetry Handbook. It\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s great. But you say \u2014 you promise \u2014 it learns quickly what sort of courtship it\u2019s going to be. You\u2019re saying that the writer has to be kind of in courtship with this\u2026 Yes. \u2026elusive \u2014 essential, but elusive, cautious, as you say, cautious part. And that if you turn up every day, it will learn to trust you. Yes, yes, yes. I remember that. This is a very practical way about talking about something that\u2019s quite\u2026 That trust is very important. Yes. Yeah. And that\u2019s the creative process. That is the creative process. It\u2019s also true that I believe poetry \u2014 it is a convivial and kind of, I mean, it\u2019s very old. It\u2019s very sacred. It\u2019s very \u2014 wishes for a community. It\u2019s a community ritual, certainly. And that\u2019s why, when you write a poem, you write it for anybody and everybody. Yeah. And you have to be ready to do that out of your single self. It\u2019s a giving. It\u2019s always \u2014 it\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s a gift to yourself but it\u2019s a gift to anybody who has a hunger for it. Right. And I wonder if it\u2019s something about this process you describe where you\u2019ve applied the will, but also the discipline, to reach and also make room for something that\u2019s very deep in us. Right? I mean, I love this language, \u201Cthis wild, silky part of ourselves.\u201D I don\u2019t know, maybe the soul. It\u2019s become a nasty word lately\u2026 I know it has. \u2026because it\u2019s used \u2014 it\u2019s become a lazy word. Yeah. It\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s cliched. Yeah. Overused. Yeah, the silky part, let\u2019s just call it that. But I mean, so if you \u2014 when you offer that, poetry does create a way to offer that in a condensed\u2026 Yes. \u2026form, vivid form. And very often it \u2014 it was Blake who said, \u201CI take dictation.\u201D Yeah. With that discipline and with that willingness and wish to communicate, very often things very slippery do come in that you weren\u2019t planning on receiving them. Right. But they do happen. It does \u2014 I have very rarely, maybe four or five times in my life, I\u2019ve written a poem that I never changed. And I don\u2019t know where it came from. But it does happen. But it happens among hundreds of poems that you\u2019ve struggled over. But it\u2019s \u2026 Yeah. Do you know which \u2014 do you know what some of those are? Do you know what they are still? Well, the Percy one was one. Oh, OK. \u201CThe First Time Percy Came Back.\u201D Yeah. I never changed a word of that. And there are others. I can\u2019t remember, but there are a few. Of course, there are also poems that I just write out and then I throw them out. Right. Lots of those. Well, and also, when you talk about this life of waking up in the morning and being outside in this wild landscape with your notebook in your hand and walking. It\u2019s so enviable, right? But then I know, when you\u2019re in the Poetry Handbook, there\u2019s the discipline of being there, but there\u2019s also the hard work of rewriting. And, as you say, some things have to be thrown out. Oh many, many, many have to be thrown out. For sure. There\u2019s an un-romantic part to the process as well. Well, that\u2019s an interesting word. Somebody once wrote about me and said I must have a private grant or something that all I seem to do is walk around the woods and write poems. But I was very, very poor. Mm-hmm. And I found \u2014 I ate a lot of fish, I ate a lot of clams. Right. And I realized that you actually \u2014 you weren\u2019t just walking around the woods, you were gathering food\u2026 Yes. Yes. \u2026in those early years: mussels and clams and mushrooms and berries. Although you gave voice to this kind of really lavish, even ornate beauty that you lived in that was your daily\u2026 That\u2019s how I saw it. \u2026that was really your mundane world. Yes, that\u2019s true. So there\u2019s a question that you pose in many different ways, overtly and implicitly, you know, \u201CHow shall I live?\u201D In Long Life you wrote, \u201CWhat does it mean that the earth is so beautiful? And what shall I do about it? What is the gift that I should bring to the world? What is the life that I should live?\u201D Which really is a question of moral imagination. Yes. Yeah. And it\u2019s the ancient essential question. But I wonder how you think about how that question emerges and is addressed distinctively in poetry and through poetry. What does poetry do with a question like that, that other forms of language don\u2019t? Well, I think I would disagree that other forms of language don\u2019t. But poetry has a different kind of attraction. Yeah. So what is that attraction in poetry? I think it\u2019s the way it\u2019s written. It\u2019s the fact that it has been communal for years and years and years and we\u2019ve missed it. But I do think poetry has enticements of sound that are different from literature. Literature certainly has it too, or some literature, the best literature. And it has \u2014 it\u2019s easier for people to remember. People are more apt to remember a poem and therefore feel they own it\u2026 Right. \u2026and can speak it to themselves as you might a prayer than they can remember a chapter and quote it. And that\u2019s very important because then it belongs to you. You have it when you need it. But poetry is certainly closer to singing than prose. Right. Right. And singing is something that we all love to do or wish we could do. It \u2026 And it goes all the way through you. Yes. It does indeed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today in a rare conversation with the poet Mary Oliver. I just wanted to read \u2014 I just love \u2014 I just want to read these. This is from Long Life also. \u201CThe world is: fun, and familiar, and healthful, and unbelievably refreshing, and lovely. And it is the theater of the spiritual; it is the multiform utterly obedient to a mystery.\u201D Yeah. Well, you know, and it is. We all wonder, \u201CWho is God? What\u2019s going to happen when we die?\u201D All that stuff. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 maybe \u2014 it\u2019s never nothing. I\u2019m very fond of Lucretius. Say some more. And Lucretius says just everything\u2019s a little energy. You go back and you\u2019re these little bits of energy and pretty soon you\u2019re something else. Now that\u2019s a continuance. It\u2019s not the one we think of when we\u2019re talking about the golden streets and the angels with how many wings and whatever, the hierarchy of angels. Even angels have a hierarchy. But it\u2019s something quite wonderful. The world is pretty much \u2014 everything is mortal. It dies. But its parts don\u2019t die. Its parts become something else. And we know that when we bury a dog in the garden. And with a rose bush on top of it. We know that there is replenishment. And that\u2019s pretty amazing. Mm-hmm. And what more there might be, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m pretty confident of that one. And, I mean, again, do you think spending your life as a poet and working with words and responding to the world in the way you have as a poet gives you, I don\u2019t know, tools to work with? Because putting words around God, or what God is, or who God is, or, I don\u2019t know, heaven \u2014 it\u2019s always insufficient. It\u2019s always insufficient, but the question and the wonder is not unsatisfying. It\u2019s never totally satisfying. But it\u2019s intriguing. And also what one does end up believing, even if it shifts, has an effect upon the life that you live, the life that you choose to live or try to live. So it\u2019s an endless, unanswerable quest. So I find it endlessly fascinating. And I think also religion is very helpful in people not thinking that they themselves are sufficient. That there is something that has to do with all of us that is more than all of us are. And I think, you know, that is what you do because of the particular vision that you have, what you pay attention to, what you attend to, which is that grandeur, that largeness of the natural world, which \u2014 you know, a couple of years ago when I was writing, and I picked up your book A Thousand Mornings. And here\u2019s the first one, \u201CI Go Down to the Shore\u201D: \u201CI go down to the shore in the morning / and depending on the hour the waves / are rolling in or moving out, / and I say, oh, I am miserable, / what shall\u2014 / what should I do? And the sea says / in its lovely voice: / Excuse me, I have work to do.\u201D I love that. I love that. And I have to say also, to me, it was just \u2014 it\u2019s so perfect. It kind of was, like, what\u2019s the point of writing 50,000 \u2014 bringing 50,000 new words into the world? This says it all. Well, I have had a rash, which seems to be continuing, of writing shorter poems. I noticed that in your more recent poems. And it probably is an influence from Rumi, whose poems are \u2014 many of them are quite short. But if you can say it in a few lines, you\u2019re just decorating for the rest of it. Unless you could \u2014 intent makes something more intense, but if you said what you want to say, you\u2019re not going to make it more intense. You\u2019re just going to repeat yourself. So I\u2019ve got a poem that will start the next book. I think it goes like this: \u201CThings take the time they take. Don\u2019t\u2014 / worry. / How many roads did St. Augustine follow / before he became St. Augustine?\u201D Same kind of thing. What else is there to say? That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s four lines, and that\u2019s not a day\u2019s work. But the poem is done. And it speaks so completely perfectly to the \u201CI\u201D who\u2019s reading the poem. Even though it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about St. Augustine, but it\u2019s about all of us. Right? Yeah, and people do worry that they\u2019re not wherever they want to go. And St. Augustine \u2014 I just read a biography of him. And he was all over the map before he settled down. Yeah. I\u2019d like to talk about attention, which is another real theme that runs through your work \u2014 both the word and the practice. And I know people associate you with that word. But I was interested to read that you began to learn that attention without feeling is only a report. That there is more to attention than \u2014 for it to matter in the way you want it to matter. Say something about that learning. You need empathy with it rather than just reporting. Reporting is for field guides. And they\u2019re great. They\u2019re helpful. But that\u2019s what they are. But they\u2019re not thought provokers. And they don\u2019t go anywhere. And I say somewhere that attention is the beginning of devotion, which I do believe. But that\u2019s it. A lot of these things are said but can\u2019t be explained. I think that your poem \u201CA Summer Day\u201D is maybe, is one of the best known. Yes it is. I would say that\u2019s true. Yeah. So, my daughter, who is now 21 and all grown up, but who then was about 12, was assigned to memorize \u201CA Summer Day.\u201D \u201CThe Summer Day.\u201D \u201CThe Summer Day.\u201D \u201CThe Summer Day\u201D in sixth grade. And so she came home reciting this poem and I felt really embodying it. And we actually played it in the show. Anyway, I brought it because I wanted you to hear it. And so remember, she\u2019s not reading it, she\u2019d learned it. \u201CThe Summer Day\u201D: \u201CWho made the world?\u2028 / Who made the swan, and the black bear? / \u2028Who made the grasshopper?\u2028 / This grasshopper, I mean\u2014 / \u2028the one who has flung herself out of the grass,\u2028 / the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,\u2028 / who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down\u2014 / who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.\u2028 / Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.\u2028 / Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.\u2028 / I don\u2019t know exactly what a prayer is. / \u2028I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down / \u2028into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,\u2028 / how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,\u2028 / which is what I have been doing all day.\u2028 / Tell me, what else should I have done?\u2028 / doesn\u2019t everything die at last, and too soon?\u2028 / Tell me, what is it you plan to do\u2028 / with your one wild and precious life?\u201D That\u2019s a beautiful reading. Is that fun for you to hear? Yeah. How old was she then? She was about 12. Yeah. Beautiful. But so many, so many young people, I mean, young and old, have learned that poem by heart. And it\u2019s become part of them. Yeah. One thing about that poem, which I think is important, is that the grasshopper actually existed. And yet I was able to fit him into that poem. And the sugar he was eating was part of frosting from a Portuguese lady\u2019s birthday cake, which wasn\u2019t important to the poem. But even seeing that little creature come to my plate and say, I\u2019d like a little helping of that. It somehow fascinates me that \u2014 that\u2019s just personal for me that it was Mrs. Segura, probably her 90th birthday cake or something. Did she ever read the poem? Did she ever know? No. She was past that. Her daughters may have, but I never advertised myself as a poet. And there was that wonderful thing about the town. And that is, I was taken as somebody who worked like anybody else. And I\u2019d go \u2014 there was one fellow who was the plumber. And we\u2019d maybe meet in the hardware store in the morning. You mean in Provincetown? And he\u2019d say, \u201COh, hi, Mary. How\u2019s your work going?\u201D And I\u2019d say, \u201CPretty good. How was yours?\u201D And it was the same thing. There was no sense of eliteness or difference, and that was very nice. It was just \u2014 in fact, it is a funny story. When I \u2014 the Pulitzer Prize was announced, which I didn\u2019t even know they\u2019d turned the book in for \u2014 I was, at that time, as the whole town was doing, going out to the dump most mornings, which was a mess \u2014 that was before they cleaned up \u2014 to buy shingles. I was shingling the house or some kind of thing. And a friend of mine came by \u2014 a woman who\u2019s a painter. She said, \u201CHa, what are you doing? Looking for your old manuscripts?\u201D It was very funny. And you didn\u2019t know? She\u2019d heard the news? I knew. But my job in the morning was to go find some shingles. You can listen again and share this conversation with Mary Oliver through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. The great poet Mary Oliver has just turned 80. On the occasion of her newest book, Felicity, we\u2019re revisiting the rare interview she granted us earlier this year on the world and poetry \u2014 and the life behind her writing. She\u2019s won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize among her many honors, and is beloved by people across ages and backgrounds. She\u2019s moved from Cape Cod to Florida to be close to friends, and that\u2019s where we visited her. I wanted to also name the fact that, as you said before, you\u2019re not somebody who belabors what is dark, what has been hard. I think it\u2019s important and maybe helpful for people, because there\u2019s so much beauty and light in your poetry, also that you let in the fact that it\u2019s not all sweetness and light. And you did that a lot in the Dream Workbook. I did. I did. And those poems are notably harder. And a lot of \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t know at that time what I was writing about. I really had no understanding. You mean, you didn\u2019t realize that they were so hard, or you literally didn\u2019t know what you were\u2026 No \u2014 there\u2019s a poem called \u201CRage.\u201D Yes. And I \u2014 it\u2019s a she. Yeah. And that was \u2014 that\u2019s perfect biography, unfortunately. Or autobiography. But I couldn\u2019t handle that material except in the three or four poems that I\u2019ve done. Just couldn\u2019t. Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s a line in \u201CRage\u201D: \u201Cin your dreams you have sullied and murdered, / and your dreams do not lie.\u201D And that\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s how I felt, but I didn\u2019t know I was \u2014 certainly, I didn\u2019t know I was talking about my father. Children forget. I mean, they don\u2019t forget, but they forget the details. They just don\u2019t know why they have nightmares all the time. It\u2019s very difficult. Isn\u2019t it incredible that we carry those things all our lives, decades and decades and decades? Well, we do carry it. But it is very helpful to figure out, as best you can, what happened and why these people were the way they were. Yeah. It was a very dark and broken house that I came from. I mean, there\u2019s another \u2014 there\u2019s that poem in there, \u201CA Visitor,\u201D which mentions your father. And there\u2019s just, to me, this heartbreaking line, which also \u2014 I have my own story. We all do. \u201CI saw what love might have done / had we loved in time\u2026\u201D \u201C\u2026had we loved in time.\u201D Yeah. Well, he never got any love out of me. Yeah. Or deserved it. But mostly what makes you angry is the loss of the years of your life. Because it does leave damage. But there you are. You do what you can do. And I think the \u2014 you have such a capacity for joy especially in the outdoors. Right? And you transmit that. And it\u2019s that joy. If you\u2019re capable of that, how much more \u2014 how much more of it would there have been? Well, I saved my own life by finding a place that wasn\u2019t in that house. And that was my strength. But I wasn\u2019t all strength. And it would have been a very different life. Whether I would have written poetry or not, who knows? Poetry is a pretty lonely pursuit. And, in many cases I used to think, I don\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 but that I\u2019m talking to myself. There was nobody else that in that house I was going to talk to. And it was a very difficult time, and a long time. And I don\u2019t understand some people\u2019s behavior. But I \u2014 and I guess what I\u2019m saying, I think, is that it\u2019s a gift that you give to your readers to let that be clear. That this, you know, that your ability to love your wild, your \u201Cone wild and precious life\u201D is hard won. Yeah. And, I mean \u2014 I feel like you also, for all the glorious language about God and around God that goes all the way through your poetry, you also acknowledge this perplexing thing. I mean, this was in Long Life: \u201CWhat can we do about God, who makes and then breaks every god-forsaken, beautiful day?\u201D Well, we can go back and read Lucretius. What does Lucretius do then? Lucretius just presents this marvelous and important idea that what we are made of will make something else. Which to me is very important. There is no nothingness. With these little atoms that run around too little for us to see, but put together they make something. And that to me is a miracle. Where it came from, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a miracle. And I think it\u2019s enough to keep a person afloat. Let\u2019s talk about your last couple of books. Which also are an insight into you at this stage in your life. And then I\u2019d love for you to read some poems. OK. You have said that you were so captivated. That you were \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said this that way, but it seems to me you\u2019ve kind of written about being so captivated by the world of nature that you were less open to the world of humans. Yes. And that as you\u2019ve grown older, as you\u2019ve gone through life, what did you say \u2014 you\u2019ve entered more fully into the human world and embraced it. Is that a good? Is that a \u2026 True. It\u2019s absolutely true. And was it passage of time? It was passage of time. It was a passage of understanding what happened to me and why I behaved in certain ways and didn\u2019t in other ways. So it was clarity. You wrote really beautifully about the death of Molly, who you shared so much of your life with. And you wrote, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m finding my notes, \u201CThe end of life has its own nature, also worth our attention.\u201D Yeah. I liked that line. And in some ways, it feels to me, when I read your poetry of the last couple of years, that that\u2019s really this territory you\u2019re on, or at least part of it. Well, I should be. And I don\u2019t mean \u2014 I don\u2019t mean you\u2019re at the end of life, but just paying attention to \u2026 Well, I\u2019ve been better. But just a different \u2014 it\u2019s a different chapter. Well, it is. I mean, I had cancer a couple years ago. Right. Lung cancer. And it feels that death has left his calling card. I\u2019m fine. I get scanned, you know, as they do. I\u2019m lucky. I\u2019m very lucky. But all the same, you\u2019re kind of shocked. This doctor, that doctor. I\u2019m a bad smoker \u2026 And you\u2019re still smoking. Yeah. And last time the doctor said, \u201CYour lungs are good.\u201D You get good fortune, take it. And you keep smoking. There\u2019s that poem, \u201CThe Fourth Sign of the Zodiac\u201D in the new book. Yeah. How does that start? Which one is that? Oh, I \u2014 that\u2019s one of the poems about cancer. Well, right. And you haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t think \u2014 have you spoken much about your cancer? I don\u2019t \u2026 No. People know that you were ill \u2026 People knew I was ill and they didn\u2019t know\u2026 \u2026they didn\u2019t know what it was. In that poem, there\u2019s a very passing reference to it. Oh, yes there is. There are four poems. One is about the hunter in the woods that makes no sound. All the hunters. It\u2019s a little bit long, but do you want to read it? Sure. OK. Oh, where\u2019d I put my glasses? There they are. Yeah. The fourth sign of the zodiac is, of course, cancer. Oh, that\u2019s what I meant. \u201CWhy should I have been surprised? / Hunters walk the forest / without a sound. / The hunter, strapped to his rifle, / the fox on his feet of silk, / the serpent on his empire of muscles\u2014 / all move in a stillness, / hungry, careful, intent. / Just as the cancer / entered the forest of my body, / without a sound.\u201D Yeah. These four poems are about the cancer episode, shall we say? The cancer visit? Did you want me to go on to these others? Yeah. You want to go on? Is it too much? No. This is the second poem of these four: \u201CThe question is, / what will it be like / after the last day? / Will I float / into the sky / or will I fray / within the earth or a river\u2014 / remembering nothing? / How desperate I would be / if I couldn\u2019t remember / the sun rising, if I couldn\u2019t / remember trees, rivers; if I couldn\u2019t / even remember, beloved, / your beloved name. 3. / I know, you never intended to be in this world. / But you\u2019re in it all the same. / So why not get started immediately. / I mean, belonging to it. / There is so much to admire, to weep over. / And to write music or poems about. / Bless the feet that take you to and fro. / Bless the eyes and the listening ears. / Bless the tongue, the marvel of taste. / Bless touching. / You could live a hundred years, it\u2019s happened. / Or not. / I am speaking from the fortunate platform / of many years, / none of which, I think, I ever wasted. / Do you need a prod? / Do you need a little darkness to get you going? / Let me be as urgent as a knife, then, / and remind you of Keats, / so single of purpose and thinking, for a while, / he had a lifetime. 4. / Late yesterday afternoon, in the heat, / all the fragile blue flowers in bloom / in the shrubs in the yard next door had / tumbled from the shrubs and lay / wrinkled and faded on the grass. But / this morning the shrubs were full of / the blue flowers again. There wasn\u2019t / a single one on the grass. How, I / wondered, did they roll or crawl back to / the shrubs and then back up to / the branches, that fiercely wanting, / as we all do, just a little more of / life?\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with the beloved poet Mary Oliver. There are some of your poems, and I think \u201CThe Summer Day\u201D is one and \u201CWild Geese\u201D is another, that are just \u2014 that have just entered the lexicon. Yes. That \u2014 three: \u201CThe Summer Day,\u201D \u201CWild Geese,\u201D there\u2019s one other I can\u2019t remember, but I would say is the third one. But I don\u2019t remember it. If you think of it, tell me. So, \u201CWild Geese\u201D is in Dream Work. Is that a poem \u2014 and I\u2019ve heard people talk about that, \u201CWild Geese,\u201D as a poem that has saved lives. And I wonder if, when you write something like that \u2014 I mean, when you wrote that poem, or when you published this book, would you have known that that was the poem that would speak so deeply to people? This is the magic of it. That poem was written as an exercise in end-stopped lines. As an exercise in what? End-stopped lines. Period at the end of the line. I was working with a poet. I had her in a class. So it was an exercise in technique. Yes. Yes. And not every line is that way. I was trying to show the variation, but my mind was completely on that. At the same time, I will say that I heard the wild geese. I mean, I just started out to do this for this friend and show her the effect of the line end is \u2014 you\u2019ve said something definite. It\u2019s very different from enjambment. And I love all that difference. And that\u2019s what I was doing. To your point that the mystery is in that combination of discipline and the convivial listening. Yeah. I was trying to do a certain kind of construction. Nevertheless, once I started writing the poem, it was the poem. And I knew the construction well enough that I didn\u2019t have to think about \u2014 if I need an end-stopped line here or \u2026 It just worked itself out the way I wanted for the exercise. Would you read that one? Sure. That\u2019s kind of a secret. But it\u2019s the truth. \u201CWild Geese.\u201D I actually thought it was \u2014 oh no, there it is. Fourteen, you\u2019re right. \u201CWild Geese\u201D: \u201CYou do not have to be good. / You do not have to walk on your knees / for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. / You only have to let the soft animal of your body / love what it loves. / Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. / Meanwhile the world goes on. / Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain / are moving across the landscapes, / over the prairies and the deep trees, / the mountains and the rivers. / Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, / are heading home again. / Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, / the world offers itself to your imagination, / calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting\u2014 / over and over announcing your place / in the family of things.\u201D Well, it\u2019s a subject I knew, well, a lot about, you know? So it \u2026 It was just there in you. It what? It was there in you to come out. It was there in me. Yes. Once I heard those geese, and said that line about anguish \u2014 and where that came from, I don\u2019t know. Yeah. I\u2019d say that\u2019s one of the poems that\u2026 \u2026that just came. Yeah. It wasn\u2019t dictated, but \u2014 that\u2019s what Blake used to say. Yeah. And that\u2019s just a way of saying you don\u2019t know where it comes from. Yeah. But if you\u2019ve done it \u2014 if you\u2019ve done it lot \u2014 and lord knows when I started writing poetry, it was rotten. The poetry was rotten? Sure. I was 10, 11, 12 years old, but I kept at it, kept at it, kept at it. I used to say I \u2014 with my pencil I\u2019ve traveled to the moon and back. Probably a few times. I kept at it every day. And finally you learn things. I\u2019m conscious that I want to move towards a close. I\u2019d like to hear a little bit more \u2014 you\u2019ve mentioned Rumi a few times. In A Thousand Mornings, you say, \u201CIf I were a Sufi for sure I would be one of the spinning kind.\u201D And that\u2019s clear. I mean, actually, it makes so much sense from how you were always on the move even as a teenager. How do you think your spiritual sensibility \u2014 and here we are again with that tricky word. But how is your spiritual \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say how is your spiritual life. I mean, you\u2019ve said somewhere you\u2019ve become more spiritual as you\u2019ve grown older. And, I mean, what do you mean when you say that? What\u2019s the content of that? I\u2019ve become kinder, more people-oriented, more willing to grow old. I always was investigative in terms of everlasting life, but a little more interested now. A little more content with my answers. There\u2019s this poem. The second poem in A Thousand Mornings, which is your 2013 book, which also, to me, just kind of says it all. What\u2019s the point of the \u2014 \u201CI Happen to Be Standing.\u201D Would you read that one? Oh. Yeah. It\u2019s just, there it is. Yeah. \u201CI don\u2019t know where prayers go, / or what they do. / Do cats pray, while they sleep / half-asleep in the sun? / Does the opossum pray as it / crosses the street? / The sunflowers? The old black oak / growing older every year? / I know I can walk through the world, / along the shore or under the trees, / with my mind filled with things / of little importance, in full / self-attendance. A condition I can\u2019t really / call being alive. / Is a prayer a gift, or a petition, / or does it matter? / The sunflowers blaze, maybe that\u2019s their way. / Maybe the cats are sound asleep. Maybe not. / While I was thinking this I happened to be standing / just outside my door, with my notebook open, / which is the way I begin every morning. / Then a wren in the privet began to sing. / He was positively drenched in enthusiasm, / I don\u2019t know why. And yet, why not. / I wouldn\u2019t persuade you from whatever you believe / or whatever you don\u2019t. That\u2019s your business. / But I thought, of the wren\u2019s singing, what could this be / if it isn\u2019t a prayer? / So I just listened, my pen in the air.\u201D Well, the poems keep coming. In the Poetry Handbook you wrote, \u201CPoetry is a life-cherishing force. And it requires a vision \u2014 a faith to use an old-fashioned term. Yes, indeed. For poems are not words, after all, but fires for the cold, ropes let down to the lost, something as necessary as bread in the pockets of the hungry. Yes, indeed.\u201D And I just wanted to read that back to you because I feel like you\u2019ve given that to so many people. You\u2019ve demonstrated that. And, you know, you also write in poetry about thinking of Schubert scribbling on a cafe napkin, \u201CThank you. Thank you.\u201D Yes. Yes. And I feel like so many people when they read \u2014 when they imagine you standing outdoors with your notebook and pen in hand, you know, \u201CThank you, thank you.\u201D You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s been a beautiful conversation. You\u2019re much welcome. I\u2019m free. I\u2019m free. Yes, you are! Mary Oliver has received the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. She has published over 25 books of poetry and prose, including Dream Work, A Thousand Mornings and A Poetry Handbook. Her new book of poetry is called Felicity. As you heard, she read the opening poem to that book, \u201CDon\u2019t Worry,\u201D in this conversation. You can listen to it again, along with the other poems you just heard and a few more she read for us, at onbeing.org. You may know that we usually post the unedited interview behind each week\u2019s episode. This 90 minutes with Mary Oliver contains many lovely moments, including more of her ruminations on her move from the landscape of Cape Cod to that of Florida; and on her long love of the dogs in her life. Have your dogs and your love of your dogs and life with dogs infused your theology? Or is that too lofty a question? Well, Rilke wrote a poem \u2014 some friend of mine did a painting of it, of just a picture of a dog. And the quote is, \u201CThe soul for which there is no heaven.\u201D Well, no thank you. I mean, there are going to be trees in paradise, as we\u2019re going to have fun imagining it, whether it exists or not. Dogs are certainly going to be there. Poor little burros and donkeys, after all the work they\u2019ve done in the world. Good heavens, yes. Right."
