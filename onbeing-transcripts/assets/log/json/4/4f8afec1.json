  "fullText": "This is what I want everyone to experience at the end of my concert is everyone has this sense of rejoicing. I don\u2019t want them to be blown away by what I do, I want them to have this sense of real, real joy from the depths of their being. Because I think when you take them to that place then you open up a place where grace can come in. Who better to contemplate the human voice \u2014 its delights, its revelations, and its mystery \u2014 than Bobby McFerrin? He\u2019s won 10 Grammys and is as comfortable with Chick Corea as with Mozart. He\u2019s also known for drawing thousands of strangers into singing the Ave Maria, beautifully, to their own deep surprise. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. I sat down with Bobby McFerrin at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis in 2011 and experienced the reflective side of this famously hyperkinetic performer. So, where I want to start is where I\u2019d start with everybody: I just want to hear about the religious or spiritual background of your childhood. Was there one? Mm-hmm. I attended an Episcopal church in Los Angeles. I sang in the children\u2019s choir. I was an alter boy. I loved the service. I loved the music. We had a wonderful choir director. Did you have an Anglican boys\u2019 choir? It wasn\u2019t a boys\u2019 choir no. It was a children\u2019s choir. Yeah. Around the age of 16, I remember that I thought that I wanted to join a monastic order, and I thought about that for maybe a couple of years. And then I thought about the priesthood when I was about 24. But music had always been apart of my life and singing, at 27, just took over, so \u2026 The monastic impulse \u2026 Mm-hmm. Where \u2014 what was that about? My love of quiet, you know, that was a big part of it. And I also liked the \u2014 I think the discipline of the hours. You know you get up early in the morning. You have a service and a few hours later, around 9:00, you have a service. And then at noon you stop \u2026 It\u2019s a rhythm of life. There\u2019s a rhythm \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 to the day. Mm-hmm. I like the fact that you stopped whatever you were doing at a particular time and you reminded yourself, you brought yourself back to your calling \u2014 you brought yourself back to, you know, the voice of God as well as you could, you know, and \u2014 and I really thought that I wanted to share that life. That\u2019s really interesting, and, I mean, I know there was a musical background to your childhood. Yeah. Your family is musical. I was curious, I mean, your father was an opera singer. Mm-hmm. And a great opera singer. I did also read that he liked to sing the spirituals. Oh, and he did a fabulous job. I haven\u2019t heard anyone sing the spirituals as well as my father. He really knew how to find the dirt and the bones in the tunes. So I work with the human voice in radio. Yeah. I mean I do a lot of my interviews just by ISDN, where all I\u2019m working with is the voice. Mm-hmm. And people in radio often say that radio is also the most visual medium. And I think of you as a kind of an explorer, you know, on many frontiers of the voice. How do you think about what the human voice alone can convey? Is that something you ponder in that way? I do. I\u2019ve thought about that many times. One of the reasons that I enjoy singing songs without words is because it allows the individual hearer to bring their own story to the sounds that I make. Now I love songs with words. There are some absolutely fabulous lyricists in the world. And I wish that I had the talent to \u2014 to convey an emotion or a feeling to someone with the right nuance, you know, using words. But somehow I\u2019ve gotten into conveying emotions through simply sounds because it affords me the opportunity to \u2014 to sort of have almost an individual meeting, you know, like you and I just speaking together just the two of us. Mm-hmm. If I say, for example, \u201COh I love you so much, you know, blah, blah blah,\u201D then everyone has the same experience. But if I say (singing melody) then everybody has a different experience. They have you know \u2014 to you, I mean, what did that convey? They have the experience that arises in their imagination and their memory. Yeah. Mm-hmm. The other thing though is you\u2019re working with the voice but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s actually your body, right, that\u2019s the instrument. Yeah. I mean to say that it\u2019s just the voice, in fact, is not quite big enough. No. I \u2014 I get what you\u2019re saying. You have to take care of yourself I think to sing well or to be a conveyor of song, to catch songs. I like to think of myself as a person who catches pieces. You know that the songs are out here, and they\u2019re just simply waiting for me to reach out for one and grab it and pull it down and have it come out of my mouth. I don\u2019t know if you can answer this question, but a question that rises in my mind is when you are singing when you are making your music \u2014 singing is not really \u2026 it\u2019s a little too small of word also \u2014 what does it feel like to be in your skin? Um, I\u2019m very relaxed on stage. The stage is my second home. The stage is a platform for adventure and I\u2019m ready for anything that happens to come up. I feel safe. I feel rested. I feel full of potential and opportunity. I feel great. I feel really good that I get to do \u2014 I get to use my gift. That\u2019s very gratifying, you know? Mm-hmm. I feel \u2014 my father was a humble man. He was a fabulous singer, but he was very, very humble. And he use to say, you know, \u201CGod\u2019s given me this gift; he\u2019s entrusted me with a talent,\u201D is what he use to say, \u201Cand it\u2019s my job to take care of it.\u201D And those words have stuck with me, you know. I feel like that I\u2019ve been entrusted with a talent; it\u2019s my job to take care of it, to do my best, to give the audience my best. And by best, it means I\u2019m myself; I\u2019m as close to myself as possible. I\u2019m as close to my genuine self. When I do workshops with students, we talk a lot about performance because they all want to perform. And I tell them to do their best \u2014 not to perform, simply be themselves: the same voice, the same self that they are when they are simply walking from class to class or standing in, you know, line waiting to get on the bus or whatever. It\u2019s extremely difficult to do because when you are on stage in front of a lot of people who are looking at you \u2014 and you are aware of them, you know, looking at you and thinking about you and listening to you \u2014 it\u2019s difficult not to perform or to do something that\u2019s safe and easy. And I tell them that the best way to be genuine and to get their point across is to be as relaxed and as easygoing about the whole \u2026 Yeah, but as you say it\u2019s kind of a paradox of the human condition. And in some ways, that\u2019s what we all work to do all of our lives is just to be ourselves and\u2026 Yeah, to be ourselves to be childlike. You know, Picasso said something about \u2014 said something like, you know, he spent his entire career learning how to paint like a child again or something like that. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s very, very difficult. Mm-hmm. It seems to me in some ways that the trajectory of your career, I mean, you\u2019ve done a lot of things \u2014 you do a lot of different kinds of music. You do conduct orchestras with classical music. Yeah. But in some ways, just bouncing off that phrase, you know, you\u2019ve moved from forms and settings, you\u2019ve kind of done the reverse of how we might talk about growing up. I mean you\u2019ve moved away from established forms and mature forms into improvisation and spontaneity or at least incorporated that into, uh, mastery \u2026 Hmm. \u2026 which, in a very simple way \u2014 in the way we talk about, you know, in the way we look about moving from childhood to adulthood or you know from being an amateur to a professional. In some ways you\u2019ve reversed the logic of that. In what \u2014 in what way do you mean? I mean, if we look at those things simplistically. You\u2019ve integrated more and more the kind of spontaneity, I mean, going back to what Picasso said that we know as children and that we lose \u2014 and that we lose as we\u2019re trained to be professionals, you know, not just as musicians, um \u2026 This is why I love improvisation and why I think it\u2019s important to teach children how to improvise \u2014 children of all ages to improvise. Right. Um, improvisation basically is simply motion. It precedes musical knowledge or understanding about anything. It\u2019s simply the act \u2014 the courageous act of opening up your mouth or putting your fingers on a keyboard or whatever \u2014 of opening your mouth and simply singing something and following it. Probably the best exercise I can think of is, you know, to tell my students to put on some kind of a timer set it for 10 minutes \u2014 open up their mouth and sing for 10 minutes, which is unbelievable how difficult that is to do for a lot of people \u2026 Right. \u2026 because somewhere within the first two minutes of this exercise, they are going to start talking to themselves and telling themselves how stupid this is and how dumb it is. And they start thinking about how, you know, whether they are singing in tune or not or how crazy they might be sounding and, \u201CI\u2019m glad that there\u2019s no one else around to listen to me sing because they\u2019d think I was crazy\u201D \u2014 and all that kind of stuff. And I tell them to fight all the tendencies to stop because you are going to want to. Two minutes into it, three minutes into it, eight minutes into it, you are going to want to stop. Your entire being, your body is going to be screaming, \u201CStop. Let me off of this,\u201D you know. Right. And I say no. Continue at 10 minutes and do it. Do it everyday for about three weeks and see what happens. It\u2019s simply motion, just the courage to keep moving just to keep going, you know. What gets in the way is, you know: Am I qualified to do this? Do I know enough to do this? Do I sound well enough to do this \u2014 or whatever, you know. There are all kinds of excuses for you not to do it. Improvisation, I think, is so essential to having a well-rounded musical life. If I was a teacher, you know, the kind that sits in a room with a student and you know they are learning how to play piano for the first time, before I even showed them a note on the staff I would say, \u201COK, let\u2019s just \u2014 lets just improvise, let\u2019s just sit down at the piano and just make up songs.\u201D Mm-hmm. And we\u2019d do that for a week of two, and then I\u2019d show the middle C on the staff and say, \u201COK, this is a middle C. We\u2019re going to improvise on this one note, just this,\u201D you know, and we\u2019ll just (makes sound) whatever they want to do play that. Mm-hmm. Then maybe after a couple days of that, I\u2019ll introduce D and we\u2019ll improvise on C and D and go back and forth, you know. We\u2019ll play around with that for a while, and I\u2019ll just gradually introduce different elements of music. But it all starts from improvisation. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with a master of vocal improvisation, Bobby McFerrin. I want to ask you about one of the most overtly religious songs you\u2019ve done, which was a song \u2014 the \u2014 when you set the Psalm 23 to music and you dedicated it to you mother. I did. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of music. I know \u2026 Thank you. I know it means a lot. I know it\u2019s played often in religious settings and, um, and you played with the gender. You\u2019re right. Um, and I looked and looked for, uh, if you ever talked about that but I\u2019d love to hear the story of that song, of that setting. I have a group called Voicestra, uh, which is an improvisational group. And at one of the rehearsals, we got \u2014 we were rehearsing in a church. OK. And we got to talking about the heavy patriarchal element of, you know, religion and all that stuff. And at the time, one of my musical exercises was to write a piece of music first thing in the morning. So I would get up and before I would do anything else, I\u2019d go into my studio and I\u2019d write. And I guess because of this conversation that we had had, you know, at that rehearsal, I thought, well let me \u2014 let me write something with, you know, with the feminine gender. And I wanted to because when we think about God\u2019s love it should encompass, you know, the mother and father, you know, the feelings of a man, the feelings of a woman. They are different, you know. Mm-hmm. And so this song just seemed to come out. You know, the church that I grew up, we had all kinds chants that were, you know, chants that were sung by the choir. And this kind of reminded me of an Episcopal chant, you know, in that \u2026 Mm-hmm. Yeah. \u2026 Episcopal hymnbook. And I wrote the feminine because I just wanted to remind people that for a lot of people, you know, when they think of their fathers, some of them might not have had great relationships with their dads. And also mothers too, you know; some of them don\u2019t have great relationships with their mothers. But sometimes we forget just the feminine element in religious service. And I just wanted to bring that out. You work a lot \u2014 it seems to me, um, I mean that \u2014 that is an overtly \u2014 that is \u2014 those are religious words. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s from a religious context. You work a lot with religious language and religious musicality, and you\u2019ve done this \u2014 what did it start as an instant opera on the Tower of Babel \u2026 Tower of Babel, yeah. \u2026 of Babel, right, which became something called \u201CBobble\u201D \u2026 Right. \u2026 which you performed in 2010 in Moscow. I\u2019ve been really intrigued speaking with Muslims in recent years about the musicality of the Qur\u2019an. You know, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s not music but it has musicality. I know exactly what you mean. You know what I mean? Yes, I do indeed. And I hear that coming out in that. And, you know, you\u2019ve got Tibetan throat singing, I mean, other versions of that of the musicality that\u2019s at the heart of these traditions. A couple of things: One, my favorite book in the Bible is the Psalms. I go through the Psalms every month. I read \u2014 I read scripture constantly, but the Psalms is like the book that I go to most of the time because in it is conveyed every human emotion. And what that tells me is that God gets it. He gets us. He understands us perfectly because he, in his book, has included the emotional, roller coaster rides that all of us go through. He gets it all. He understands it all. He can take it. Those angry psalms, the cursing psalms. He can take it. He can take it. Right. He can take it. He says, \u201CI get you. I understand you. I love you,\u201D you know? I was in Italy once, sitting at a caf\u00E9 getting ready to get on my bus to catch my plane. And all of a sudden, out of the lobby, I heard one of the most incredible voices I think I\u2019d ever heard from this man singing, at the top of his lungs, the most beautiful song. And he was a musician. He had been there the night before with a band. I can\u2019t remember the band that he was with. And I said, \u201COh, you must come over and sit down.\u201D So he sat down and he had \u2014 we had breakfast together. And he began to tell me about his family. Now his family \u2014 he was part of this family that where their tradition was to sing through the Qur\u2019an. They sang through it, and they\u2019d been doing it, you know, for like 500 years or something like that. Right. Right. And I thought, singing through the Qur\u2019an. And he says, \u201COh, yes. We start at the beginning; we go to the end. We have all these scales, and they\u2019re all these sort of songs that are attached to certain verses and chapters or whatever.\u201D But they sing through it and he grew up in this tradition. Oh, my God, I thought, wow, what would that be like to just to sing through all the Psalms. And I\u2019ve attempted to get \u2014 to get through them. Right. Well, of course monks do that. Maybe that\u2019s something you are attracted to. They do, yeah. Right. Yeah. It could be. But I think that\u2019s really wonderful. I think that there\u2019s a lot of music in scripture, a lot of music. Mm-hmm. I do think that that whole question of music and the deep musicality that\u2019s sacred, right, that\u2019s there as you say in Christianity and Judaism, it\u2019s not always in the form of kind of straightforward singing. It\u2019s chanting or \u2014 right, it\u2019s throat singing or it\u2019s reciting. It\u2019s reciting. I was once given a book by a man who \u2014 and what\u2019s \u2014what\u2019s his name, um, it \u2014 it\u2019ll come to me. It\u2019ll come to me. In his library, he had \u2014 he collected hymnals. Mm-hmm. And, um, I was just thumbing through his library and I found this one little book called Spiritual Songs. And I opened it, and it was the words to hymns, but not the music. And he was telling me about the tradition in some churches where there\u2019s a song leader who sings a melody, and the choir would just simply respond by singing whatever the song leader would sing. Right. So you have that. And you also have the fact that some of these people have been singing these songs for so long that they didn\u2019t need to put the music in the hymnal because they \u2014 everybody knew. Right. Everyone knew the hymns, you know. OK. Turn to 176, hymn 176, ah, 176: The lord, (singing melody) whatever. Turn to 825: (singing melody) whatever. Everybody knew all the tunes, you know, so you have that on one hand, and then you also have the improvisational element where the song leader would sing, \u201COh, Lord, yeah, follow you with all my heart. Oh lord, I follow you with all my heart.\u201D You know they would just make it up on the spot. You\u2019re living in Philadelphia now, and I\u2019m just remembering a summer I spent in Philadelphia, in a \u2014 I think they were American Baptist \u2014 it was an African-American congregation in South Philadelphia. OK. And they just got together, I mean, before church started. I don\u2019t know what time church started \u2014 11:00 or 12:00 \u2014 but you sang, they sang for two or three hours. You got together you sang and you prayed and \u2014 yeah, you know, you know, absolutely. I attended \u2026 Just like that. I attended a church called Zion Baptist Church in Philadelphia for a little while. And the reason I don\u2019t go there often is because the services are all day long. Yeah, \u2019cause then there\u2019s lunch after church, right. They just stay in church all day long. And I have to admire that, you know, because you most definitely feel the spirit when you\u2019ve been surrounded by these people for so long. You can listen again, share and watch my conversation with Bobby McFerrin through our website, onbeing.org. Coming up, more of Bobby McFerrin\u2019s music and his thoughts \u2014 on why singing together is life-giving for people; also, music as a door to \u201Cembodied memory.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, my 2011 conversation at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis with a genre-bending vocal magician and conductor, Bobby McFerrin. I remember talking once to a charismatic sociologist \u2014 she was Catholic \u2026 A charismatic \u2026 She was charismatic and she studied \u2026 Oh, charismatic; oh, I see. She was charismatic Catholic and she studied charismatic Christian spirituality. And one of the things she was saying about why Pentecostal Christianity is growing so quickly, which it is all over the world, is because it brings back in this whole body, cathartic part of religious experience, which through most of human history has been at the heart of it. And I was actually thinking about this when I was listening to \u2014 to \u201CBobble.\u201D Mm-hmm. Because you heard that, you heard that this human, um, attempt to reach out to, grasp, immerse oneself in what is sacred, right, to touch that \u2014 to evoke that. And music is such an important way of getting there. Yeah. To me that\u2019s why the \u2014 the Psalms \u2014 I think it\u2019s not an accident that it\u2019s in the very center of the Bible. If you just open it up and you come to the song book. Yeah. You know, I\u2019ve been doing this for a long, long time, singing in front of people and having a great, great time. And, you know, it\u2019s one thing when someone says, \u201COh, man, how did you do that?\u201D You know, \u201CHow did you sing two notes at once?\u201D and how did you do, you know, technically blah, blah, blah. But I remember so well, you know, I \u2014 I\u2019m reminded why I do what I do. This is why I do what I do. At the end of concerts instead of doing an encore I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve decided to do question and answers, you know. So we turn on the house lights, and I get a chance to see my audience really for the first time. And, you know, let\u2019s just hang out. What do you want to talk about? What do you want to ask me? You know, and so I get all kinds of questions. And I remembered this wonderful woman standing up one day and she said, \u201CI feel so good.\u201D She says, \u201CYou made me feel so good.\u201D And to me that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the whole bottom line. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a musician, you know. And you know \u2014 and this is connected to what we\u2019re talking about I think. There are all these videos on YouTube of you teaching the pentatonic scale to a crowd full of people at World Science Festival. But it\u2019s \u2014 so when you perform and when you do something like that, you get people singing together. And there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s something completely elemental and life-giving about that, right? I mean, we don\u2019t do that in this culture very often. When you have the experience, you wonder why don\u2019t we do that, right? Why don\u2019t we? Why don\u2019t we sing more often \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 when we want to? This is Bobby McFerrin at that World Science Festival in 2009. He was on a panel with a group of neuroscientists, when he led the audience in an impromptu round of the pentatonic scale. Following the movement of his body, they saw and sang the notes. For me, the high points of my evenings is hearing 3,000 voices, you know, singing with me. You know it\u2019s all about getting them to remember who they are and what they can do. I mean, who hasn\u2019t had this fantasy: You go to a concert, you listen to this great band, you\u2019ve got a wonderful voice, you know, you hear the background singers singing and they are leaving out that one note that you love. And so you sing that third part, you know. You\u2019re sitting in your seat but you\u2019re still singing their part, and you wish were up on stage with them. Or who hasn\u2019t had the fantasy of, you know, you\u2019re attending a symphony orchestra, it\u2019s 8:00; it\u2019s 8:15; it\u2019s 8:30. The conductor hasn\u2019t showed up, you know. The orchestra personnel director walks out on stage and says, you know, the conductor can\u2019t make it is there anyone in the audience who knows tonight\u2019s program? Would they lead the orchestra, you know, through Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony? Who hasn\u2019t had that fantasy that all of a sudden you\u2019ve been given the opportunity to direct this great, you know, choir or orchestra or sing background vocals with a really great band? Everyone has had that fantasy, you know, so they want to do it. They\u2019re ready to go, you know. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s the karaoke \u2014 the impulse behind karaoke. If I ask you, you know, if you think about \u2014 what does \u2014 what does that teach you? What do you take from that about \u2014 like what \u2014 what makes us human or the nature of God? Because there is something \u2014 if for \u2014 it\u2019s rare but it\u2019s also completely essential, this singing together. Singing together, it\u2019s essential for me, because I grew up in a house full of singers. Mm-hmm. There was singing in my house going on all the time. It was very, very natural. My parents \u2014 both my parents were voice teachers. So there were students traipsing in and out of the house all day long. When my father made his debut at the Met in 1955, the entire sort of African-American classical community would come by the house to congratulate my dad, you know, and there would always be singers in the house having sort of like singing parties. My mother was the soprano soloist at the church that I grew up in. So there was singing, singing, singing going on all the time. To me, it\u2019s very, very natural for me to break out into song, because I do it all the time. I\u2019ve been trying to think of ways to get an audience to sing even more than I\u2019ve allowed them to in the past. You know how can I really make them the band, you know. And what this woman said the other day, when she says, \u201CI really feel great now.\u201D This is what I want everyone to experience it \u2014 when at the end of my concert is everyone has got \u2014 has this sense of rejoicing or joy. Yeah. You know, because I want everyone to feel joy at the end of a concert. Not, I don\u2019t want them to be blown away by what I do. I want them to have this sense of real, real joy from the depths of their being. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, because I think when you take them to that place then you introduce \u2014 you open up a place where grace can come in, you know? Can you explain why \u2014 why music does that, why singing taps that place? Oh, God, isn\u2019t it a wonderful thing. It is a wonderful thing, what music can do. There have been nights when I\u2019ve walked on stage and I have felt absolutely awful, just terrible, you know, physically, you know, ill \u2014 raging headache or something, you know. And at the end of a concert, you know, I\u2019m 70 percent healed. You know, the headache is \u2026 Right. \u2026 is like gone away. Or there have been nights when I\u2019ve emotionally been just maybe a little bit off \u2014 maybe I\u2019ve had an argument with someone or a misunderstanding with one of my children or something like that, you know. And I walk on stage and I\u2019m just like (makes growling noise). Mm-hmm. OK, blah, blah, blah, you know, fists clenched and just sort of, you know, just hot, you know. And within a minute, you know, I\u2019m open, I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ve cooled off. I think the best way to sort of deal with temptation is to actually sing, you know? Really? Yeah. Yeah, if you\u2019re \u2014 if you\u2019re like tempted to say the wrong thing or whatever, you know, to open up your mouth and start singing is a great way to deflect negative emotion. I think it\u2019s a really good way to feed yourself some positive. Singing as an ethical discipline. There you go. And why not, yeah. So in \u2014 in a lot meditative traditions, there\u2019s this core insight that the breath unites mind and body and spirit. And voice, singing, is also a lot about breath, right? Yeah. Especially the way you do it. I was just kind of mulling over that again. It\u2019s not \u2014 so \u2014 so where this took me when I was thinking about you is, it also seems like the voice \u2014 which makes sense, because it\u2019s an extension of breath in many ways \u2014 also does this organic thing of getting us into alignment somehow, bringing mind and body and \u2026 Yeah, I at one point attempted to practice some kind of Buddhist breathing discipline, you know, watching my breath, you know, just simply watching it. Mm-hmm. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t enough for me, you know. But when I started singing, to me that\u2019s what was missing, you know. Watching my breath was one thing; watching a sound is another. Watching a sound on a breath is another thing altogether. And \u2014 and I\u2019ve pretty much kept up that discipline. Even now when I\u2019m on stage, I watch what comes out. I hear it, but I also watch to see. I mean you can imagine notes coming out of your mouth. You can imagine that when you sing, just like you can imagine words, you know. \u201CI love you,\u201D you can imagine that. Yeah. You know, and sounds \u2014 you can also imagine sound coming out of your mouth. So I like to think of sound coming out, going out, surrounding the room that I\u2019m in, you know, surrounding myself, surrounding people. So you mean that when you are singing though, you\u2019re watching the sound like you might watch the breath in meditation. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s happening and you\u2019re paying attention to it at the same time. I\u2019m paying attention to it, yes. You\u2019re simply watching it come out. Now, I have to say in the very beginning, I didn\u2019t understand that and I wasn\u2019t doing that. That came over time, you know, like, you know, when you do something any activity over, over, and over again. You\u2019ve been doing these interviews for \u2014 for years now, you know, and you don\u2019t even think about them, I guess, anymore. I guess you certainly do your research, I mean, we do our research, I mean \u2026 Yeah, but it\u2019s different every time, right? It\u2019s different every time. And every time it\u2019s risky, you don\u2019t know \u2014 you don\u2019t know what will happen. That\u2019s right. I mean, just knowing the techniques doesn\u2019t control the experience. That\u2019s right. And you don\u2019t even want the experience controlled. You know, I spend a lot of time \u2014 well quite a bit of time working with a pianist by the name of Chick Corea. And a few months ago, he was playing a club called the Blue Note in New York City, with Roy Haynes on drums. I can\u2019t remember who else was in the band. And I couldn\u2019t attend the gig, so he invited me to the sound check. So I just went to the sound check and I\u2019m sitting in the club and he\u2019s playing and the thing that struck me was the ease in which he played. You know, he\u2019s at that point \u2014 and all musicians want this. They want to get to the point where they don\u2019t think \u2014 they don\u2019t have to think anymore about their technique. Mm-hmm. They simply have it. It\u2019s not something they struggle to get, you know, anymore. They\u2019ve got it, you know; they\u2019re not conscious of themselves playing. They just play. You know, they\u2019re not thinking about playing; they\u2019re just playing. And it\u2019s taken me a long, long, long time to get there. I started singing at 27. I\u2019m 61. And now I can say that I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even think about singing. I just sing. Mm-hmm. You know? It just comes out. There use to be a point where I would be afraid of making mistakes. I\u2019m no longer afraid of making mistakes. I make them every night during a performance. Something happens: I meant for my voice to go right and it went left instead. I meant for my voice to go up and it goes down, you know. Wherever my voice goes, wherever it takes me I just follow it. I just watch it. It leads me to whatever, you know. I trust it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with a master of vocal improvisation, Bobby McFerrin. So much of what you say about what you\u2019ve learned about music is also just true of life, right? Yeah. I mean \u2014 right? I mean, the challenge of just being yourself, the reality that you will make mistakes and that it\u2019s \u2026 Oh, my goodness, yes, of course. Right? Yeah, that\u2019s right. Yeah, it\u2019s all about that. You know if you can\u2019t play with four strings, play with three. If you\u2019ve got a guitar with only one string on it, then play a one-string guitar. But you know you just use what you have and \u2014 and do your best. And there you have it. Do you ever think about what \u2014 what is it about you that made you \u2014 that \u2014 that has allowed you to inhabit music like this and really as a \u2014 what did I say at the beginning, I thought of you as, uh, an explorer on the frontier of music, but it\u2019s also as music as a human frontier. Well, you know, it\u2019s funny the first thing that came to my mind was watching my father give voice lessons. You know, have you \u2014 do you ever watch American Idol? My children watch it, I try. Yeah, I know. I try. Sure. You know, these singers have these wonderful voices, you know, I\u2019m, you know \u2014 every \u2026 Yeah, right. \u2026 once in a while, I thought to myself if I was asked to be like a guest judge on the show would I \u2014 would I volunteer would I do it? I don\u2019t know, but you know these singers, God bless them, God bless them, because they have wonderful instruments. They have a wonderful voice. They can sing well. They can sing in tune most of the time. Mm-hmm. You know, uh, they have wonderful instruments, but my father would say, \u201COK. So what? So what you got a wonderful instrument? So what you can sing in tune? So What?\u201D You know, big deal. You know, what we want is the core \u2014 your \u2014 your essence. We want your essence. That\u2019s what we want to hear more than anything, you know? Mm-hmm. That\u2019s what he was after. And I think that\u2019s what I got from him. Why I do what I do is because I\u2019m on \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking for that constantly. You look for it in a really different way though, right? In a very different way. You draw it out of people, maybe rather than pushing. Right. Yeah. You\u2019re pulling it out. Pulling it out. Yeah. So, you know, I want to talk to you about spiritualities in your work, and it\u2019s a hard thing to talk about \u2026 Why? It\u2019s in your music. It\u2019s hard to put words around. It is \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult \u2026 It\u2019s hard to put good-enough words \u2014 that\u2019s what I mean \u2026 \u2026 to put words around. It\u2019s hard to put good-enough words around. Yes, that\u2019s true. And I don\u2019t even think we could do justice to it with words \u2014 you know, talking about it in your music. Right. But can we try? We can. I mean, here\u2019s something I wanted to read to you. This was just some person on the Internet writing about VOCAbuLarieS, which is your 2010 album. Mm-hmm. And he\u2019s kind wary about spirituality, in general, and he\u2019s actually trying to make it work. He says, \u201CHe may be spiritual,\u201D of Bobby McFerrin, \u201Cbut he apparently knows the world of the flesh as well, and has a very wicked sense of humor.\u201D Now, what\u2019s interesting to me is he\u2019s writing that as though those things are at odds, but I think that that gets at some of the features of your spirituality that it\u2019s fleshly and it\u2019s humorous. Yes. Yes, but isn\u2019t it true though that it\u2019s a constant, constant battle between the spirit and the flesh that we live through every single day. Everyone has the spirit. Everyone is spiritual in the sense it\u2019s \u2014 is that the spirit is the animating factor of our lives. Without the spirit we couldn\u2019t be alive. I sincerely believe. You know, I remember when my wife\u2019s mother died, she said that when \u2014 the moment that her mother died, she knew that what she was looking at was no longer her mother because the spirit had left her body. Right. And it\u2019s the spirit that animates our life. But everyday from the moment that you get up until the hour that you go to bed, you are battling \u2014 your spirit and your flesh are battling for dominance, constantly, you know? You know that the right thing to do is to not say what\u2019s on your mind, even though it might be true and even though it might be necessary, but it\u2019s not kind. Mm-hmm. But you want to say it anyway, you\u2019re battling with the flesh and the spirit. The flesh says, just get it off your chest. And the spirit says, no wait, you know. Think, you know. Pause. Find the right word or the right time. Maybe now is not the time to do it. I mean it\u2019s a constant war. So what this guy is saying is absolutely true, but it\u2019s true for everyone. You know? Mm-hmm. But the spirituality in your music is embodied, right? It\u2019s fleshly too. I mean that joy \u2014 that joy that we \u2014 you talked about. That \u2014 that transformative thing that happens when you start singing is not just \u2014 it\u2019s not just about the sound. It\u2019s something that\u2019s happening in your whole body. And music has that transformative effect on a listener as well. Yeah, well, you know one of the things that I know in 90 minutes of performing on stage or being on stage is that I\u2019m in the battle with the flesh and I\u2019m going to win. You know at the end of \u2014 you know for 90 minutes I\u2019m victorious. Right. You know, I\u2019m going to win this battle, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. You know singing to me is like singing through the spirit. You know, once I had \u2014 I had an interesting experience once. I was in Paris, and I had four nights at this fabulous theater. And at the end of the first night, a woman came backstage and said that she had spent a year studying with this well-known ethnomusicologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. They had been studying African languages \u2014 particularly African languages that had been extinct or near extinction. She introduced who she was and she says, \u201CI want to know how you know these languages that I have been studying for the last year, because I heard you singing them.\u201D Now, I said \u2026 Really? Yeah, I said to her, \u201CWell, I hate to disappoint you, but I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. You know, I just open up my mouth and I sing whatever comes out, you know, (singing melody) you know, because to me that is a language and it sounds better than (singing melody). It just sounds a lot more interesting.\u201D Yeah. She says, \u201CWell, you know, I heard moments when you were singing these sounds, these languages, you know, that I had been working on. I want to know how you know them.\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know them and I hate to disappoint you.\u201D But what that got me thinking about was the fact that we are \u2014 we are embodied memories of our ancestors. I have my father in me \u2014 I have information in my head. I know my dad; I can tell you stories about my dad because he told me them or I watched them. And he in turn has a memory of his father, and so on and so on. So I began to think, well am I \u2014 you know, am I accessing a memory when I sing? And this is the only way I can access it by \u2014 is through my voice, you know. Is that \u2014 is this the way I get to it? I find that actually kind of interesting. That\u2019s really interesting. You know, it\u2019s like an ancestral memory, like, we all have it, you know. So how far back does it go? I mean, maybe it goes all the way back, you know. Do you think singing is older than language? That music is older than words. I don\u2019t know for sure. Do I think that it \u2014 that music is a \u2014 is a tool for more than entertainment? Definitely. Is it a tool for inner attainment? I use it for that. I use it to pray, you know. I sing my prayers \u2014 in my room, in the morning. In my morning discipline, you know, I walk the floor back and forth, back and forth and pray. And sometimes, all of sudden, I just start singing something because it\u2019s the best way I can get it out, you know. How do you think about mystery? Is that a word you use? I do. I use it quite a bit. I love the mystery of improvisation \u2014 you never know what\u2019s going to happen, you know. I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen tonight; I\u2019m looking forward to finding out. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. That evening Bobby McFerrin performed a solo show to a sold-out audience at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. The music you heard this hour came from several of his albums, including VOCAbuLarieS, Medicine Music, and Beyond Words. He has a new album called SpiritYouAll. You can listen again to the entire playlist at our website, onbeing.org. There you\u2019ll also find that mesmerizing video of Bobby McFerrin at the World Science Festival, and you can watch or listen to my entire conversation with him.
