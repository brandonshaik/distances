  "fullText": "For a long time, our listeners have been talking to us about running as a passionate force in their lives and a connector across all kinds of boundaries in American culture, running not just as exercise or as merely physical pursuit \u2014 running as a source of bonding between parents and children and friends, running as an interplay between competition and contemplation, running and body image and survival and healing. People from high school now tell me, \u201CI never thought you would have become a runner of any kind.\u201D I always used to tell people, \u201CI\u2019m not a runner. My body could never do that.\u201D And once I did it, it was this feeling of \u2014 \u201CWhat else have I been lying to myself about? What else have I been hiding from\u00A0because I was scared?\u201D The number one objective of my Olympic pursuit was to heal a broken soul. And I look back, it just blows me away, a 77-year-old man, and I know what it is to be broken, but I also know what it is to be on a healing journey. When people see me on the street with my turban and beard, they have a number of preconceptions about the type of person I am. At worst, they associate me with terrorism. In most cases, people at least see me as someone who is foreign or strange. So running is, for me, a simple way to shatter these stereotypes. It challenges people to see me from a different perspective than they would otherwise. \u201CWhen I was training for my second marathon \u2014 I was running Chicago, and I went to go get some new shoes. And the guy at the running store, I was telling him, \u201CYeah, I\u2019m not super-excited about this. I just want to get through. I\u2019m kind of nervous about my time and everything.\u201D And he was like, \u201CYeah, the best thing for you to remember is that the blessing is outside of your comfort zone.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Thomas Merton wrote, \u201CIt is true that we are called to create a better world. But we are first of all called to a more immediate and exalted task: that of creating our own lives.\u201D Our producer Lily Percy took up the idea of running as a spiritual practice as a theme for the first season of our new podcast, Creating Our Own Lives. The ten voices in this hour were originally drawn out by her. We\u2019ll end with Olympic gold medalist Billy Mills. We begin with Christina Torres. My name is Christina Torres, and I\u2019m originally from Southern California, but I now live in Honolulu, Hawaii. Christina is many things \u2014 a teacher, a writer, a Mexipina. She calls running her \u201Cmoving meditation.\u201D Pretty much towards the end of college and the beginning of my teaching career, I had actually never run more than a mile. I hated running. I was always really bad at it. It always made my chest hurt. I actually left soccer \u2014 which made my Mexican father really sad \u2014 because, I told him, it was too much running, and I didn\u2019t like it. I was the kid that would beg my parents to give me a doctor\u2019s note so I wouldn\u2019t have to run the mile. Running was always sort of associated with things I wasn\u2019t good at, with shame. I was one of maybe a handful of Mexican kids in my school. And I was chubbier than a lot of other kids, and so I was picked on, because I was really bad at anything athletic. So for me, running did not have great associations, actually, until I was a little bit older. I was actually looking at a bookstore, and there was this book called How To Do Everything. It\u2019s one of those novelty books. And in that, they had a little thing about learning to walk-run, which is, essentially, you\u2019ll break running up into intervals. So you\u2019ll run 30 seconds, walk one minute, run 30 seconds, walk one minute, and you\u2019ll do that for a week or two. And then you\u2019ll change the intervals, so you\u2019ll run for a minute, walk for a minute, run for a minute, and then you increase until you\u2019re running. And I remember that finally, after maybe two months, I was able to run 30 minutes, not very fast, but 30 minutes completely without stopping. And that was right towards the end of my senior year, and I had never done that in my entire life. I was like, \u201COh, my body can do things.\u201D And I never really looked at my body that way, like, \u201CMy body can be trained to do new things.\u201D And I was hooked, and I\u2019ve sort of been running ever since. Sometimes, we\u2019re not all feeling great about ourselves. And I woke up one morning \u2014 you know, you just have those mornings, and you look in the mirror, you\u2019re like, \u201CI hate this.\u201D It\u2019s so irrational. You know that nothing has changed in the past, what, seven hours since you went to bed. Nothing is different, but you wake up, and it\u2019s almost like my body isn\u2019t mine \u2014 which makes me sad, because all of my body is mine. If anything, it\u2019s the only thing that is truly mine. So for me, though, once I started running, it was really hard to be angry at my body in the same way. I would get out on the road and all of a sudden, step by step, it was like running myself back to myself in a lot of ways. So it\u2019s nice to know that there\u2019s always going to be this place I can go where it\u2019s just me and the road. And there\u2019s something really beautiful about that. I did the L.A. Marathon. And I mean I\u2019ll be honest with you, it went horribly. I hit the wall, essentially, because I also went out way too fast. And so I knew I wasn\u2019t going to make this time, and I ended up getting picked up by a pacer. And I was crying, and I kept sort of saying, \u201CI don\u2019t know if I can do this. I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201D And he was like, \u201CFind a mantra in your head and just keep saying it over and over again.\u201D And it\u2019s funny, because it\u2019s changed now, but for me, it\u2019s been \u201CI am strong. I am powerful. I can do this. I am strong. I am powerful. I can do this.\u201D And I just kept saying that over and over again. And I finished, and I didn\u2019t finish as fast as I wanted, and my feet were bleeding. I think I nearly threw up. But I crossed the finish line just being like, if you had told me six months ago that I was going to be able to finish 26.2 miles, I would have laughed in your face. I always used to tell people, \u201CI\u2019m not a runner. My body could never do that.\u201D And once I did it, it was this feeling of, \u201CWhat else have I been lying to myself about? [laughs] What else have I been hiding from because I was scared?\u201D My first memory of running is probably a lot more recent than in actuality. I\u2019m sure that I chased my brother around and my other siblings around as a kid. But I actually remember running between my dormitory at the University of Minnesota and the rec center during my first year of college and, in particular, one day when it was minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit. And I remember running in these Converse All Star shoes as my throat was burning, and yet being so incredibly happy to be kind of braving the weather and quite proud of myself at the moment. John Cary is a trained architect who thinks about human-centered design. He\u2019s also a strategist for the TED prize. My ideal running is running with other people, running with a partner, in particular. And I\u2019m really lucky to have the most amazing running partner. I\u2019ve had several over the years, but one in particular, at this moment in my life, is another young father, so we end up talking a lot about fatherhood and work things, of course, and all that. And I typically do run with other men, and I\u2019ve found that some of the best conversations I\u2019ve ever had in my life with other men have been while running. And I think part of it is, you\u2019re running, often, side-by-side or one person in back of the other, rather than having to deal with looking somebody in the eyes as you\u2019re being vulnerable with them or sharing a story or whatever it might be. But I truly have had some of the best conversations. And my current running partner, Peter, is a big part of that these days. I\u2019m kind of a mid-distance runner. I do about one marathon a year, and I love that distance, but I especially find in those later miles, including the miles right before I finish, to just truly get into a stride, get into a flow. And there are places on my favorite runs where I\u2019m just flooded with a certain smell of, like, eucalyptus trees, here in the Bay area, or other smells. There\u2019s also little microclimates that I run through at different times, and I can just feel that all over. And that has far less to do with the kind of physical motion that I\u2019m in and just more to do with passing through time and space. My daughter has run with me for, I\u2019d say, a third of the miles that I\u2019ve logged since she was born. And I mean I try to run somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 miles a year. That\u2019s about 30 miles a week. And about a third of that is with her. And so I\u2019m literally pushing her \u2014 it started with this large running stroller that we then put this contraption onto so you could place her large car seat in there. And it was kind of like pushing a shopping cart, which is one thing on an urban sidewalk, but another thing in some of the hills that we do in the Bay area. I would be pushing her to the top of this beautiful cemetery overlooking the Bay, and people would drive by in cars and clap or cheer us on or something like that. And of course, she\u2019s snoozing away, and I\u2019m drenched in sweat. But I love those moments. I love running with her. I especially love talking with her as I\u2019m running. And I do any number of things, from practicing animal sounds with her to telling her all the people in the world that love her, and over the course of a run, I\u2019m able to name like 50 or 60 people in her life. And she \u2014 whether or not she\u2019s processing it is another question, but I just love those times we have together. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, running as a spiritual practice, as told through the voices and stories of runners. Some people turn to prayer or meditation or yoga as a way to slow down and make sense of their lives. Ashley Hicks found that in running. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and she\u2019s the co-founder of Black Girls RUN! I was able to really kind of break through the mental part of running in around 2006, when I started running after college. I was just trying to get back in shape \u2014 I hadn\u2019t been playing soccer \u2014\u00A0and started running. And I really found that it was a way to really decompress after work. So you go out there, and you\u2019re out there for a couple of miles, and you can process and think through things and relieve stress. So that was really what helped me break through this idea of miles of nothingness that running initially felt like for me. When I run, the one thing that I like to do is, I don\u2019t run with music, headphones, anything \u2014 I call myself a true minimalist runner. Literally, it\u2019s just me and my running clothes. And I like to go out, and I start out slow. And then I will pick up my pace after that, but for me, it\u2019s just the idea of allowing myself to settle into the run, settle in and to feel the road beneath your feet, settle in and really acknowledge your surroundings. When I run, it\u2019s this idea of really being present and acknowledging where I am and what I\u2019m doing and the purpose. So when I started running in 2006, running was not the most diverse community. I\u2019d go to these local races, like a local 5k or local running groups, and I would be pretty much the only person of color. And so I just noticed that maybe there\u2019s an opportunity there. Maybe there\u2019s an opportunity to talk to people about the benefits of running \u2014 health, physically and mentally \u2014 and then also just see if there are other runners of color that I can connect with. And so we started Black Girls RUN! in 2009. Initially, we just connected with other runners, people who were already doing marathons and half-marathons, and dedicated runners. And then we started to see more and more people join the group who had never run a day in their life. And so that was an incredible experience, to introduce people to this old sport that\u2019s new in our community. And now we get emails from race directors all the time, saying how diverse races are becoming. And just the running community in general is changing, and people seem to love the change. I definitely think that running has helped me become \u2014 certainly, more spiritual, certainly, more present. It was interesting, when I was training for my second marathon \u2014 I was running Chicago \u2014 and I went to go get some new shoes. And the guy at the running store, I was telling him, \u201CYeah, I\u2019m not super-excited about this. I just want to get through. I\u2019m kind of nervous about my time and everything.\u201D And he was like, \u201CYeah, the best thing for you to remember is that the blessing is outside of your comfort zone.\u201D And so that was something for me to really kind of think about, and it was something that I would actually meditate on, literally just saying over and over and over in my head as I continued my training. And it\u2019s something that I do now \u2014 whenever I\u2019m challenging myself to something new, I keep saying that. The blessing really is outside of your comfort zone. If you stay and do what you\u2019re comfortable with, you\u2019ll never experience something new and incredible. My name is Roger Joslin, and I\u2019m from Austin, Texas. I think my most vivid early memories of running were when I played football in junior high and high school, and running was used to get us in shape and as punishment. Most any infraction, we were called on to run wind sprints until we puked our guts out. And in preparation for football season, I would train on the country roads near our house, running sprints and then running distances so that I would show up in some sort of reasonable physical condition when two-a-days started. And so I didn\u2019t take to running right away. I\u2019d always viewed running as something very unpleasant till about my mid-20s. Then I began to appreciate running for itself. Roger Joslin is an Episcopal priest in Bentonville, Arkansas. He\u2019s also the author of Running the Spiritual Path. I was going through a very troubled period of my life where I had faced a bankruptcy and divorce and was separated from my family. I wouldn\u2019t see my kids as much as I had been accustomed to. And I was working out of town in San Antonio, Texas, and I started to run there after I got off work. And I ran, and I ran, and I ran, simply because I found that it was a distraction from the pain I was feeling. I could punish my body a bit and hurt in different places. I think I approached it the same way maybe somebody who was better at drinking whiskey than I was might have. I ran to feel different than I was feeling, just to escape from the pain. And I had noticed that \u2014 I\u2019d been meditating for a number of years, not terribly successfully, and I began to notice that my running life and my meditating life were beginning to merge. One day, I came across an article about Thomas Merton in which Thomas Merton was quoted as saying that \u201Cprayer is the desire to pray.\u201D And I didn\u2019t really know about prayer as equating it with meditation. And so my notion of what prayer is about began to expand, because I imagine that God is most fully present with us at this moment, and to the extent to which you can find yourself in the present moment, then you\u2019re finding yourself in prayer. So it worked quite naturally with running, with me, to begin to find ways of running that brought me into the present. And so I imagined how a priest might put on his vestments before going to celebrate the Eucharist, doing it very mindfully. So I would approach running the same way if I put on my shorts and T-shirt and then pull on my socks and make sure that there\u2019s no creases in them, smooth them out and pull them up just right and examine my shoes to make sure there\u2019s not any pebbles or dirt inside and lace up the shoelaces very carefully and double-knot them and simply just pay attention to what I\u2019m doing. And so to the extent to which I can prepare my mind and my body to receive, then I think I\u2019ve prepared myself for both the run and for the prayer. I didn\u2019t like running a lot as a kid. It was sort of a thing that was forced on us in grade school and junior high and high school. But I started to love running when I had this job \u2014 I was managing apartment buildings, and I was always meeting with people to try to rent them apartments, so I was walking around in the D.C. heat all during the day and trying not to sweat and look unappealing. But at 5 o\u2019clock, I started this practice where I would just go running. And then it didn\u2019t matter what I looked like or what it felt like, it didn\u2019t matter what the weather was, whether it was raining or hot or cold. It was, for me, a way to just jump into the world and let it come at me with whatever it had. Mike Stavlund is a pastor, writer, and professor living in Falls Church, Virginia. He\u2019s the author of A Force of Will: The Reshaping of Faith in a Year of Grief, about the death of his four-month-old son. \u201CRunning,\u201D Mike says, \u201Cbecame a metaphor for my life.\u201D One of the things I love about it is that it\u2019s not mental. There\u2019s not a lot of things that I find that happen in my mind. In that sense, I think I learned about meditation through running instead of learning about meditation through studying meditation. So much of my life is \u2014 my mind is just buzzing and busy and worried about a lot of stuff and needing to accomplish things and worry about things. But when I\u2019m running, I can kind of get away from that, and I just am in my body, with all of its limitations, but with all of its capabilities at the same time. And I think that integration works, as well, with my spiritual goals. I\u2019m so limited in so many ways. I\u2019m so not the person that I want to be. But I\u2019m capable of slowly, gradually becoming something later that I\u2019m not now. My son, before he died \u2014 he\u2019d struggled for his whole life, four months of life, with some really serious cardiac limitations. And so running for me then was a way of kind of experiencing some of that. It\u2019s emotional to remember that. But I remember just being out on these runs in our hilly neighborhood and feeling so hot, like I couldn\u2019t catch a breath, and feeling like I was really out of shape, because I hadn\u2019t really been running regularly before that, and just realizing \u2014 gosh, this is what his life was like. So it was cathartic in that sense, and it was a way for me to just kind of taste some of what that was like. I was tempted to just go full bore and try to run myself into the ground, because I realized me running as hard as I can isn\u2019t even as hard as it was for him to just lay in his bed and to try to keep up with all these cardiac inefficiencies. So it definitely was a way for me to connect with him and do so almost retroactively, because when he was alive, it was too much for me to think about all that. I needed to just do what I had to do to care for him and to try to help him make it to his next day. I teach ethics, and in ethics we talk about instrumental goods versus inherent goods. There are things that we do because they get us to another thing. Some people run because it helps burn calories and helps them lose weight. But for me, running is an inherent good. It\u2019s good in and of itself. It\u2019s essentially beneficial. So I\u2019m excited because my kids are starting to be like, \u201CI want to go running,\u201D and there\u2019s no reason \u2014 they don\u2019t have a reason to run. They\u2019re not training for something, they just want to go running, and it\u2019s just an enjoyable, inherent part of being human, I think. So they\u2019re starting to, and yeah, my wife and I are trying to find ways to interact with all their paces and all that stuff \u2014 they want to have it happen the way they want it to happen, but it\u2019s more fun for us.

On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring running as a spiritual practice in all kinds of lives and as told through the voices and stories of runners. : My name is Sarah Khasawinah. I was born in Chicago, raised in Missouri, and went to school along the East Coast. And now I live just outside of Washington, D.C. Sarah works in the U.S. Senate to improve policies for older Americans. In elementary school, we had running as an exercise in school, and I never finished in the first half of the class. In fact, I always finished in the last half of the class and at that point thought I probably wasn\u2019t very good at running. And I rediscovered running again later in high school, because I was doing a program that required us to do action hours, and I thought, \u201CWouldn\u2019t it be wild if I signed up for the cross country team?\u201D I almost always came in last on my team \u2014 not usually last in the whole meet, but definitely in the back of the pack. And one time, during a really, really particularly hot day, I was way in the back of the pack. The referee, I think, thought everybody was gone, and when he saw me, he was like, \u201COh, well, have a nice day.\u201D I was like, \u201CI am.\u201D And that, I think, may have been one of the turning points where I realized running is something that I enjoy. I enjoy the journey, and I\u2019m having a nice day every time I\u2019m running. My faith makes me disciplined \u2014 I pray five times a day. Year round, I am basically waking up somewhere between 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning. So I\u2019m awake, and when I wake up, I do the ablution ritual to wash up and get ready for prayer, and then I pray. And then I\u2019m up. My mind and my body are awake. So the next best thing to do is run. So I think that from the discipline aspect of my faith, faith improves my running, and running improves my faith. It gives me an opportunity to meditate and to reflect and think about verses from the Qur\u2019an and to actively practice gratitude, which is a big component of Islam. In the Qur\u2019an, multiple times, God puts thankfulness up there after believing in God, and being thankful is constantly one of the most important things. And when I\u2019m running, I feel like I\u2019m actively expressing that gratitude \u2014 first of all, by being able to use my limbs and the faculties that God gave me to run. And also, I\u2019m outside, and when my strides are comfortable, and I feel like nobody\u2019s looking, sometimes I\u2019ll sort of spread my arms out and just think, \u201CThank you, God. This is beautiful.\u201D The point in which I think a run begins to feel truly spiritual is after that first hour, when I think about verses from the Qur\u2019an about how God takes barren fields and blesses them with the rain and brings them back to life. And in the Qur\u2019an, that analogy is often used to compare how humans are, the cycle of life and how we will be brought back to life. So then I begin to think about my own mortality. And that\u2019s an often-re-occurring thought for me on runs, after I\u2019ve emptied my brain of all of the regular things that I need to think about and to clear my mind. And it just happens organically, without even thinking about it. And there\u2019s a little period in between, usually, where I\u2019m just thinking of nothing \u2014 and at that point, I feel like I\u2019m just receiving what\u2019s around me. My name is Mallary Tenore. I grew up outside of Boston, Massachusetts. My first memory of running was actually when I was three years old. In the small town of Holliston, Massachusetts, where I grew up, they held these track meets for kids ages 3 to 13. And my mom took me there right after I turned 3, and she said, \u201CWell, these are races where you get to run down a track, and then you get a ribbon at the end.\u201D And I really didn\u2019t exactly know what that meant. I had never been to a track meet before, and as a 3-year-old I really didn\u2019t even do much running except for running around the house and falling down. And so my mom said, \u201CAll you have to do is just run down the track until you see me, and then I\u2019ll give you a big hug at that finish line.\u201D And so the guy who was running these track meets would say, \u201COn your mark, get set, go,\u201D and I\u2019d run down that track, the 50 yards, and I\u2019d be weaving in and out of lanes, and my pigtails would be flying, and I\u2019d be hitting elbows with the other 3-year-olds who were running with me. But I just kept focused on my goal, which was running toward my mom. At the end, I would always sort of run into her arms, and I would get a ribbon, and really, that is what fueled my initial love for running. A lot of times people will say that runners run away from things, but I\u2019ve always found that I\u2019ve been running towards something. And I think that I\u2019ve thought that for so many years because my love for running started with me running toward my mom. Mallary is a journalist, and a mother herself. I was 11 years old when my mother passed away, and she had had a three-year struggle with breast cancer. And when she passed away, I really was in complete shock. Even though I knew that she was sick, everyone in my family said that she was going to be OK. And as an 11-year-old who was quite optimistic, I really did think that she was going to make it. And so when she passed away, I really felt like I had lost all control. And so I began to search for something that I could have control over. And for me, that was food. And I started to severely decrease my food intake. I started to obsessively exercise and got so sick that I ended up in the hospital multiple times and in residential treatment for a year and a half. And one of the ways that I sort of integrated myself back into high school, since I was away for about three years, was by joining the cross country team. And I would say that in the years since graduating college, I\u2019ve done so much better. I mean I\u2019ve come so much farther than I ever thought that I would, from that little girl who was 66 pounds and very unhealthy. But I still have to kind of keep in mind the fact that running could have a potentially detrimental effect if I begin to be too obsessive about it or if I start to only focus on burning calories. And so when I told my nutritionist and my therapist that I was thinking of running a marathon, they were both very skeptical, and they said, \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know. This could be really bad for you. It could make you slip back into old behaviors.\u201D But for me, I really wanted to do it, almost as a way to say that I don\u2019t want my eating issues to restrict what I can do in this world and in my life. And I found that as I trained for the marathon, I was actually much more focused on staying strong and staying healthy than I was on losing weight. And it wasn\u2019t always easy, so it was a real learning experience but also a real reminder of all the work that I\u2019ve done to let go of a lot of those eating issues that I so deeply struggled with. I used to think a lot that my mom really wanted me to be perfect, and I think a lot of people who have struggled with eating issues tend to be Type A, tend to be perfectionists. And in some ways, while I was running, it was sort of liberating and freeing, because I was trying to let go of that perfectionism and that tendency that I have to say, \u201COh, you have to get the best time, and you have to run the best\u201D and was really holding onto this gift of running that my mother gave me. I grew up running, actually. I was a soccer player growing up and so a lot of distance running. I didn\u2019t enjoy running without a ball. It was an obligation for the privilege of being able to play soccer. It changed for me when I moved to Boston. I had just finished college, I was starting my graduate school at Harvard, and I didn\u2019t have a community with whom I could play soccer or basketball or any of the sports that I loved. And so I just found myself on the Charles River, and I just started to enjoy having that time to myself to think about anything that was on my mind, whether it was something related to my studies, introspection having to do with my own spirituality, thinking about my family and friends. It was just a really nice way to reflect. In the Sikh tradition of Simran Jeet Singh, there is a duty \u201Cto hone the spiritual body in the same way that we hone our spiritual selves.\u201D Sikhism sees the world as truth, and that truth permeates the entirety of the world. So \u201CThe Creator is in the creation and the creation is in the Creator\u201D is a phrase we often pull from our scriptures \u2014 \u201Ckhaalik khalak khalak meh khaalik poor rahi-o sarab thaa-n-ee.\u201D And God is absolutely embedded in everything. And so service becomes a very important aspect of spirituality, of religious living. And so one of the ways in which I find running to be incredibly powerful as a community service \u2014 I know most people don\u2019t think of running as service \u2014 but one of the things for me is, when people see me on the street with my turban and beard, they have a number of preconceptions about the type of person I am, and most of these assumptions are deeply negative. At worst, they associate me with terrorism, which has happened to me on a number of my runs. In most cases, people at least see me as someone who is foreign or strange. So running is, for me, a simple way to shatter these stereotypes. It challenges people to see me from a different perspective than they would otherwise. I think probably the most unexpected way in which running has formed me has been its shaping of my discipline. I think the very practice of engaging in something every single day is, in and of itself, sort of a ritual that shapes somebody much in the way that religious ritual would. And so in that sense, I think running has really contributed to my ethical formation, in that it has helped to create a sense of accountability and of mental fortitude so that when I am faced with situations that are difficult, I am more likely to say and do the right thing because of this daily practice of running. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring running as a spiritual practice, as told through the voices and stories of runners. My first memory of running is outrunning my older brother. One of his forms of entertainment, when I was a child, was to just tease, torment, torture in any way that he could, and it didn\u2019t take me very long to figure out that I could outrun him. So probably about the time I was five years old, I started hitting the streets to get away from him. Christy Marvin is an award-winning, record-breaking mountain runner in Palmer, Alaska. She\u2019s a devout Christian who weaves faith and prayer into extreme sport, climbing up cliffs, running through mud and snow. Christy excels in these terrains, and she\u2019s raising three boys who do, as well. When you\u2019re a mom, and you\u2019re at home, the quickest way to get your child\u2019s attention is to sit down and look comfortable. So for me to connect with God on a real one-on-one basis and undistracted when I\u2019m at home and I have three screaming children running around the house \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really happen. So my running time is my alone time, and it is my time when I rejuvenate my mind and my body and when I really do feel like I not only come back from my runs with what they call a runner\u2019s high, I come back with a spiritual high, as well, because the whole time that I\u2019m out there running, I am praying, and I\u2019m talking to God, and I\u2019m asking him to help me in all different walks of my life, help to be a better wife and a better mother. And particularly when I\u2019m competing, I do find what I call \u201Cpower verses\u201D that I look for before every race that I run. And I really think on those, and I commit them to memory so that I can pull on them, and I can call on them when I reach those points in the race when I feel weak and I don\u2019t feel like I can do it on my own, and I feel like I need a greater strength and power. There\u2019s some in Psalms \u2014 Psalms 46:1-3 says, \u201CGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the Earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.\u201D The races, I absolutely do get wrapped up in the competition, and I do want to win when I step on the starting line. I don\u2019t just go at it from the perspective of another time of prayer and meditation \u2014 I mean I\u2019m out there to compete. But I absolutely know that I cannot do it on my own and that I cannot even begin to push myself to the extent that God can help me to push myself. And two years ago in Mount Marathon, when I came down to the bottom of the mountain, my legs felt like noodles. They felt like they were going to buckle. Everything in your body is hurting at that point.\u00A0Sometimes, when the pain gets to be too much, I literally call on God, and I just say that \u201CJesus, you have to carry me all the way home, because I feel too weak on my own, and I just need you to pull me through.\u201D I knew that he hadn\u2019t brought me this far to see me fail now and that I really just needed to act out all of that training and all of the preparation that together we had done through those many hours spent on the trails and up mountains and over rivers. And I just needed to dig, and I needed to call on every ounce of strength that I had left. We close this hour with Olympic Gold Medalist Billy Mills. He won a gold medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. There, he set a world record in the 10,000-meter race, and he is still the only American to win a gold medal in that event. Billy grew up on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. My first memory of running was, a Jesuit priest gave my father what I\u2019ll call a book, but it was actually a collection of articles. And one of the articles said, as my dad read them to me, \u201COlympians are chosen by the gods.\u201D And I wanted to become an Olympian. I wanted to be chosen by the gods. And it had absolutely nothing to do with the Olympic Games \u2014 my mother had just died, and I thought if I was chosen by the gods, even if they were the Olympic gods, perhaps I would be able to see my mother again. At that point, I thought I would try boxing. I had six fights in the ring, zero wins, and six losses. And that hurt. I tried basketball. I was slow. I got in for a game and lost it because I went to the wrong basket and scored two points. Football hurt. But I ran, and then I felt spirituality. I could feel my feet pounding against the earth. I could breathe in, and if the wind is blowing in the right direction a quarter of a mile away, there would be some wildflowers, and I could inhale the fragrance of the flowers, and it felt spiritual. The first official track meet I was in, the little Indian boys lined up, we go into this white community, and all of the young white athletes had on track shoes, track uniforms. I had on basketball shoes, Levi\u2019s, and a T-shirt. At the School of Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota, I got dead last in the 400 meters, but I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the movement, the activity. So when my dad died when I was 12, I didn\u2019t really pursue much running, then I get to high school. I am 5\u20191\u201D, 102 pounds, the second-smallest young boy at the school, Haskell Indian School in Lawrence, Kansas. And the coach was talking to us, and he simply said, \u201COne of you can do something magical in sport. One of you could become a great athlete.\u201D Just having the coach point at me, saying, \u201COne of you could do something magical,\u201D I felt it was my dad speaking to me. My sophomore year, the third race I ran, I won. Was undefeated the rest of my high school career. So I came out of high school with the fourth fastest mile in the nation, making good grades, ended up with a full athletic scholarship at the University of Kansas. My practice, as I got ready for the Olympic Games, started when I was still in college. And I came so close to suicide, because society was breaking me. I was caught between Plessy vs. Ferguson, white and black America, equal but separate, being overturned with Brown vs. Board of Education. So in many ways, if you were not a white athlete or a black athlete, you didn\u2019t fit into this change that was occurring in America \u2014 white leadership, black leadership, in conflict for equality. So if you were maybe Latino, Hispanic, Native American, Asian \u2014 male, female \u2014 you didn\u2019t really fit into that equation. So I felt like I didn\u2019t belong, yet I was facing some of the racism. When I made All-American \u2014 and this has happened at several occasions \u2014 many people were taking photographs, but there was always one photographer, three years in a row, who asked me to get out of the photo. And I remember a little bit of me breaking. I go back to my hotel room, and I\u2019m going to jump. And I didn\u2019t hear it through my ears, I heard it underneath my skin \u2014 movement. And the movement, in many ways, formed a word \u2014\u00A0the energy of the movement. I felt I could hear \u201CDon\u2019t.\u201D Four times \u2014 the fourth time, powerful, gentle, loving \u2014 \u201CDon\u2019t.\u201D And to me, it was my dad\u2019s voice. So I\u2019m crying, and I wrote down a dream: \u201CGold medal, 10,000-meter run. The Creator has given me the ability. The rest is up to me. Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe.\u201D And what I did, I took the Native American culture, tradition, spirituality. They became the core of my Olympic pursuit, simply because I felt the virtues and the values of culture, tradition, spirituality that are positive would give me confidence, would give me direction, would give me a clarity of mind to make a positive decision and stay the course. And that became the core of my Olympic training. It was, in a sense, not to win a gold medal at the Games, although I wanted to try to win the gold medal, I wanted to try to get a world record. But the number one objective of my Olympic pursuit was to heal a broken soul. And I look back, it just blows me away, a 77-year-old man, and I know what it is to be broken, but I also know what it is to be on a healing journey. You feel you\u2019re never healed, but the journey, you know, is a lifetime. I\u2019ll tell you what went through my mind when I was running my Olympic race. So now we\u2019re in Tokyo, Japan. The race is under way. Lap after lap, runners fall behind. I remember crossing the three-mile within one second of my fastest three-mile ever. But we had over three more miles to go. There was absolutely no way I could continue, but it was just one more try, one more try. 120 meters to go, I feel like I\u2019m 12 yards behind. I\u2019ve got to go now. Lifting my knees, lengthening my stride, pumping my arms. Coming off the final curve, 95, maybe 85 meters, I can see the finish line. And as I go by the runner that moved into lane five so I can go by him, I look. Out of the corner of my eye, on his jersey, I saw an eagle. It was back to my dad, so powerful \u2014 \u201CYou do these things, Son, someday you can have wings of an eagle.\u201D It was wings of an eagle. \u201CI can win. I can win. I can win.\u201D 60 meters to go, maybe 55 meters to go, the thoughts were so powerful. \u201CI may never be this close again. I\u2019ve got to do it now.\u201D I felt the tape break across my chest. An official came up to me, and he says, \u201CWho are you? Who are you?\u201D And I go, \u201COh, my God, did I miscount the laps?\u201D He said, \u201CFinished. The new Olympic champion.\u201D And I put one finger up, and I said, \u201CDid I win? Number one?\u201D He says, \u201CNew Olympic champion.\u201D I said, \u201CI\u2019ve got to find the runner to tell him the eagle on his singlet helped me win.\u201D I found him, I look, and there\u2019s no eagle. It was simply a perception. And I realized that perceptions create us or destroy us, but we have that opportunity to create our own journey.
