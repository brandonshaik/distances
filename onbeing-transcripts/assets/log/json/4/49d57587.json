  "fullText": "Beauty isn\u2019t all about just nice, loveliness like. Beauty is about more rounded substantial becoming. So I think beauty in that sense is about an emerging fullness, a greater sense of grace and elegance, a deeper sense of depth, and also a kind of homecoming for the enriched memory of your unfolding life. John O\u2019Donohue was an Irish poet and philosopher beloved for his books, including Anam \u010Aara, which is Gaelic for \u201Csoul friend,\u201D and for his insistence on beauty as a human calling and a defining aspect of God. He died in 2008, and this was one of the last interviews he gave. John O\u2019Donohue had a very Celtic lifelong fascination with what he called \u201Cthe invisible world.\u201D His voice and writings continue to bring ancient mystical wisdom to modern confusions and longings. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Anam \u010Aara was published in 1997, and it became an international best-seller. John O\u2019Donohue\u2019s final work, Echoes of Memory, a collection of blessings, was published posthumously. He was born in 1956 in County Clare in western Ireland. Historically, this part of the world was a crucible of Celtic Christianity, merging a strong sense of mystery with a passionate embrace of nature, the body, and the senses. The divine is understood as manifest everywhere in everything. John O\u2019Donohue entered seminary at a young age and was a Catholic priest for 19 years. But in the 1980s, he went to Germany to study the philosophy of Hegel. He eventually left the priesthood and devoted himself full-time to meditating and writing on beauty, friendship, and how the visible and the invisible \u2014 the material and the spiritual \u2014 intertwine in human experience. Tell me a little bit more about where you come from and what formed you? What began to form you to come to this spiritual perspective and philosophical and poetic perspective that you have now? Well, I suppose I was blessed by being born into an amazing landscape in the west of Ireland. Yes. And it\u2019s the Burren region, which is limestone. And it\u2019s a bare limestone landscape. And I often think that the forms of the limestone are so abstract and aesthetic, and it is as if they were all laid down by some wild surrealistic kind of deity. So soon \u2014 being a child and coming out into that, it was waiting like a huge wild invitation to extend your imagination. And then it\u2019s right on the edge of the ocean as well, and so a conversation \u2014 an ancient conversation between the ocean and the stone going on. I know that \u201Clandscape\u201D is a really pivotal word for you that you use, not just in describing the natural world but an important word in talking about how human beings know themselves and move through the world. I haven\u2019t been to precisely the place you are from; but I think the west coast of Scotland, the west coast of Ireland, it is this completely unusual, this wild raw, bleak beauty. But talk to me about how you have come to understand landscape as something that forms each of us. Well, I think it makes a huge difference when you wake in the morning and come out of your house. Whether you believe you are walking into dead geographical location, which is used to get to a destination, or whether you are emerging out into a landscape that is just as much, if not more, alive as you but in a totally different form. And if you go towards it with an open heart and a real watchful reverence, that you will be absolutely amazed at what it will reveal to you. And I think that that was one of the recognitions of the Celtic imagination: that landscape wasn\u2019t just matter, but that it was actually alive. What amazes me about landscape, landscape recalls you into a mindful mode of stillness, solitude, and silence where you can truly receive time. Are you just talking though about landscape as the natural world around us? I\u2019ll tell you, I remember a summer I spent a few years after I had first gone to this beautiful, raw, wild edge of Scotland, and I was working with children in a very impoverished inner-city neighborhood. And I would often wish that I could just transport them for an hour, so that what they saw when they opened their eyes and looked around them was that kind of beauty that opens so much possibility. So I wonder how this Celtic sensibility would also speak to people who don\u2019t have that kind of beauty at hand. Yeah, an awful lot of urban planning, particularly in poor areas, has doubly impoverished the poor by the ugliness which surrounds them. And it\u2019s understandable that it is so difficult to reach and sustain gentleness there. And I do think, like, a friend of mine, just in the last week, who was absolutely exhausted in London, just came away down to southern England and spent the week by the slow ocean and she\u2019s totally recovered, come back to herself. Right. Yes. But I do think, though, that it\u2019s not just a matter of the outer presence of the landscape. I mean, the dawn goes up and the twilight comes even in the most roughest inner-city place. And I think that connecting to the elemental can be a way of coming into rhythm with the universe. And I do think that there is a way in which the outer presence \u2014 even through memory or imagination \u2014 can be brought inward as a sustaining thing. I mean, I think that \u2014 and it\u2019s the question of beauty, I mean, you\u2019re asking essentially \u2014 as we are speaking, that there are individuals holding out on frontlines, holding the humane tissue alive in areas of ultimate barbarity, where things are visible that the human eye should never see. Right. And they are able to sustain it, because there is in them some kind of sense of beauty that knows the horizon that we are really called to in some way. I love Pascal\u2019s phrase, that you should always \u201Ckeep something beautiful in your mind.\u201D And I have often \u2014 like in times when it\u2019s been really difficult for me, if you can keep some kind of little contour that you can glimpse sideways at now and again, you can endure great bleakness. You know, I\u2019ve been looking back at the thought of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and he has this statement at the beginning of his book The Nature and Destiny of Man, the first line, \u201CMan is his own most vexing problem.\u201D Or I think of a great kind of pivotal work in this culture of modern psychology, M. Scott Peck\u2019s book, which begins, \u201CLife is difficult.\u201D And then I read this line, which begins your book, Anam \u010Aara, which is also a different way of kind of analyzing the human condition: \u201CIt\u2019s strange to be here. The mystery never leaves you.\u201D Talk to me about that as a way of thinking about what it means to be human and how you come to that and what you mean when you write those words. OK. I mean, when you think about language and you think about consciousness, it\u2019s just incredible to think that we can make any sounds that can reach over across to each other at all. Because, I mean, I think we\u2019re \u2014 I think the beauty of being human is that we\u2019re incredibly, intimately near each other. We know about each other, but yet we do not know or never can know what it\u2019s like inside another person. And it\u2019s amazing, here am I sitting in front of you now, looking at your face, you\u2019re looking at mine and yet neither of us have ever seen our own faces. And that in some way, thought is the face that we put on the meaning that we feel and that we struggle with and that the world is always larger and more intense and stranger than our best thought will ever reach. And that\u2019s the mystery of poetry \u2014 is poetry tries to draw alongside the mystery as it\u2019s emerging and somehow bring it into presence and into birth. What do you mean when you write that everyone is an artist? I mean that everyone is involved whether they like it or not in the construction of their world. So, it\u2019s never as given as it actually looks; you are always shaping it and building it. And I feel that from that perspective, that each of us is an artist. Secondly, I believe that everyone has imagination. That no matter how mature and adult and sophisticated a person might seem, that person is still essentially an ex-baby. And as children we all lived in an imaginal world. When you\u2019ve been told don\u2019t cross that wall, \u2019cause there\u2019s monsters over there, my god, the world you would create on the other side of the wall. Right. And when you\u2019d ask questions like why is the sky blue or where does God live or you know all this kind of stuff. Like, one of the first times I was coming to America, I said to my little niece, who was seven, I said, \u201CWhat will I bring you from America?\u201D She said, \u201CUhhhhh.\u201D And her father said, \u201CNo, ask him or you won\u2019t get anything.\u201D And Katy turned to me and said, \u201CWhat\u2019s in it?\u201D Which I thought was a great question about America. So that childlike thing. And secondly, like that, every night when we sleep, we dream, and a dream is a sophisticated, imaginative text, full of figures and drama that we send to ourselves. So I believe that deep in the heart of each of us, there is this imagining, imaginal capacity that we have. So that we are all doing it. And as I read you, I think what you are also saying is that just the act of living, of creating our lives, of growing, moving forward in time is a creative act. Absolutely, it is a creative act, because\u2026 That it is a work of art\u2026 That\u2019s right, because\u2026 \u2026to elevate, to ennoble \u2014 to give ennobling words to something we are doing. That\u2019s right, because the amazing thing about us, I mean, we are so strange and we lose sight actually of how strange we are. I mean, I\u2019m always amazed that you never meet a human \u2014 you meet humans looking for all kinds of things. And you never meet a human and you say to them, \u201CWhat are you looking for on this day?\u201D \u201CI\u2019m looking for yesterday. Where did yesterday go to?\u201D We just take it that it goes into nothingness. And that\u2019s on one side. The other thing of course is that we have no idea what will land on the shoreline of morning tomorrow. So that we are always actively involved in receiving and shaping, you know? You wrote about time: \u201CPossibility is the secret heart of time. On its outer service time is vulnerable to transience. In its deeper heart, time is transfiguration.\u201D I wonder how you are able to have \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I think a larger sense of time, because of \u2014 as an inheritor of \u2014 the Celtic tradition. I have this\u2026 Yeah, I think that\u2019s a bit of it, you know? That old Celtic thing, because, I mean, there is in Ireland, like, still even though it\u2019s getting consumerized so fast. There is still in the west of Ireland, where I live, a sense of time, you know? That there\u2019s time for things. Right. And that when God made time, he made plenty of it, and all the rest of it. And you see, I think that one of the huge difficulties in modern life is the way time has become the enemy. Time is a bully. We\u2019re captive to it. Totally, and I\u2019d say seven out of every ten people who turn up in a doctor\u2019s surgery are suffering from something stress-related. Now, there are big psychological tomes written on stress. But for me, philosophically, stress is a perverted relationship to time. So that rather than being a subject of your own time, you have become its target and victim, and time has become routine. So at the end of the day, you probably haven\u2019t had a true moment for yourself. And to relax in and to just be. Meister Eckhart, whom I love said \u201Cyou know so many people come to me asking how I should pray, how I should think, what I should do, and the whole time they neglect the most important question, which is how should I be?\u201D And I think when you slow it down, then you find your rhythm, and when you come into rhythm, then you come into a different kind of time. Because, you know the way in this country \u2014 there\u2019s all the different zones. I think there are these zones within us as well. There\u2019s surface time, which is really a rapid-fire Ferrari time\u2026 And over-structured. \u2026yeah, over-structured, like, and stolen from you, thieved all the time. And then if you sit down, like, Dan Siegel, my friend, does this lovely meditation: you imagine the surface of the ocean is all restless and then you slip down deep below the surface where it\u2019s still and where things move slower. So, I\u2019m assuming you would suggest that more people need to create more space and stillness but I think what you\u2019re also saying is that simply by thinking differently about time, by approaching it differently \u2014 by putting on a new imagination, we can have a different sense of it. Is that right? That\u2019s absolutely right because I think if you take time not as calendar product, but as actually the parent or mother of presence, then you see in the world of spirit, time behaves differently. I mean when I used to be a priest it was an amazing thing, you\u2019d see someone who would be dying over a week maybe and had lived maybe a hard life where the world had knuckled into themselves. Where they were hard and tight and unyielding and everything had to air and assuage to their center. And suddenly, then, you\u2019d see that within three or four days, you\u2019d see them loosen and you\u2019d see a kind of buried beauty that they\u2019d never allow themselves to enjoy about themselves surface and bring a radiance and spirit to their face. And why did it surface then? Because suddenly there was a recognition that the time was over and that their way of being could no longer help them with this. And that another way of being was being invited from them, and when they yielded to it, it will become transformative and it just means that actually when you change time levels, that something can transform incredibly quickly. I mean I always think that that is the secret of change. That there are huge gestations and fermentations going on in us that we\u2019re not even aware of. And then sometimes when we come to a threshold, crossing over in which we need to become different, that we\u2019ll be able to be different because secret work has been done in us of which we\u2019ve had no inkling. And where did that work come from, who directed that work? What is that? My suspicion would be \u2013 I can\u2019t say who directed that work. But my suspicion is that the soul choreographs one\u2019s biography and one\u2019s destiny. I\u2019ll put it this way to you, in Ireland there\u2019s an indirectness \u2014 I think it was Freud or Jung who said the Irish were un-psychoanalyzable because of all this indirectness. It also comes from our colonial background because you wouldn\u2019t say too much because you could be cut out. And if you say to somebody \u201Chow are you?\u201D they\u2019ll say \u201Coh, not too bad.\u201D And I was always amazed when I came to the land of the free and the home of the exceptionally brave [laughs] that if I put too much sincerity into the question \u201Chow are you?\u201D I could have unleashed a biography in seconds, you know? [laughs] And that you\u2019d get information that you\u2019d never dream of. And it often seems to me here that a person believes that if they tell you their story, that\u2019s who they are. And sometimes these stories are constructed with the most banal second-hand psychological and spiritual cliche, and you look at a beautiful interesting face telling a story that you know doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the life that\u2019s secretly in there. So what I think happens here a bit is that there\u2019s a reduction of identity to biography. And they\u2019re not the same thing. I think biography unfolds identity and makes it visible and puts the mirror of it out there, but I think identity is a more complex thing. And what I love in this regard is my old friend Master Eckhart, the 14th Century mystic\u2026 Right. German mystic. \u2026German mystic. And one day I read in him and he said, \u201CThere is a place in the soul \u2014 there\u2019s a place in the soul that neither time, nor space, nor no created thing can touch.\u201D And I really thought that was amazing, and if you cash it out what it means is that your identity is not equivalent to your biography. And that there is a place in you where you have never been wounded, where there\u2019s still a sureness in you, where there\u2019s a seamlessness in you, and where there is a confidence and tranquility in you. And I think the intention of prayer and spirituality and love is now and again to visit that inner kind of sanctuary. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: the inner landscape of beauty, with the late Irish poet and philosopher John O\u2019Donohue. I think a lot about how in Western culture, and in the United States culture, really important words get watered down and almost ruined and yet we still need them. And \u201Clove\u201D is one of those words. And \u201Cfriendship\u201D I think, may also be a word in which we haven\u2019t \u2014 we struggle to not let our definition of that become impoverished. And just to bring this to a very practical level, some of the things we wring our hands about in our public life, like the disintegration of marriages, the crisis of relationship. And then the implications of that, like how do we raise our children to know what commitment is? And I actually think an impoverished sense of love and of friendship complicates that. I\u2019m asking you this as a philosopher and I think as a wise person. I mean, are we less capable of love and commitment and relationship in a mature sense, in our time than previous generations were? Or is this just a human dilemma that has different details in our time? That\u2019s a very interesting question. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re less capable at all. I think we\u2019re more unpracticed at it and therefore more desperate for it. And I think it\u2019s a matter of attention really, just attention. That if you realize how vital to your whole spirit \u2014 and being and character and mind and health \u2014 friendship actually is, you will take time for it, you know? And the trouble is though for so many of us that we have to be in trouble before we remember what\u2019s essential. And sometimes it\u2019s one of the lonelinesses of humans is that you hold on desperately to things that make you miserable and that sometimes you only realize what you have when you\u2019re almost about to lose it. So, I think that it would be great to step back a little from one\u2019s life and see around one who are those that hold me dear, that truly see me, and those that I need, and to be able to go to them in a different way. Because the amazing thing about humans is we have immense capacity to reawaken in each other the profound ability to be with each other and to be intimate. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve always thought here is that there is loneliness here that is covered over by this fake language of intimacy that you meet everywhere. Right. And that doesn\u2019t have \u2014 you know, everybody will say, \u201CHave a nice day\u201D to you and, you know, you can imagine if you went \u2014 turned back to them and said, \u201CGod, I really wonder if I\u2019ll have a nice day or what the day will be like,\u201D things could get complicated very suddenly, you know? And I think this is one of the key things in parenting and the difficulty of raising children in a very, very fast-moving culture \u2014 that again it\u2019s the difficulty of creating a space where children can actually unfold and where they can be truly accompanied in their journey. Because I think young kids now in adolescence are going through huge, huge question zones that when we were young we didn\u2019t go through. And sometimes it\u2019s very lonesome to watch how distant parents feel from them, because of their incapacity to somehow hold conversations with them that really need to happen. I think something else that\u2019s connected to all of this that we\u2019re not very self-aware about in this culture is the connection between our interior lives and our exterior appearance, not just physical appearance, but how we conduct our lives in the light of expectations, and I think that is something that you write about again that we just aren\u2019t attentive towards. Yeah, I feel like in the book I wrote on beauty, I was trying to say that one of the huge confusions in our times is to mistake glamour for beauty. Yes. And we do live in a culture which is very addicted to the image, and I think that there is always an uncanny symmetry between the way you are inward with yourself and the way you are outward. And I feel that there is an evacuation of interiority going on in our times. And that we need to draw back inside ourselves and that we\u2019ll find immense resources there. When you say symmetry, I don\u2019t think you mean that \u2014 that there\u2019s an equality, but that they are intimately connected. They\u2019re intimately \u2014 yeah that\u2019s precisely, yep. We\u2019re putting our energy outward; it\u2019s taking something from inside us. Right. It\u2019s taking something \u2014 exactly that\u2019s exactly what I mean. That it\u2019s taking something from inside and we\u2019re secretly debilitating ourselves. And it\u2019s understandable too. Because if you look at the educational system and you look at most of the public fora in our culture, there is very little time or attention given to what you could almost call learning the art of inwardness or a pedagogy of interiority. Right. That\u2019s why I find the aesthetic things like poetry, fiction, good film, theater, drama, dance, and music actually awaken that inside you. And remind you that there is a huge interiority within you. Like, for instance when I came in to New York last Thursday evening and checked into the hotel, I found out that there was a Tchaikovsky concert on in the Lincoln center. And I went over there and I got a ticket, like one of the last tickets, which was two rows in the front, and I\u2019d never been so near an orchestra. And I said, \u201CMy god, I\u2019m too near.\u201D Then I watched them, and all the rest of it. But I knew, why I was given the ticket then, at the end, because it was Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto in D, and Lorin Maazel came out to conduct it. And then this beautiful violinist, Janine Jansen, a Dutch violinist, it was her debut in New York. And she played this, it was just unbelievable. I cried. Like, after the first movement, people spontaneously stood up and went to give her a standing ovation, and she just held it. And we all went back again into our seats. And then at the end, people were just blown away, because an event, an aesthetic event had happened. This is a complicated piece of music everywhere \u2014 she was playing a Stradivarius from 1727. Everywhere she went on this violin she got exactly what she was looking for, she held it and Maazel was so sovereign and so \u2014 you know like a huge patriarch. And three or four times \u2014 I was up close enough to see them \u2014 he looked at her with a wistful, proud gentleness of a grandfather. And there was this woman, this beautiful slim body, and you could almost see the music hurting her even when she wasn\u2019t playing. So it was a huge, and like everybody \u2014 and there were hardened New York critics there \u2014 but everybody was so touched. And I think that is the magnificence of beauty, is that even in landscapes of controlled, corrugated categories, you can be swept off your feet by just beauty. The late Irish poet and philosopher John O\u2019Donohue. This is the Dutch violinist he just mentioned, Janine Jansen, playing another piece by Tchaikovsky, \u201CSwan Lake.\u201D Coming up: where soul and beauty might fit into modern work \u2014 and the unusual emotional power of Celtic music. \u201CMusic,\u201D John O\u2019Donohue said, \u201Cis what language would love to be if it could.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring the inner landscape of beauty, a notion of the late Irish poet and philosopher John O\u2019Donohue. I interviewed him just before his death in 2008. John O\u2019Donohue often wrote about beauty. He believed that the human soul does not merely hunger for beauty, but that we feel most alive in the presence of what is beautiful. \u201CIt returns us often in fleeting but sustaining moments,\u201D he said, \u201Cto our highest selves.\u201D You also suggest in your book about beauty that beauty can be a kind of antidote even to our most pressing global crises. How do you think of beauty as relevant in that sense? Yeah, I think it\u2019s not just relevant like but I think it\u2019s actually necessary because I think that beauty is not a luxury, but I think that it ennobles the heart and reminds us of the infinity that is within us. I always loved what Mandela said when he came out, and I was actually in his cell in Robben Island, one time I was in South Africa. Even after 27 years in confinement for wrong you never committed, he turned himself into a huge priest and come out with this sentence where he said, \u201CYou know that what we are afraid of is not so much our limitations but the infinite within us.\u201D And I think that that is in everybody. And I suppose the question that\u2019s at the heart of all we\u2019ve been discussing really, which is a beautiful question, is the question of God, you know? And I think that one of the reasons that so many people turn away from religion in our times is that the God question has died for them, because the question has been framed in such repetitive dead language. And I think it\u2019s the exciting question, once you awaken to the presence of God. Well, you have said, you write, \u201CGod is Beauty.\u201D Yeah, I have, yeah. Did you always feel this? Is that something \u2014 is that a sense that has grown in you or something that you name now? It\u2019s a sense that has grown in me. I suppose, that I\u2019ve always kind of had the intuition about it, because I feel that there are two ways that you must always keep together in approaching the God thing. One is, and this is what I like about the Christian tradition \u2014 and this is where I diverge a little from the Buddhist tradition even though I love Buddhism as a methodology to clean up the mind and get you into purity of presence. What I love is that at the heart of Christianity, you have this idea of intimacy, which is true belonging, being seen, the ultimate home of individuation, the ultimate source of it and the homecoming. That\u2019s what I call spirituality, the art of homecoming. So it\u2019s St. Augustine\u2019s phrase, \u201CDeus intimior intimo meo\u201D \u2014 \u201CGod is more intimate to me than I am to myself.\u201D Then you go to Meister Eckhart, and you get the other side of it, which you must always keep together with it, where in Middle High German, he says, \u201CGott wirt und Gott entwirt\u201D \u2014 that means, \u201CGod becomes and God un-becomes,\u201D or translated it means that God is only our name for it, and the closer we get to it the more it ceases to be God. So then you are on a real safari\u2026 Right. \u2026with the wildness and danger and otherness of God. And I think when you begin to get a sense of the depth that is there, then your whole heart wakens up. I mean, I love Irenaeus\u2019 thing from the second century, which said, the Glory of the human being \u2014 \u201CThe glory of God is the human being fully alive.\u201D And I think in our culture that one of the things that we are missing is that these thresholds where we can encounter this, and where we move into new change in our lives, there are no rituals to help us to recognize them or to cross them worthily. And you know \u201Cthreshold\u201D is a word you use a great deal in your book on beauty as well. It is, yeah. And what is that relationship between beauty and thresholds? Well, I think that the threshold, if you go back to the etymology of the word \u201Cthreshold,\u201D it comes from \u201Cthreshing,\u201D which is to separate the grain from the husk. So the threshold, in a way, is a place where you move into more critical and challenging and worthy fullness. And I think there are huge thresholds in every life. I mean, I think, you know that, for instance, I\u2019d like to give a very simple example of it is, that if you are in the middle of your life in a busy evening, 50 things to do and you get a phone call that somebody you love is suddenly dying. Takes ten seconds to communicate that information, but when you put the phone down, you are already standing in a different world. \u2018Cause suddenly everything that seems so important before is all gone and now you are thinking of this. So the given world that we think is there and the solid ground we are on is so tentative. And I think a threshold is a line which separates two territories of spirit, and I think that very often how we cross is the key thing. And where is beauty in that? Where beauty is \u2014 I think is beauty \u2014 beauty isn\u2019t all about just nice, loveliness like. Beauty is about more rounded substantial becoming. And I think when we cross a new threshold that if we cross worthily, what we do is we heal the patterns of repetition that were in us that had us caught somewhere. And in our crossing then we cross on to new ground where we just don\u2019t repeat what we\u2019ve been through in the last place we were. So I think beauty in that sense is about an emerging fullness, a greater sense of grace and elegance, a deeper sense of depth, and also a kind of homecoming for the enriched memory of your unfolding life. I want to ask you, I think right when we began to talk about beauty, you rightly said that in this culture we tend to associate beauty with glamour. And I think if you just mention the word, if you just threw it into a commonplace conversation, someone might just think of a beautiful face, of a famous beautiful face, right? I want to ask you, when you think of the word \u201Cbeauty,\u201D what pictures come into your mind? When I think of the word \u201Cbeauty,\u201D some of the faces of those that I love come into my mind. When I think of beauty I also think of beautiful landscapes that I know. Then I think of acts of such lovely kindness that have been done to me, by people that cared for me, in bleak unsheltered times or when I needed to be loved and minded. I also think of those unknown people who are the real heroes for me, who you never hear about, who hold out on lines \u2014 on frontiers of awful want and awful situations and manage somehow to go beyond the given impoverishment and offer gifts of possibility and imagination and seeing. I also think \u2014 always when I think of beauty \u2014 \u2019cause it\u2019s so beautiful for me \u2014 is I think of music. I love music. I think music is just it. I mean, I think that\u2019s \u2014 I love poetry as well, of course, and I think of beauty in poetry. But I always think that music is what language would love to be if it could, you know? And\u2026 Right. I have to say that I discovered Celtic music, you know, after going to that part of the world, Scotland especially. And Celtic music for me has this completely, you can say this about Beethoven as well, but in a very particular way, it seems to express the greatest joy and also the deepest sorrow, almost indistinguishable from each other and yet both with a kind of healing force. I \u2014 can\u2019t even put words around what I \u2026 That\u2019s beautiful what you\u2019ve said though, because I think there is that. One of the things I\u2019m always amazed about Irish music, for instance, is how in some way the lines of the landscape find their way into the music, the memory of the landscape almost, the memory of the people too. And that in some sense despite the sorrow that we\u2019ve endured, and I mean Ireland \u2014 it\u2019s not fashionable to say it now, Ireland has hundreds of years of an awful history of suffering. And I feel that you hear that in the music of Ireland. You hear it in the music, you do. Even in \u2026 Even in the fast music and the light, gay music. \u2026 the celebratory \u2014 Yes. Yes. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. You hear it there, you hear the undertones and the quiet spaces where the echo of this hauntedness comes through. And yet it is absolutely linked with \u2014 see joy doesn\u2019t even do it either with this. It doesn\u2019t. Exuberance. Yeah, there\u2019s an exuberance or a vitality. Yes. There\u2019s some kind of vitality. And I know friends of mine, who play you know, and when they play they\u2019re unreachable, you can\u2019t find them, you know? They\u2019re totally \u2014 they\u2019re serving the music. They\u2019re just in another place. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today revisiting my conversation with the late Irish poet and philosopher John O\u2019Donohue. In the last years of his life, he became a well-known speaker on leadership and creativity in the corporate sector. He consulted with executives on integrating a sense of soul and of beauty into their leadership and their imagination about the people with whom they work. I would like to hear about the work you do in corporations and workplaces. It seems to me, in a strange way some of the most \u2014 the greatest intimacy and community we have or fail to have is with our colleagues at work. And because we spend so much time at work and it so defines us, our souls, the light and darkness of our souls, is on display at work. And yet there\u2019s a real question about how do we honor that sort of in ourselves and in others and remain professional. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you get at in your work with corporations, but that\u2019s kind of on my mind. I think you are right, I mean, we spend over one-third of our lives actually in the workplace, and one of the loneliest things you can find is somebody who is in the wrong kind of work, who shouldn\u2019t be doing what they are doing but should be doing something else and haven\u2019t the courage to get up and leave it and make a new possibility for themselves. But it\u2019s lovely when you find someone at work who\u2019s doing exactly what they dreamed they should be doing and whose work is an expression of their inner gift. And in witnessing to that gift and bringing it out they actually provide an incredible service to us all. And I think you see that the gifts that are given to us as individuals are not for us alone, or for our own self-improvement, but they are actually for the community and to be offered. And I think this is where leadership comes in at work. And that\u2019s why I think good, wise leadership will be attuned to the vitality of a true ethos and helping to establish it. And are you finding that there is great interest and curiosity and willingness to have this new kind of imagination in workplaces. I really think \u2014 yeah, I really think there is, because I think in most workplaces there is huge imagination anyway but it\u2019s usually practical imagination. There\u2019s dedication to productivity and looking at the bottom line. And I think then when they stand back a little and see that the spirit and soul dimensions are not kind of luxury items but are actually the very origins and sources which will enable everything to flow and unfold in a new way, that then they realize that the invisible world is a secret hidden resource that can be released and excavated for the huge resources of spirit, guidance, for areas of ourselves that we\u2019ve forgotten. You know, in many cultures in the West, in Europe and in the United States, there are controversies about where are the boundaries between religion and politics and that\u2019s a complicated discussion that is quite stress-filled. But what I sense and what, you know, I\u2019m talking about on my program, many weeks in different forms is that there is parallel discussion happening that there is a spiritual aspect to human life and that that is essential. I wonder how you would speak to address some of the fear that arises. Because in the American imagination, for example, those things get confused. And someone might listen to you talking about \u2014 being in a board room and talking about the soul \u2014 why is that not something that we should be afraid of? Or that really even has anything to do with our rules about church and state, or about the line between politics and religion? I think your question is absolutely, perfectly poised. Because first of all, to respond directly, I think there should be a fear of mixing up religion and politics and money. I love that Greek phrase, \u201Ceternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\u201D Now the second thing is that, of course, it\u2019s a huge naivety for any organization, or any group or culture to \u2014 and it\u2019s actually unscholarly \u2014 to believe that a religion, as the locus of the wisdom, and the lived spirit experience of a people, is a naive empty mass. It\u2019s a huge resource. And the best minds and the most critical minds know that. Like the word \u201Csoul\u201D comes from the religious tradition and the philosophic tradition, and one of the sad things here often is that it\u2019s used as a bland receptacle for the tired energies of psychology. But if you go back at \u201Csoul\u201D and you look at the depth and the fire that\u2019s in it, it\u2019s a dangerous thing to have a soul. And, I think for parenting, for relationships, and for all the domains of our endeavor and work, to have access to a religious tradition is a huge strengthening, critical resource, which keeps you wide awake and makes you ask yourself the hard questions. Like, I\u2019ve always thought that tradition is to the community what memory is to the individual. And if you lose your memory, you wake up in the morning, you don\u2019t know where you are, who you are, what ground your standing on. And if you lose your tradition, it\u2019s the same thing. And I mean\u2026 And tradition, like memory, has dark passages and\u2026 Oh, it has huge dark passages, and I mean, I would say that within the Christian tradition there are dark zones of complete horror. But the weight of it is\u2026 \u2026but the weight of it \u2014 and there are also zones of great light and immense wells of refreshment and healing. And I think it\u2019s a critical question in all of us, for somebody that wants to have a mature adult, open-ended, good hearted critical faith, to conduct the most vigorous and relentless conversation that you can with your own tradition. It was actually in your book that I first realized, and I had never thought about this, that the root \u2014 the Greek root for the word \u201Cbeauty\u201D is related to the word for calling. That\u2019s right. Kalon, kalein. That\u2019s it exactly. That\u2019s fascinating. It is actually. And it means that actually in the presence of beauty. It\u2019s not a neutral thing, but it\u2019s actually calling you, you know? And I feel that one could write a wonderful psychology just based on the notion of being called, you know, being called to be yourself and called to transfigure what has hardened or got wounded with in you. And it\u2019s also, of course, the heart of creativity this calling forth all the time, because like in the work that I do trying to write a few poems, you never write the same poem twice. You know, you are always at a new place. And then you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re suddenly surprised by where you get taken to, you know? But if we think, as you\u2019ve suggested, as beauty as relevant to some of the most troubling problems in our world and in ourselves, how do we pursue that calling, given the limitations, given that a lot of what is around us is not visibly, objectively beautiful and may not be? Absolutely, and that\u2019s a very fair question. And you know it\u2019s like in old notions of growth and development there was always this idea, as Noel Hanlon, a poet friend of mine says, you know, in a poem about her daughter, \u201CLike me you needed something to push against\u201D \u2014 that somehow we needed something to push against in order to grow. Now there is almost a feeling like as that growth should be delivered to us. And I think that from the way you state it is that it\u2019s a recognition. That there is this dialectic there, that around us the forces are not kind in terms of either recognizing, awakening, or encouraging beauty, but that actually, they should be the impetus and the spur to do it. Now how do we do it? One way, and I think this is a really lovely way, and I think it\u2019s an interesting question to ask oneself too. And the question is: when is the last time that you had a great conversation, a conversation which wasn\u2019t just two intersecting monologues, which is what passes for conversation a lot in this culture. But when had you last a great conversation, in which you overheard yourself saying things that you never knew you knew? That you heard yourself receiving from somebody words that absolutely found places within you that you thought you had lost and a sense of an event of a conversation that brought the two of you on to a different plane. And then fourthly, a conversation that continued to sing in your mind for weeks afterwards. And I\u2019ve had some of them recently, and it\u2019s just absolutely amazing, as we would say at home, they are food and drink for the soul. Second thing, I think a question to always, ask oneself, who are you reading? Who are you reading? And where are you stretching your own boundaries? Are you repetitive in that? And one of the first books I read as a child \u2014 we had no books at home, but a neighbor of ours had all these books and he brought loads of books, that\u2019s how I ruined my eyes and I have to wear glasses. But one of the first books I read was a book by Willie Sutton, the bank robber, who was doing 30 years for robbing banks. And in the book somebody asked Willie, and they said, \u201CWillie why do you rob banks?\u201D And Willie said, \u201C\u2018Cause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201D And, why do we read books? \u2018Cause that\u2019s where the wisdom is. So like, my professors in colleges always use to say, if you were doing an essay or doing a thesis, you know, the first thing you have to do is read the primary sources and trust your own encounter with them before you go to the secondary literature. And I\u2019d say to anybody who is listening to us, who is interested in spirituality and who is maybe being coaxed a little away from believing it\u2019s all a naive, doomed, illusion-ridden thing, pick up something like Meister Eckhart or some one of the mystics and just have a look at it, and you can be surprised what an exciting adventure and homecoming it could become. John O\u2019Donohue died in his sleep on January 3rd, 2008, at the age of 52. This was one of the last interviews he gave. His books include Anam \u010Aara and Beauty. His final work, which was published posthumously, is called, To Bless the Space Between Us: A Book of Blessings. And here in closing, is one of his well-known poems of blessing, which he wrote for his mother at the time of his father\u2019s death. He read it aloud to me when we sat together. This is a poem I wrote several years ago, and it\u2019s called, \u201CBeannacht,\u201D which is the Gaelic word for blessing: On the day when The weight deadens On your shoulders And you stumble, May the clay dance To balance you. And when your eyes Freeze behind The gray window And the ghost of loss Gets in to you, May a flock of colors, Indigo, red, green, And azure blue, Come to awaken in you A meadow of delight. When the canvas frays In the curragh of thought And a stain of ocean Blackens beneath you, May there come across the waters A path of yellow moonlight To bring you safely home. May the nourishment of the earth be yours, May the clarity of light be yours, May the fluency of the ocean be yours, May the protection of the ancestors be yours. And so may a slow Wind work these words Of love around you, An invisible cloak To mind your life."
