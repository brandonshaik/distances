  "fullText": "Pico Iyer is not a spiritual teacher or even, he says, a spiritual person per se. But he has become one of our most beloved and eloquent translators of the modern rediscovery of inner life. As a journalist and novelist, he travels the globe from Ethiopia to North Korea, and he lives in Japan. But he also experiences a remote Benedictine hermitage as his second home, retreating there many times each year. In this intimate conversation, we explore the \u201Cart of stillness\u201D he practices \u2014 not in order to enrich the mountaintop, he writes, \u201Cbut to bring calm into the motion of the world.\u201D I got out of my car at this monastery, and the air was pulsing. And it was very silent, but really the silence wasn\u2019t the absence of noise, it was almost the presence of these transparent walls that I think the monks had worked very, very hard to make available to us in the world. And somehow, almost immediately, it was as if a huge heaviness fell away from me, and the lens cap came off my eyes. Really almost instantaneously I felt I\u2019ve stepped into a richer, deeper life, a real life that I\u2019d half forgotten had existed. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Pico Iyer studied at Eton, Oxford and Harvard. He had an early successful career as a journalist with Time magazine in New York City. But he left and moved to Japan to create a modest, quiet, nearly-technology free life. Among his many books, he\u2019s explored the literary icon Graham Greene, and authored what I think is the most searching and intimate existing portrait of the Dalai Lama. Pico Iyer still lives in Japan with his wife when he\u2019s not on the road, chronicling what he calls the \u201Cglobal soul.\u201D You have such an interesting background, your parents were from India. You were born and grew up in England and the U.S. Your father was a philosopher and your mother was also thinking about philosophy and religion. I was really intrigued to learn that your first name, which you don\u2019t use in your writing, is Siddharth, which is based in part on the Buddha\u2019s first name. Exactly. And of course, I didn\u2019t realize until well into my 40s that I have the sort of perfect global name and the name that has fit my destiny because\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026as you say, my first name is the name of the Buddha. And my second name, Pico \u2014 my parents, as philosophers, named me after the great Renaissance Catholic heretic Pico della Mirandola from Italy. And my third name is my father\u2019s name, Raghavan, which is a good Hindu name. And my fourth name sort of shows that I come from a lineage of south Indian priests. And so actually \u2014 and my father was a Theosophist, so in my four names, I have four religious traditions. It\u2019s wonderful. So I mean, how would you describe, if you would describe, the spiritual sensibility that you absorbed in your early life with your parents? I would say it was very diverse. And, of course, like any child, I didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time, not until much later. But both my parents were teaching philosophy at Oxford University when I was a little boy, and so I would come back from kindergarten and there would be Tibetan monks in the room sent by the Dalai Lama to learn Western philosophy from my Indian father to complement the Tibetan philosophy they had learned. And of course, there were all the great myths and enchantments of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and the Indian stories that my parents passed on to me at bedtime. And the other aspect was that both my parents had grown up in British India in Bombay, and so they were steeped in Shakespeare, English poetry, and the Bible. And in fact, to this day, my 83-year-old mother lives in the hills of California, she always dresses in a sari, and when occasionally a missionary will pay a visit to her house and say, \u201CExcuse me, ma\u2019am. Have you ever read the Bible?\u201D My sari-clad mother can recite the Bible backwards and forwards. She knows it better than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. So I was \u2014 later I realized what a blessing to grow up in the midst of all these traditions. Yes. And I think you know what I\u2019m describing when I say that you are an intellectual, you were always an intellectual, and there\u2019s one place in your writing where you refer to \u201Call the institutions of higher skepticism\u201D to which your father had sent you. So that\u2019s also very defining. I wonder if you were always interested in what you now refer to as the inner world. And what I mean by that is did you take it seriously as an intellectual? I\u2019ve got to confess to you \u2014 I think of intellectual \u2014 my prejudice is almost to think of it as a bad word or a dirty word. And I think that everything important in my life has not come through my mind, but through my spirit or my being or my heart. Everything I trust, whether it\u2019s the people I love or the values I cherish or the places that have moved me, have come at some much deeper level than the mind. And I sometimes think the mind makes lots of complications over what is a much more beautiful and transparent encounter with the world. So I suppose I\u2019ve tried to run away from everything I associate with the intellect. And I\u2019m very grateful for the great institutions which trained me a lot and, in fact, in some ways, enabled me to do without them and to get rid of them. I think you have to explore that world before you can turn your back on it or turn your back on it or close a door on it. But, really, I hope the heart of my last 30 years as an adult has been about moving towards those things I can\u2019t explain and that reason can\u2019t begin to do justice to. Mm-hmm. And I feel like, as an essayist and as a travel writer, as a novelist as well, you kind of are a cartographer, an observer, as well as a participant in this \u2014 I would say \u2014 the rediscovery of the inner world, both in yourself but also in the world at large. And it runs all the way through your writing, kind of finding people everywhere in unexpected places, exploring this part of life with a new kind of vigor and a new integrity, I think. Well, thank you so much. I mean, that is a great compliment, and I will accept that even if I don\u2019t accept intellectual. OK. And you\u2019re right. I mean, I think it\u2019s quite conscious in me that as a little boy, as you said, I grew up traveling a lot because \u2014 first being born to Indian parents in England, and then we moved to California when I was 7. And in those days, it was actually cheaper to continue getting my education in England and flying back to my parents in the holidays than to go to the local private schools. So from the time I was 9, I was living on planes and flying across the North Pole to school by myself. And then when I was loose upon the world in the 20s, I quickly, literally tried to map the world and to see as many places as possible and try to take in \u2014 I always remembered that I felt I was almost a part of the first generation ever to be able to wake up one morning and to be in Tibet or Bolivia or Yemen the next day. My grandparents couldn\u2019t have imagined that. Right. And I thought this is an opportunity I don\u2019t want to squander, so I travelled a lot. It\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s worth pausing every once in a while and taking in, isn\u2019t it? I mean, no one ever says that, but it\u2019s so true, this huge \u2014 this dramatic change in our lifetime. Yes, which we quickly take for granted and also the dramatic change that goes with it, that my grandparents almost had their home in their community and their tribe and their religion handed to them at birth, whereas I felt that I could, in some ways, create my own, which is a challenge, but it was a beautiful opportunity. And at some point, I thought, well, I\u2019ve been really lucky to see many, many places. Now, the great adventure is the inner world that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time gathering emotions, impressions, and experiences. Now, I just want to sit still for years on end, really, charting that inner landscape because I think anybody who travels knows that you\u2019re not really doing so in order to move around \u2014 you\u2019re travelling in order to be moved. And really what you\u2019re seeing is not just the Grand Canyon or the Great Wall but some moods or intimations or places inside yourself that you never ordinarily see when you\u2019re sleepwalking through your daily life. And so I thought there\u2019s this great undiscovered terrain that Henry David Thoreau and Thomas Merton and Emily Dickinson fearlessly investigated, and I want to follow in their footsteps. Yes. And I feel like those kinds of figures who have investigated this fearlessly across the ages are \u2014 have been your companions. And it also seems \u2014 the language you just used about \u2014 that we\u2019re the first generation to kind of create our own place in the world and be where we want to be \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re also \u2014 and I think you\u2019re part of this \u2014 and I guess I\u2019m part of this too \u2014 where we\u2019re also \u2014 this is the first generation where human beings don\u2019t inherit their religious identity, their spiritual identity, where modern people are actually crafting these things on their own. Exactly. And I think about that too as something so new. Yes, which \u2014 we\u2019re really on uncharted ground in that regard. So that was just what I was thinking as I was saying that, that on the one hand I was lucky to be the beneficiary of, maybe, four religious traditions when I was growing up. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t have one. And to some extent, perhaps my whole life is going to be about making some kind of rigorous, useful collage of the many traditions I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be exposed to and seeing how each can shed light on the other. But I don\u2019t have the radiant clarity and certainty of many people whom I admire, who were born into a tradition and know from the first day that that is where they belong. I find it very interesting that you have really devoted yourself to this subject of the inner world, inner life \u2014 spiritual life. But you\u2019ve repeatedly written that you have never been tempted to take up a spiritual \u2014 formal spiritual practices yourself, that you don\u2019t meditate, you don\u2019t attend services. Is that still true? Have you never \u2014 even writing a book about the Dalai Lama \u2014 that you haven\u2019t tried meditation? It\u2019s embarrassing, but it\u2019s true. No, that\u2019s\u2026 I watch \u2014 my wife wakes up every morning at 5:00 a.m. and meditates, and I lie in bed, watch her meditating, and then collapse in a heap. I do it vicariously through her. But you mentioned the Dalai Lama, and I think that\u2019s part \u2014 I spent \u2014 I\u2019ve been lucky enough to know the Dalai Lama since I was a teenager, and I travel with him across Japan every year. And I think spending a lot of time with a man of that degree of spiritual seriousness and devotion has taught me what a serious solemn undertaking it is. And I don\u2019t want to be presumptuous and to claim to a religious tradition until I\u2019ve earned it. And I think seeing somebody like the Dalai Lama or even the sometimes Zen monk, Leonard Cohen, I see what hard work it is and how many years go into their feeling worthy of calling themselves a Buddhist in those instances. And my Catholic monk friends teach me the same lesson. And as you know, the Dalai Lama, in response to the global times that you and I have been discussing, when he comes to this country, will always tell people, \u201CPlease don\u2019t become a Buddhist. Stay within your own traditions where your roots are deepest. You can learn some things from Buddhists, Buddhists can learn something from you. But don\u2019t too hastily abandon the centuries of tradition sent down you and grab something you don\u2019t perhaps imperfectly understand. And I think he brings us back to that wonderful truth, which is also maybe a feature of this age, which is that when a Buddhist and a Christian have a really deep conversation, the Buddhist becomes a better Buddhist the Christian becomes a better Christian. Right. And just while I think of it, when you asked me, as so many of my friends do, why I don\u2019t meditate. If my wife were here, she would fall around laughing and say, \u201CKrista, all this guy ever does is meditate.\u201D Just because I\u2019m a writer. And so she sees me, I wake up, I have breakfast, I make a five foot commute to my desk, and then I just sit there for at least five hours trying to sift through my distortions and illusions and projections and find what is real behind the many things I\u2019m tempted to say. And I think a writer is in the blessed position because, in some ways, our job is to sit still and to meditate for a living. So although I don\u2019t have a formal spiritual meditation practice, I do spend much of my life in the middle of nowhere, stationary. And I\u2019m really grateful for that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with essayist, novelist, and travel writer Pico Iyer. You\u2019ve given a name to this life you lead, to what \u2014 I agree \u2014 I would call a contemplative practice, which is stillness. And I think it\u2019s such a wonderful way that you\u2019ve injected that word in your writing and kind of into our cultural discourse. I mean, I wonder, can you trace when you started to name this, to use that word to name this impulse in you in that way? I think I can very distinctly. As I said, I\u2019ve always traveled a lot, and even in my 30s, I noticed I\u2019d already accumulated one million miles on a single United States airline. So I realized I have a lot of movement in my life, but not maybe enough stillness. And around that same time, our family house in Santa Barbara burned to the ground, and I lost everything I had in the world. I bought a toothbrush from an all night supermarket that evening, and that was the only thing I had the next day. And so I was unusually footloose. And a friend who was a school teacher recommended that I go and spend a few days in a Catholic hermitage. And although I am not Catholic, and although I am not a hermit, he told me that he always took his classes there and even the most distracted, restless, testosterone-addled adolescent boy felt calmer and clearer when he went there. So I thought anything that works for an adolescent boy ought to work for me. And I got in my car, and I drove north along the coast following the sea, and the road got narrower and narrower, and then I came to an even narrower barely paved road that snaked up for two miles to the top of a mountain. And I got out of my car at this monastery, and the air was pulsing. And it was very silent, but really the silence wasn\u2019t the absence of noise, it was almost the presence of these transparent walls that I think the monks had worked very, very hard to make available to us in the world. And I stepped into the little room where I was going to stay, and it was simple. But there was a bed and a long desk, and above the desk a long picture window, and outside it a walled garden with a chair, and beyond that just this great blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean. And somehow, almost immediately, it was as if a huge heaviness fell away from me, and the lens cap came off my eyes. And suddenly, I was seeing everything from great immediacy and it was almost as if little Pico had disappeared and the whole world had come in to me instead. And, I remember a Blue Jay suddenly alighted on the fence outside my window, and I watched it rapt as if it was the most miraculous thing that had happened. And then bells began ringing above, and it felt like they were ringing inside me. And then when darkness fell, I just walked along the monastery road under the stars, watching the taillights of cars disappear round the headlands to the south. And really almost instantaneously I felt I\u2019ve stepped into a richer, deeper life, a real life that I had half forgotten had existed. One thing I noticed was when I was driving up, like many of us, I was conducting all kinds of conversations or arguments in my head, and I was feeling guilty about leaving my mother behind, and I was worried that my bosses wouldn\u2019t be able to find me for three days. And as soon as I arrived in that place, I realized that none of that mattered and that, really, by being here, I would have so much more to offer my mother and my friends and my bosses. The last thing I\u2019ll say about this is that nowadays when I visit my mother, she lives in the hills of California at exactly the same elevation as the monastery \u2014 1200 feet, and she enjoys a beautiful view over the Pacific Ocean. And to anybody looking at her house, they would say it\u2019s the last word in tranquility and seclusion. But of course, when I\u2019m at home, if ever I\u2019m tempted to read a book, a part of me is braced for the phone to ring or the chime of \u201Cyou\u2019ve got mail\u201D in the next room. So I interrupt myself even if it doesn\u2019t interrupt me. And if ever I\u2019m tempted to look at the stars, I think, oh no, there are a thousand things I have to do around the house or around the town. Or if I\u2019m involved in a deep conversation, I think, oh, the Lakers game is on T.V. I should do that. And so one way or another, I always cut into my own clarity and concentration when I\u2019m at home. And it reminded me why sometimes people like me have to take conscious measures to step into the stillness and silence and be reminded of how it washes us clean, really. Was that the same Benedictine hermitage that you go to now, that you spend time at every year? Absolutely. So I\u2019ve been going now for 24 years, I\u2019ve stayed there more than 70 times. And I really think that\u2019s my secret home. And in a world of change and sometimes impermanence, that, along with my wife and my mother, are really the still point of my world. And wherever I\u2019m traveling in the world, I have the image of that little room with the Pacific below it in my head and the chapel there too. And I feel that really steadies and grounds me in the way I need in a world of tumult. And I think that\u2019s such an important point because as you pursued that place of stillness that you found both physically and inside yourself, you know, it seems to me, you\u2019ve held that in a creative tension with moving back out into the world and with movement. I mean, here\u2019s something beautiful you wrote, that \u201Cthe point of gathering stillness is not to enrich the sanctuary or the mountaintop, but to bring that calm into the motion, the commotion of the world.\u201D We haven\u2019t used the word \u201Cspirituality\u201D yet, um, you make the same connection when you write explicitly about spirituality, you know, that it arises out of the disjunction between us and the transcendent. I mean, spirituality is in some kind of tension with stillness, right? That, in fact, this is the place where we meet our demons as well. I feel like that\u2019s there in your writing. Yes. Beautiful. No, I absolutely agree with that. And I think sometimes \u201Cmystery\u201D is a word I use as an equivalent to spirituality. But you\u2019re right. I think our relation with the Divine is a love affair, and it\u2019s a passionate love affair, and it\u2019s also as tumultuous as any affair that we have in the world with somebody we care about a lot. And so it\u2019s not all sweetness and light and probably shouldn\u2019t be because the sufferings and the demons are often what instructs us much more than the calm radiant moments. And so I love people like Thomas Merton because, half the time he\u2019s in his hermitage, he\u2019s chafing against it, he\u2019s knocking against the walls, he\u2019s longing to be out in the world, and he\u2019s honest enough to say that \u2014 as you said \u2014 the electricity comes in the tension and that there\u2019s there\u2019s no sense of light without a darkness and without a dark night of the soul. I once spent some time in Iceland in the middle of the summer when the sun doesn\u2019t set for 90 days and nights, so it\u2019s always light out. And it was very disorienting. I had lost all sense of when to eat, when to sleep, when to dream. And it was a tiny physical reminder that we need that cycle of light and dark. And you know, that so nuances this kind of simplified characterizations that we sometimes have about religion. I mean, I agree with you that theology and spiritual practice and religious traditions are all about the complexity of the human condition, but that doesn\u2019t find expression so much in popular culture. You know, I \u2014 a couple of years ago, after you published your book about Graham Greene, I went to a conversation you had with Paul Holdengraber at the New York Public Library. Do you remember that? I do. I wish I\u2019d known you were there. I know. But yes. I remember it well. I was there. I was there. Because I had started reading you, and you said something that night that I have just been \u2014 all these years \u2014 been looking forward to the day when I would be able to discuss it with you. Wonderful. I think Paul may have asked you the question that, you know, is always out there: what is the difference between spirituality and religion? And you said \u2014 I believe you said this \u2014 that spirituality is water, and religion is the tea. I wondered if, what if spirituality is water, and religion is the cup, you know, which carries it forward, although it may be flawed, and we may drop it and break it. I don\u2019t know, what do you think about that? No, I love that notion of the cup. And if you had just asked me that question now, I would say that spirituality is \u2014 as we were just saying \u2014 the story of our passionate affair with what is deepest inside us and with the candle that\u2019s always flickering inside us and sometimes almost seems to go out and sometimes blazes. And religion is the community, the framework, the tradition, all the other people into which we bring what we find in solitude. So in some ways, I would say very much exactly the thing that you just said. And I should also say when \u2014 if I talked about water and tea, I was probably stealing from the Dalai Lama because what he often say that the most important thing without which we can\u2019t live is kindness. We need that to survive. And he says kindness is water, religion is like tea. Oh, OK. It\u2019s a great luxury. It increases the savor of life. It\u2019s wonderful if you have it. But you can survive without tea, you can\u2019t survive without water. OK. And so everyday kindness and responsibility is the starting block for every life. So I might have been alluding to him there, but it\u2019s a nice reminder to ground ourselves in the people around us before we start thinking about our texts and our notions of the absolute. I mean, it\u2019s so interesting to me, thinking about you going and being with those Benedictines year after year, and how, in fact, that\u2019s an experience so many people are having now. I mean, I grew up Protestant, and I think the monastics were \u2014 it\u2019s not something I knew about, and when I learned about it as I grew older, it baffled me. And I remember somebody explaining to me that the people who gave themselves over to monastic existence are devoting themselves to prayer and contemplation kind of on behalf of all of us. And I thought that was a beautiful idea. And I mean, I held that and I honored that for many years. But it\u2019s interesting that now, as so many 21st century people are finding refuge and also a kind of grounding in these monasteries, there\u2019s a depth of reality to that idea that they are praying and being contemplative on behalf of all of us, like, keeping the doors open to these places where that can happen. And I\u2019m as fascinated by them as I am by the men who can take my car when it stops moving and magically put it together again. Right. But of course, when we think of monasteries, it gets back to what you and I were just discussing, which is \u2014 as you say \u2014 more and more people are doing what I do, which is going on retreat and wanting to recollect themselves and replenish themselves and to draw from the energy and inspiration of the monks. But fewer and fewer are ready to make a long term commitment. And I think that\u2019s a sad challenge of the age, that we\u2019re getting what we can from it, but we\u2019re not really surrendering to it absolutely in the way that would really be the most meaningful and fruitful for us. You also \u2014 you often \u2014 you write about the idea of Nowhere. Nowhere with a capital \u201CN.\u201D Would you tell me \u2014 where is that? That Nowhere with a capital \u201CN,\u201D and what does it mean? Well, it\u2019s probably the wilderness. And the wilderness is probably the place where one finds illumination. But the reason I came up with that funny formulation is that I noticed when I began traveling a lot 30 years ago, I would talk about going to Cuba or going to Tibet, and people\u2019s eyes would light up with excitement. And nowadays, I notice that people\u2019s eyes light up most in excitement when I talk about going nowhere or going offline. And I think a lot of us have the sense that we\u2019re living at the speed of light, at a pace determined by machines. And we\u2019ve lost the ability to live at the speed of life. Right. Well \u2014 that\u2019s good. Well, we are analog creatures. Yes. We \u2014 here\u2019s a place where \u2014 you said it in The Guardian, \u201CWe have more information and less space to make sense of it.\u201D I mean, that\u2019s also that \u2014 it\u2019s not just the pace, but the room to make meaning as well as just be processing or getting through our to-do lists. Exactly. And so, whoever you are, whether you\u2019re a mother raising kids or somebody going to the office, you know that really, as you said, you\u2019re extracting the meaning only when you\u2019re away from it. And I sometimes think, we\u2019re living so close to our lives, we can\u2019t make sense of them. And that\u2019s why people like me go on retreat, or other people meditate or do yoga, or other people go for runs. Each person, I think, now, has to take a conscious measure to separate yourself from experience just to be able to do justice to experience and to process, as you said, and understand what is going on in her life and direct herself. We spoke \u2014 we\u2019ve spoken about your notion of stillness, and that\u2019s one way you describe your practice. And one way you talk about that \u2014 a Buddhist corollary is this notion of \u201Cright absorption.\u201D And I really like that. And I think that also applies to what you just described \u2014 a discipline and maybe even a necessity for all of us in whatever kind of life we lead. Yes, I love that word \u201Cabsorption\u201D because I think that\u2019s my definition of happiness. And I think all of us know we are happiest when we forget ourselves, when we forget the time, when we lose ourselves in a beautiful piece of music or a movie or a deep conversation with a friend or an intimate encounter with someone we love. That\u2019s our definition of happiness. And very few people feel happy racing from one text to the next to the appointment to the cellphone to the emails. If people are happy like that, that\u2019s great. But I think a lot of us have got caught up in this cycle that we don\u2019t know how to stop and isn\u2019t sustaining us in the deepest way. And I think we all know our outer lives are only as good as our inner lives. So to neglect our inner lives is really to incapacitate our outer lives. We don\u2019t have so much to give to other people or the world or our job or our kids. You can listen again and share this conversation with Pico Iyer through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the \u201Cart of stillness\u201D with essayist, novelist, and travel writer Pico Iyer. He began his career as a journalist with Time magazine. He\u2019s now based in a modest, quiet, nearly-technology free home in Japan. He\u2019s written many books and is still often to be found in the pages of publications like The New York Times and Harpers. But he also retreats many times each year to a Benedictine hermitage in Big Sur, California. He\u2019s one of our most eloquent translators of 21st Century people\u2019s rediscovery of inner life. You know, one interesting thing you\u2019ve said about living in Japan, in fact, is that it\u2019s made you aware of time in a new way. Now, and again, I want to go back because, isn\u2019t a true \u2014 so in your 20s you left your very successful, exciting life in New York, and you \u2014 I think you left to live for a year in a temple in Kyoto, but you didn\u2019t end up staying for a year. Is that right? Exactly right. I stayed for a week, by which time I found a temple in Kyoto is very different from what I\u2019d imagined in midtown Manhattan. But I did move then to a single room on the back streets of Kyoto without even a toilet or a telephone or a bed. Oh, OK. All right then. You\u2019re absolved. But you have written that \u2014 so tell me what you learned about time, and perhaps this is still true, because you spent most of your life in Japan. I\u2019m so intrigued because I think time is just such a fascinating concept, and it has all this resonance both in science and in mysticism and \u2014 anyway. So\u2026 Yes. And I think we all know that sensation. We have more and more time saving devices but less and less time, it seems to us. Yeah. And I think when I was a boy, the sense of luxury had to do with a lot of space, maybe having a big house or a huge car. Now I think luxury has to do with having a lot of time. The ultimate luxury now might be just a blank space in the calendar. So true. So true. And interestingly enough, that\u2019s what we crave, I think, so many of us. So when I moved from New York City to rural Japan \u2014 so after my year in Kyoto, I essentially moved to a two-room apartment, which is where I still live with my wife and, formally, our two kids. And we don\u2019t have a car or a bicycle or a T.V. I can understand it\u2019s very simple, but it feels very luxurious. And one reason is that when I wake up, it seems as if the whole day stretches in front of me like an enormous meadow, which is never a sensation I had when I was in go-go New York City. And I can spend five hours at my desk. And then I can take a walk. And then I can spend one hour reading a book that where, as I read, I can feel myself, I\u2019d say, getting deeper and more attentive and more nuance. It\u2019s like a wonderful conversation. Then I have a chance to take another walk around the neighborhood, and take care of my emails and keep my bosses at bay, and then go and play ping pong, and then spend the evening with my wife. And it seems as if the day has a thousand hours, and that\u2019s exactly what I tend not to experience or feel when I\u2019m, for example, today in Los Angeles and moving from place to place. And I suppose it\u2019s a trade off. So I gave up financial security, and I gave up the excitements of the big city. But I thought it was worth it in order to have two things, freedom and time. And the biggest luxury I enjoy when I\u2019m in Japan is, as soon as I arrive there, I take off my watch, and I feel I never need to put it on again. And I can soon begin to tell the time by how the light is slanting off our walls at sunrise and when the darkness falls, and I suppose back to a more essential human life. And that\u2019s about the life you\u2019ve crafted rather than something in Japanese culture, right? It is, but of course, when I left New York City, I could have gone anywhere. And as a writer, I\u2019m lucky. I could do my job anywhere. And I think one reason I went to Japan \u2014 it goes back to what you were asking about the institutes of higher skepticism \u2014 is that my education had taught me quite well to talk, but I don\u2019t think it had taught me to listen. And my schools had taught me quite well to sort of push myself forward in the world, but it never taught me to erase myself. And the virtues of when I got to Japan, finding that I was essentially an illiterate. I can\u2019t read \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 to this day, I can\u2019t read or write Japanese. And I\u2019m at the mercy of things around me. I can\u2019t have the illusion that I\u2019m on top of things. Japan was a place that I had a huge amount to learn from, and I\u2019m still learning it. You\u2019ve talked about that we are rediscovering \u2014 I really love this phrase \u2014 the \u201Curgency of slowing down.\u201D That\u2019s wonderful. Thank you. Well, I think we\u2019re all feeling dizzy. Yeah. We got onto this accelerating roller coaster that we never quite asked to get on, and we don\u2019t know how to get off. And I think my keenest sense is that our devices are not going to go away, nor would we want them to. They\u2019ve made our lives so much brighter and healthier and longer. But it\u2019s a safe bet that they\u2019re only going to accelerate and proliferate. And we\u2019re really going to have to take emergency measures just to keep ourselves in proportion and in balance. And so I sometimes think that travel is how I get my excitement and stimulation, but stillness is how I keep myself sane. You know, Pascal, wonderfully, in the 17th century said our problem is distraction, but we try to distract ourselves from distractions. So we get even worse in this vicious cycle. So the only cure for distraction is attention. And I go to my monastery, and I go to Japan because they are cathedrals of attention. And they\u2019re places where people are very attentive and where people like me can try to learn attention. You know, and I couldn\u2019t help wondering as I\u2019m reading you and reading about the life you\u2019ve crafted, you really have chosen a simplicity that \u2014 I think you even use the word \u201Cluxurious.\u201D And you talk about being with Leonard Cohen and he uses the word \u201Cluxurious,\u201D so \u2014 you know, and in such a contrast to the you at 29, living the American dream. But also, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how much of what you\u2019ve been able to choose and create also is about the wisdom that comes just with growing older, with age, that stillness becomes more natural and more enjoyable somehow, I think, inherently. I\u2019m not sure everyone leans into that. In fact, I know they don\u2019t. But I mean, I was reading recently that there\u2019s some new study of that as people \u2014 when we\u2019re young, we\u2019re kind of hardwired to find excitement and to find satisfaction in novelty. And that as we age, we more naturally find excitement and satisfaction in what is ordinary, in patterns and habits and kind of the everyday contours of our lives. And you know, it helps me think about why wisdom comes with age, why an elder becomes an elder because what becomes more natural is really getting at, like, the deepest insights of spiritual traditions. Yes. I was just saying to somebody yesterday that, at some point \u2014 I\u2019m only I think a couple of years older than you. I noticed that I was getting so much more satisfaction from visiting my old friends than looking around for new friends. And rereading the books I\u2019ve always loved, each time, were giving me new and new things rather than trying to find the latest good book. And revisiting the places with which I have a relationship over 30 or 50 years, and instantly you don\u2019t have to explain yourself. And you\u2019re doing without the excitement of novelty, but you\u2019re into a much deeper and more intimate encounter. And you\u2019re right, that soon that becomes much more sustaining than just getting the new. And of course, the older you get, the harder it is to be confronted with something new, which is why, probably, time accelerates, and it seems like the years are whizzing by like the calendar pages in one of those old movies. Yeah. I think the other thing that I suppose I learned from Leonard Cohen was, when I met him, he was living for a monk for five years in the cold dark mountains behind Los Angeles, and he said, as you mentioned, that sitting still and looking after other people and scrubbing floors was a great voluptuous excitement of life. Yes, yes. Even though he\u2019d enjoyed all the pleasures of the world. But the second part of that process which maybe is even more important is, again, he came back into the world. And he\u2019s toured the world in his 70s for six years and became one of the most popular musicians on the planet. And I think the reason he became popular was that people could tell he was coming down from the mountain, in a way. Right. In other words, he was bringing wisdom and depth and selflessness to the concert stage just where we don\u2019t usually see it. And I think, even if they couldn\u2019t articulate it, people felt that they were getting something of the stillness and pointedness of the monastery from him, not just another kind of agenda or somebody trying to sell something. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the \u201CArt of Stillness\u201D with writer Pico Iyer. We\u2019re winding down towards the end, but I do want to ask you about mysticism. And I want to read something you wrote, it intrigued me: \u201CMysticism, to me, is what stands out of time and beyond circumstance. Read a 13th century Zen discourse, pick up St John of the cross, and listen to the latest Leonard Cohen album, and you are instantly in the same place. Mysticism is almost the unchanging backbeat and backstage truth that stands behind all the changing surfaces and shifts in the world.\u201D My heavens, I actually like that. I still believe it. Go on, go on. No, please. Well, I was just \u2014 does mysticism have a different role or a new role or an expansive role in a globalized world, in the 21st century world? I think in an accelerated world, it does because I think we need, more than ever, to root ourselves in what is out of time and larger than us and not contained in the latest CNN update. And it\u2019s wonderful to know what happened two seconds ago at the Grammys or even more important in Iraq, but we can\u2019t begin to make sense of it unless we have a larger, more spacious canvas on which to put it. And I think, in that sense, it\u2019s funny when you just read that description of mysticism, it sounds exactly like my description of my hermitage. Yeah, right. And I think I was probably using those as almost interchangeable terms there. But if mysticism is a word for that place where we are deeper and wiser than ourselves, or at least can listen to something inside ourselves, it seems much larger than we are. We certainly need that more than ever because I would imagine in the 19th century, say, when there are far fewer obvious diversions, maybe it\u2019s a romantic notion, but I imagine people being able to hear the better part of themselves a little more often. It\u2019s hard to hear in the clamor of the contemporary, and I notice people more and more talk about cutting through the noise. And that\u2019s what we really need to do. And I suppose mysticism is a way of cutting through the cacophony of the moment and reminding us of what is real, and then reminding us of how to respond to the real and to do justice to it. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 maybe that speaks to the other part of your question, which is the beauty of mysticism is it\u2019s a place where distinctions dissolve and where there\u2019s no you and me, there\u2019s no east and west, there\u2019s no old or new. We\u2019re in the place beyond dualisms and beyond the tricks of the mind, really, to go back to your point about being an intellectual. We are in that space where we\u2019re not outside the world making judgments and distinctions. We are in some truth which we don\u2019t even have to name, but it\u2019s the place where all those great traditions converge. So if Rumi and John of the Cross and Meister Eckhart and D\u014Dgen, the great Zen teacher, were to talk together, each might talk in the language and in the framework of his particular tradition, but what they\u2019d be talking about is something each of them would recognise as his most intimate reality. And none of their words would reach quite far enough. Right? No, exactly. Exactly. Mysticism is the place where all words, explanations run out. Yeah. I don\u2019t ever \u2014 I rarely see you speaking of God, and I really feel like what you just said is so eloquent, and, certainly, God is one of those realities we can only point at with words. I don\u2019t know. Do you have a sense of God, or is that language you avoid, or is it just that I haven\u2019t seen it? No, you\u2019re right. It is language I avoid. And I remember, as a little boy, whenever I saw something in capital letters, something in me would recoil. But oddly enough, somebody two weeks ago, suddenly, out of nowhere, asked me, \u201CWhat is God?\u201D And I said, \u201CReality.\u201D And I think that has many ramifications. But usually, what I would say is that \u2014 I would certainly use the word the divine as you and I have used earlier in this discussion, and I think we all have something changeless and vast and completely unfathomable inside us. And I\u2019m very happy if a Christian calls that God, and if a Muslim calls that Allah, and if a Buddhist calls that reality or something else. Again, I don\u2019t think that the names matter so much, but the truth is very, very important. And I think that\u2019s the fundamental truth that we can\u2019t afford to lose sight of. And I think, when you talked earlier on about my seeking out spiritual places and people, I suppose it\u2019s because, at very early age, I noticed, that I didn\u2019t have one fixed religion myself, that people who did have a religious commitment seemed to be acting with such kindness and such selflessness and such clarity that I thought these are people I want to learn from. And I think what I was learning from them was that they were listening to God, and even more importantly sometimes, obeying God and obeying God when God is asking them impossible things. But still, they knew that that was where their commitment lay. And so I can\u2019t begin to say how much appreciation and admiration I have for those who have made God the center of their lives, or in the case of the Dalai Lama, he might say reality is the center of his life, but it\u2019s a variation on the same thing. So you do lead this very simple life, but you write books that people read. And a couple of times in recent years, you\u2019ve had pieces in the The New York Times, and there\u2019s one you wrote a couple of years ago, maybe while you were writing your book on stillness. Was it called \u201CThe Joy of Quiet?\u201D Is that right? Yes, yes. Ms. Tippett: \u201CThe Joy of Quiet?\u201D And I just want to \u2014 you ended with \u2014 you were at your monastery, the monastery where you \u2014 your secret home, as you say, in California, I believe. And you talked about \u2014 out walking, speaking to someone who works at MTV, brings his young children there, so he\u2019s introducing them to the joy of quiet. And you had line that just stayed with me at the end: \u201CThe child of tomorrow\u201D you wrote, \u201CThe child of tomorrow, I realized, may actually be ahead of us in terms of sensing not what\u2019s new, but what\u2019s essential.\u201D I just wanted to read that back to you. It\u2019s very beautiful. Thank you. Well, thank you for such a high compliment. The reason I ended that piece with that sentence was \u2014 of course, I\u2019d begun the piece by describing how I was going to a conference in Singapore with the title \u201CMarketing to the Child of Tomorrow.\u201D Yes, yes. So that peace is really moving from the profane to the sacred, or moving from the heart of the world, where the child of tomorrow is seen in the same sentence as marketing to what is really going to support the child of tomorrow, which is far from the marketplace and is something more akin to stillness. And in fact, I wonderfully, I had an editor at The New York Times who would throw these things at me and who also commissioned the TED book a couple of years ago. So, out of the blue, though we had never met, she said, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you write a piece on silence,\u201D and then she said, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you write a piece on anxiety,\u201D and \u201CWhy don\u2019t you write a piece on suffering.\u201D And I was so glad to have the chance to talk about those things. And as you said, I was pleasantly surprised that The New York Times would want to feature those prominently in the newspaper as the corrective to the moment. I do want to ask you this large question. As you have lived this life you\u2019ve lived, how has your sense evolved of this great animating question, behind our spiritual traditions, but that also this universal human question: what does it mean to be human? I think to be human really means to be connected. And I\u2019m a rather solitary soul, and I\u2019ve talked a lot about stillness and silence. But I think that they are just way stations, they are refueling places. It\u2019s funny, when we go to an airport, nowadays, there\u2019s so many recharging stations for devices and very few for our soul. Right. All of a sudden. All of a sudden there are all these re-charging stations. All of a sudden. And we quickly realize it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s only when we recharge our soul, we can make better use of our devices. Part of my concern about the digital age is that the beauty of it is we can make contact with people on the far corners of the earth. The challenge is we sometimes lose contact with ourselves, especially our deeper selves. And then we\u2019re tempted more to define ourselves in terms of what doesn\u2019t matter and what is not going to last very long, whether it\u2019s our looks, our finances, or our resume. And I don\u2019t think anyone gets the richer if he or she defines herself in those terms. So I think to be human is to try to find the best part of yourself that is, in fact, beyond yourself, much wiser than you are, and have that to share with everyone you care for. Pico Iyer has written over a dozen books including The Global Soul: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls, and the Search for Home, and The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. More recently he authored The Art of Stillness: Adventures in Going Nowhere."
