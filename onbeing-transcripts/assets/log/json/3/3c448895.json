  "fullText": "\u201CWhy is the world so beautiful?\u201D This is a question Robin Wall Kimmerer pursues as a botanist and also as a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. She writes, \u201CScience polishes the gift of seeing, indigenous traditions work with gifts of listening and language.\u201D An expert in moss \u2014 a bryologist \u2014 she describes mosses as the \u201Ccoral reefs of the forest.\u201D She opens a sense of wonder and humility for the intelligence in all kinds of life we are used to naming and imagining as inanimate. I can\u2019t think of a single scientific study in the last few decades that has demonstrated that plants or animals are dumber than we think. It\u2019s always the opposite, right? What we\u2019re revealing is the fact that they have a capacity to learn, to have memory, and we\u2019re at the edge of a wonderful revolution in really understanding the sentience of other beings. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Robin Wall Kimmerer is a professor of environmental biology at the State University of New York and the founding director of the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment. She works with tribal nations on environmental problem-solving and sustainability. And part of that work is about recovering lineages of knowledge that were made illegal in the policies of tribal assimilation which did not fully end in the U.S. until the 1970s. Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s grandfather attended one of the now infamous boarding schools designed to \u201Ccivilize\u201D Indian youth; and she has only begun to learn the Anishinaabe language of her people as an adult. I\u2019m just so intrigued when I look at the way you introduce yourself. It will often include that you from the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, from the bear clan, adopted into the eagles. I\u2019d love for you to just take us a little bit into that world you\u2019re describing that you came from, and ask, also, the question I always ask about \u2014 what was the spiritual and religious background of that world you grew up in of your childhood? I\u2019d like to start with the second part of that question. I was lucky enough to grow up in the fields and the woods of upstate New York. I was lucky in that regard, but disappointed also in that I grew up away from the Potawatomi people, away from all of our people by virtue of history, the history of removal and the taking of children to the Indian boarding schools. And so, in a sense, the questions that I had about who I was in the world, what the world was like, those are questions that I really wished I\u2019d had a cultural elder to ask, but I didn\u2019t, but I had the woods to ask. And there\u2019s a way in which just growing up in the woods and the fields, they really became my doorway into culture. In the absence of human elders, I had plant elders instead. And it sounds like you did not grow up speaking the language of the Potawatomi nation, which is Anishnaabe, is that right? Is that how it\u2019s \u2026 That\u2019s right. Yeah, the language is called Anishinaabemowin. And the Potawatomi language is very close to that. I was intrigued to see that just a mention somewhere in your writing that you take part in a Potawatomi language lunchtime class that actually happens in Oklahoma, and you\u2019re there via the internet, because I grew up, actually, in Potawatomi County in Oklahoma. And having told you that, I never knew or learned anything about what that word meant, much less the people and the culture it described. That is so interesting to live in a place that is named that. And this is the ways in which cultures become invisible and the language becomes invisible. And through history and the reclaiming of that, the making culture visible again, to speak the language in even the tiniest amount so that it\u2019s almost as if I \u2014 it feels like the air is waiting to hear this language that had been lost for so long. So it delights me that I can be learning an ancient language by completely modern technology. Yes, that\u2019s right. Sitting at my office, eating lunch, learning Potawatomi grammar. So when you said a minute ago that you spent your childhood, and actually the searching questions of your childhood were \u2014 somehow found expression, and the closest that you came to answers, in the woods. And it seems to me that that\u2019s such a wonderful way to fill out something else you\u2019ve said before, which is that you were born a botanist, which is a way to say this, which was the language you got as you entered college at forestry school at State University of New York. Yes. And so there was no question but that I\u2019d study botany in college. It was my passion. Still is, of course. But the botany that I encountered there was so different than the way that I understood plants. Plants were reduced to object. What was supposedly important about them was the mechanism by which they worked, not what their gifts were, not what their capacities were. They were really thought of as objects, whereas I thought of them as subjects. And that shift in worldview was a big hurdle for me in entering the field of science. One way you\u2019ve said is that that science, though, was asking different questions, and you had other questions, other language, and other protocol that came from indigenous culture. There\u2019s one place in your writing where you\u2019re talking about beauty. And you\u2019re talking about a question you would have, which is why two flowers are beautiful together. And that that question, for example, would violate the division that is necessary for objectivity. But then, you do this wonderful thing where you actually give a scientific analysis of the statement that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, which would be one of the critiques of a question like that, that it\u2019s not really asking a question that is rational or scientific. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about, that \u2026 I do. I do exactly. Flesh that out, because that\u2019s such an interesting juxtaposition of how you actually started to both experience the dissonance between those kinds of questionings and also start to weave them together. Yes, it goes back to the story of when I very proudly entered the forestry school as an 18-year-old and telling them that the reason that I wanted to study botany was because I wanted to know why asters and goldenrod looked so beautiful together. These are these amazing displays of this bright, chrome yellow and deep purple of New England aster, and they look stunning together. And the two plants so often intermingle rather than living apart from one another, and I wanted to know why that was. I thought that surely in the order and the harmony of the universe, there would be an explanation for why they looked so beautiful together. And I was told that that was not science, that if I was interested in beauty, I should go to art school. Which was really demoralizing as a freshman, but I came to understand that question wasn\u2019t going to be answered by science, that science, as a way of knowing, explicitly sets aside our emotions, our aesthetic reactions to things. We have to analyze them as if they were just pure material, and not matter and spirit together. And, yes, as it turns out, there\u2019s a very good biophysical explanation for why those plants grow together, so it\u2019s a matter of aesthetics and it\u2019s a matter of ecology. Those complimentary colors of purple and gold together, being opposites on the color wheel, they\u2019re so vivid, they actually attract far more pollinators than if those two grew apart from one another. So each of those plants benefits by combining its beauty with the beauty of the other. And that\u2019s a question that science can address, certainly, as well as artists. And I just think that \u201CWhy is the world so beautiful?\u201D is a question that we all ought to be embracing. Now, you did work, for a time, at Bausch & Lomb after college. You went into a more traditional scientific endeavor. I wonder, was there a turning point, a day or a moment where you felt compelled to bring these things together in the way you could, these different ways of knowing and seeing and studying the world? Yes. I think the place that it became most important to me to start to bring these ways of knowing back together again is when, as a young Ph.D. botanist, I was invited to a gathering of traditional plant knowledge holders. And I was just there to listen, and it was such an amazing experience. Four days of listening to people whose knowledge of the plant world was so much deeper than my own. And were these elders? Were these indigenous teachers? They were. Their education was on the land and with the plants and through the oral tradition. But I just sat there and soaked in this wonderful conversation, which interwove mythic knowledge and scientific knowledge into this beautiful cultural, natural history. And, for me, it was absolutely a watershed moment, because it made me remember those things that starting to walk the science path had made me forget, or attempted to make me forget. And I just saw that their knowledge was so much more whole and rich and nurturing that I wanted to do everything that I could to bring those ways of knowing back into harmony. You said at one point that you had gotten to the point where \u2014 you were talking about the names of plants. \u201CI was teaching the names and ignoring the songs.\u201D What do you mean by that? One of the difficulties of moving in the scientific world is that when we name something, often with a scientific name, this name becomes almost an end to inquiry. We sort of say, well, we know it now. We\u2019re able to systematize it and put a Latin binomial on it, so it\u2019s ours. We know what we need to know. But that is only in looking, of course, at the morphology of the organism, at the way that it looks. It ignores all of its relationships. It\u2019s such a mechanical, wooden representation of what a plant really is. And we reduce them tremendously if we just think about them as physical elements of the ecosystem. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer. She writes books that join new scientific and ancient indigenous knowledge, including Gathering Moss and Braiding Sweetgrass. So this notion of the earth\u2019s animacy, of the animacy of the natural world and everything in it, including plants, is very pivotal to your thinking, and to the way you explore the natural world, even scientifically, and draw conclusions, also, about our relationship to the natural world. So I really want to delve into that some more. You said that there\u2019s a grammar of animacy. Talk about that a little bit. Yes. This comes back to what I think of as the innocent or childlike way of knowing. Actually, that\u2019s a terrible thing to call it. We say it\u2019s an innocent way of knowing, and, in fact, it\u2019s a very worldly and wise way of knowing. And that kind of deep attention that we pay as children is something that I cherish, that I think we all can cherish and reclaim that, because attention is that doorway to gratitude, the doorway to wonder, the doorway to reciprocity. And it worries me greatly that today\u2019s children can recognize 100 corporate logos and fewer than ten plants. That means they\u2019re not paying attention. In the English language, if we want to speak of that sugar maple or that salamander, the only grammar that we have to do so it to call those beings an \u201Cit.\u201D And if I called my grandmother or the person sitting across the room from me an \u201Cit,\u201D that would be so rude, right? And we wouldn\u2019t tolerate that for members of our own species, but we not only tolerate it, but it\u2019s the only way we have in the English language to speak of other beings, is as \u201Cit.\u201D In Potawatomi, the cases that we have are animate and inanimate, and it is impossible in our language to speak of other living beings as \u201Cit\u201Ds. So living beings would all be animate, all living beings, anything that was alive in the Potawatomi language. Yes. Absolutely. And inanimate would be, what, materials or \u2026 You raise a very good question, because the way that, again, Western science would give the criteria for what does it mean to be alive is a little different than you might find in traditional culture, where we think of water as alive, as rocks as alive \u2014 alive in different ways, but certainly not inanimate. Generally, the inanimate grammar is reserved for those things which humans have created. OK. Like the table, something like that? Would that \u2026 Yes, exactly. Right, yes. And I have to say \u2014 and I\u2019m sure you know this, because I\u2019m sure you get this reaction a lot, especially in scientific circles \u2014 it\u2019s unfamiliar and slightly uncomfortable in Western ears to hear someone refer to plants as persons. It\u2019s unfamiliar. Does that happen a lot? Is that kind of a common reaction? Sure, sure. Scientists are very eager to say that we oughtn\u2019t to personify elements in nature for fear of anthropomorphizing. And what I mean when I talk about the personhood of all beings, plants included, is not that I am attributing human characteristics to them, not at all. I\u2019m attributing plant characteristics to plants. Just as it would be disrespectful to try and put plants in the same category through the lens of anthropomorphism, I think it\u2019s also deeply disrespectful to say that they have no consciousness, no awareness, no being-ness at all. And this denial of personhood to all other beings is increasingly being refuted by science itself. There are \u2026 That\u2019s interesting. Yeah. I can\u2019t think of a single scientific study in the last few decades that has demonstrated that plants or animals are dumber than we think. It\u2019s always the opposite, right? What we\u2019re revealing is the fact that they have extraordinary capacities, which are so unlike our own, but we dismiss them because, well, if they don\u2019t do it like animals do it, then they must not be doing anything, when, in fact, they\u2019re sensing their environment, responding to their environment in incredibly sophisticated ways. The science which is showing that plants have capacity to learn, to have memory, it\u2019s really \u2014 we\u2019re at the edge of a wonderful revolution in really understanding the sentience of other beings. Yeah. Here\u2019s something beautiful that you wrote in your book Gathering Moss, just as an example. \u201CThe rocks are beyond slow, beyond strong, and yet, yielding to a soft, green breath as powerful as a glacier, the mosses wearing away their surfaces grain by grain, bringing them slowly back to sand. There is an ancient conversation going on between mosses and rocks, poetry to be sure. About light and shadow and the drift of continents.\u201D That\u2019s so beautiful and so amazing to think about, to just read those sentences and think about that conversation, as you say. Yes. And it\u2019s a conversation that takes place at a pace that we humans, especially we contemporary humans who are rushing about, we can\u2019t even grasp the pace at which that conversation takes place. And so thinking about plants as persons, indeed, thinking about rocks as persons, forces us to shed our idea of the only pace that we live in is the human pace. And it\u2019s, I think, very, very exciting to think about these ways of being which happen on completely different scales, and so exciting to think about what we might learn from them. You make such an interesting observation that the way you walk through the world and immerse yourself in moss and plant life \u2014 you\u2019ve said you become aware that we have some deficits compared to our companion species. I sense that photosynthesis, that we can\u2019t even photosynthesize, that this is a quality you covet \u2026 It\u2019s true. \u2026in our botanical brothers and sisters. Take me inside that, because I want to understand that. I do. I have photosynthesis envy. The ability to take these non-living elements of the world, air and light and water, and turn them into food that can then be shared with the whole rest of the world \u2014 to turn them into medicine that is medicine for people and for trees and for soil, and we cannot even approach the kind of creativity that they have. One thing you say that I\u2019d like to understand better is, \u201CScience polishes the gift of seeing, indigenous traditions work with gifts of listening and language.\u201D So I\u2019d love an example of something \u2014 what are the gifts of seeing that science offers, and then the gifts of listening and language, and how all of that gives you this rounded understanding of something? What I mean when I say that \u201Cscience polishes the gift of seeing\u201D brings us to an intense kind of attention that science allows us to bring to the natural world, and that kind of attention also includes ways of seeing, quite literally, through other lenses \u2014 that we might have the hand lens, the magnifying glass in our hands that allows us to look at that moss with an acuity that the human eye doesn\u2019t have so we see more. The microscope that lets us see the gorgeous architecture by which it\u2019s put together, the scientific instrumentation in the laboratory that would allow us to look at the miraculous way that water interacts with cellulose, let\u2019s say. That\u2019s what I mean by \u201Cscience polishes our ability to see\u201D \u2014 it extends our eyes into other realms. But we\u2019re, in many cases, looking at the surface. And by the surface, I mean the material being alone. But in indigenous ways of knowing, we say that we know a thing when we know it not only with our physical senses, with our intellect, but also when we engage our intuitive ways of knowing, of emotional knowledge and spiritual knowledge. And that\u2019s really what I mean by listening. By seeing that traditional knowledge engages us in listening. And what is the story that that being might share with us if we know how to listen as well as we know how to see? You can listen again and share this conversation with Robin Wall Kimmerer through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer. She\u2019s a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, and she joins scientific and indigenous ways of seeing in her research and in her writing for a broad audience. We\u2019re exploring her sense of the intelligence in life we are used to seeing as inanimate. She says that as our knowledge of plant life unfolds, human vocabulary and imaginations must adapt. Let\u2019s talk some more about mosses, because you did write this beautiful book about it, and you are a bryologist. And that\u2019s a specialty, even within plant biology. Within botany. I\u2019ve seen you describe \u2014 within botany. And also I learned that your work with moss inspired Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s novel The Signature Of All Things, which is about a botanist. I learned so many things from that book. It\u2019s also that I had never thought very deeply about moss, but that moss inhabits nearly every ecosystem on earth, over 22,000 species, that mosses have the ability to clone themselves from broken off leaves or torn fragments, that they\u2019re integral to the functioning of a forest. I mean, just describe some of things you\u2019ve heard and understood from moss. Thank you for asking that question, because it really gets to this idea how science asks us to learn about organisms. Traditional knowledge asks us to learn from them. And when I think about mosses, in particular, as the most ancient of land plants, they have been here for a very long time. They\u2019ve figured out a lot about how to live well on the earth, and, for me, I think they\u2019re really good storytellers in the way that they live. An example of what I mean by this is in their simplicity, in the power of being small, mosses become so successful all over the world because they live in these tiny little layers on rocks, on logs, and on trees. They work with the natural forces that lie over every little surface of the world, and to me, they\u2019re exemplars of not only surviving, but flourishing by working with natural processes. Mosses are superb teachers about living within your means. And you say they take possession of spaces that are too small \u2014 other plants are excluded from those spaces, but they thrive there. That\u2019s right. Mosses have, in the ecological sense, very low competitive ability, because they\u2019re small, because they don\u2019t grab resources very efficiently, and so this means that they have to live in the interstices. They have to live in places where the dominant competitive plants can\u2019t live. But the way that they do this really brings into question the whole premise that competition is what really structures biological evolution and biological success. Because mosses are not good competitors at all, and yet they are the oldest plants on the planet. They have persisted here for 350 million years. They ought to be doing something right here. And one of those somethings, I think, has to do with their ability to cooperate with one another, to share the limited resources that they have, to really give more than they take. Mosses build soil, they purify water, they are like the coral reefs of the forest, they make homes for this myriad of all these very cool little invertebrates who live in there. They are just engines of biodiversity. They do all of these things, and yet, they\u2019re only a centimeter tall. Right. Another point that is implied in how you talk about us acknowledging the animacy of plants is that whenever we use the language of \u201Cit,\u201D whatever we\u2019re talking about \u2014 well, let\u2019s say this. We don\u2019t call anything we love and want to protect and would work to protect \u201Cit.\u201D That language distances us. It certainly does. And the language of \u201Cit,\u201D which distances, disrespects, and objectifies, I can\u2019t help but think is at the root of a worldview that allows us to exploit nature. And by exploit, I mean in a way that really seriously degrades the land and the waters, because, in fact, we have to consume. We have to take. We are animals, right? But that, to me, is different than really rampant exploitation. But this is why I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about \u2014 are there ways to bring this notion of animacy into the English language? Because so many of us that I\u2019ve talked to about this feel really deeply uncomfortable calling the living world \u201Cit,\u201D and yet, we don\u2019t have an alternative, other than \u201Che\u201D or \u201Cshe.\u201D And I\u2019ve been thinking about the inspiration that the Anishinaabe language offers in this way, and contemplating new pronouns. You\u2019ve been playing with one or two, haven\u2019t you? I have. I\u2019ve been thinking about the word \u201Caki\u201D in our language, which refers to land. And there\u2019s a beautiful word \u2014 \u201Cbimaadiziaki,\u201D which one of my elders kindly shared with me. It means \u201Ca living being of the earth.\u201D But could we be inspired by that little sound at the end of that word, the \u201C-ki\u201D? And use \u201Cki\u201D as a pronoun, a respectful pronoun inspired by this language as an alternative to \u201Che,\u201D \u201Cshe,\u201D or \u201Cit,\u201D so that when I\u2019m tapping my maples in the springtime, I can say, \u201CWe\u2019re going to go hang the bucket on ki. Ki is giving us maple syrup this springtime.\u201D And so this, then, of course, acknowledges the being-ness of that tree, and we don\u2019t reduce it to an object. It feels so wrong to say that. And I have some reservations about using a word inspired from the Anishinaabe language, because I don\u2019t, in any way, want to engage in cultural appropriation. But this word, this sound, \u201Cki\u201D, is, of course, also the word for \u201Cwho\u201D in Spanish and in French. It turns out that, of course, it\u2019s an alternate pronunciation for \u201Cchi,\u201D for life force, for life energy. I\u2019m finding lots of examples that people are bringing to me where this word also means a living being of the earth. That\u2019s really interesting. The plural pronoun that I think is perhaps even more powerful is not one that we need to be inspired by another language, because we already have it in English, and that is the word \u201Ckin.\u201D That\u2019s the plural of \u201Cki\u201D? Yes, \u201Ckin\u201D is the plural of \u201Cki.\u201D So that when the geese fly overhead, we can say, \u201CKin are flying south for the winter. Come back soon.\u201D So that every time we speak of the living world, we can embody our relatedness to them. Sustainability is the language we use about \u2014 is some language we use about the world we\u2019re living into, or need to live into. And I sense from your writing and especially from your indigenous tradition that sustainability really is not big enough, and that it might even be a cop-out. You didn\u2019t use that language, but you\u2019re actually talking about a much more generous and expansive vision of relatedness between humans and the natural worlds and what we want to create. I am. I agree with you that the language of sustainability is pretty limited. If something is going to be sustainable, its ability to provide for us will not be compromised into the future. And that\u2019s all a good thing. But at its heart, sustainability, the way we think about it, is embedded in this worldview that we, as human beings, have some ownership over these, what we call, resources, and that we want the world to be able to continue to keep \u2014 that human beings can keep taking and keep consuming. The notion of reciprocity is really different from that. It\u2019s an expansion from that, because what it says is that our role as human people is not just to take from the earth, and the role of the earth is not just to provide for our single species. So reciprocity actually kind of broadens this notion to say that not only does the earth sustain us, but that we have the capacity and the responsibility to sustain her in return. So it broadens the notion of what it is to be a human person, not just a consumer. And there\u2019s such joy in being able to do that, to have it be a mutual flourishing instead of the more narrow definition of sustainability so that we can just keep on taking. I keep thinking, as I\u2019m reading you and now as I\u2019m listening to you \u2014 a conversation I\u2019ve had across the years with Christians who are going back to the Bible and seeing how certain translations and readings and interpretations, especially of that language of Genesis about human beings being blessed to have dominion \u2014 what is it \u2014 \u201Cto have dominion and subdue the earth,\u201D was read in a certain way and a certain period of time by human beings, by industrialists and colonizers and even missionaries, so there is language, and there\u2019s a mentality about taking that actually seemed to have kind of a religious blessing on it. And now people are reading those same texts differently. Do you ever have those conversations with people? Because the tradition you come from would never, ever have read the text that way. So we\u2019re \u2014 culturally, we are incrementally moving more towards the worldview that you come from. I think that that\u2019s true, and I think that that longing and the materiality of the need for redefining our relationship with place is being taught to us by the land, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve seen that, in a way, we\u2019ve been captured by a worldview of dominion that does not serve our species well in the long term, and, moreover, it doesn\u2019t serve all the other beings in creation well at all. And so we are attempting a mid-course correction here. And I think that\u2019s really important to recognize, that for most of human history, I think the evidence suggests that we have lived well and in balance with the living world. And it\u2019s, to my way of thinking, almost an eyeblink of time in human history that we have had a truly adversarial relationship with nature. And so it seems to me that this view that you have of the natural world and our place in it, it\u2019s a way to think about biodiversity and us as part of that, but reciprocity, again, takes that a step farther, right? Yes. The idea of reciprocity, of recognizing that we humans do have gifts that we can give in return for all that has been given to us is, I think, a really generative and creative way to be a human in the world. And some of our oldest teachings are saying that \u2014 what does it mean to be an educated person? It means that you know what your gift is and how to give it on behalf of the land and of the people, just like every single species has its own gift. And if one of those species and the gifts that it carries is missing in biodiversity, the ecosystem is depauperate, the ecosystem is too simple. It doesn\u2019t work as well when that gift is missing. Here\u2019s something you wrote. You wrote \u2014 you talked about goldenrods and asters a minute ago, and you said, \u201CWhen I am in their presence, their beauty asks me for reciprocity, to be the complimentary color, to make something beautiful in response.\u201D Yes. And I think of my writing very tangibly as my way of entering into reciprocity with the living world. It\u2019s that which I can give and it comes from my years as a scientist, of deep paying attention to the living world, and not only to their names, but to their songs. And having heard those songs, I feel a deep responsibility to share them, and to see if, in some way, stories could help people fall in love with the world again. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with botanist and nature writer Robin Wall Kimmerer. You remain a professor of environmental biology\u2026 That\u2019s right. \u2026at SUNY, and you have also created this Center for Native Peoples and the Environment. So you\u2019re also \u2014 that\u2019s also a gift you\u2019re bringing. You\u2019re bringing these disciplines into conversation with each other. I wonder, what is happening in that conversation? How is that working, and are there things happening that surprise you? Yes. What we\u2019re trying to do at the Center For Native Peoples and the Environment is to bring together the tools of Western science, but to employ them, or maybe deploy them, in the context of some of the indigenous philosophy and ethical frameworks about our relationship to the earth. One of the things that I would especially like to highlight about that is I really think of our work as, in a sense, trying to indigenize science education within the academy. Because as a young person, as a student entering into that world, and understanding that the indigenous ways of knowing, these organic ways of knowing, are really absent from academia, I think that we can train better scientists, train better environmental professionals when there\u2019s a plurality of these ways of knowing, when indigenous knowledge is present in the discussion. So we have created a new minor in indigenous peoples and the environment, so that when our students leave and when our students graduate, they have an awareness of other ways of knowing, they have this glimpse into a worldview which is really different from the scientific worldview. So I think of them as just being stronger and have this ability for what has been called \u201Ctwo-eyed seeing,\u201D seeing the world through both of these lenses, and in that way, have a bigger toolset for environmental problem-solving. So much of what we do as environmental scientists \u2014 if we take a strictly scientific approach, we have to exclude values and ethics, right? Because those are not part of the scientific method. There\u2019s good reason for that, and much of the power of the scientific method comes from the rationality and the objectivity. But a lot of the problems that we face in terms of sustainability and environment lie at the juncture of nature and culture. So we can\u2019t just rely on a single way of knowing that explicitly excludes values and ethics. That\u2019s not going to move us forward. I know this is a fairly new program, but I wonder, are you seeing students take up this task of creating synergy? And I think you\u2019ve used the word \u201Csymbiosis,\u201D or this two-eyed seeing. Are you seeing results that are interesting about how people are applying this, or where they are taking it? Or is it just too early for that? Well, it\u2019s too early to see it, I think, in what those scientific and professional metrics, if you will. But what I see is that the students who have become acquainted with these ways of knowing are the natural disseminators of these ideas. They tell me that when they\u2019re taking their other classes in conservation biology or wildlife ecology or fisheries, they now feel like they have the vocabulary and the perspective to speak up and say, well, when we\u2019re designing this salmon management plan, what is the input of native peoples? How will their traditional knowledge help us do better fisheries management? The invisible knowledge of traditional knowledge has become visible and has become part of the discourse. In your book Braiding Sweetgrass, there\u2019s this line: \u201CIt came to me while picking beans, the secret of happiness.\u201D And you talk about gardening, which is actually something that many people do, and I think more people are doing. So that\u2019s a very concrete way of illustrating this. It is. In talking with my environment students, they wholeheartedly agree that they love the earth. But when I ask them the question of does the earth love you back, there\u2019s a great deal of hesitation and reluctance and eyes cast down, like, oh, gosh, I don\u2019t know. Are we even allowed to talk about that? That would mean that the earth had agency and that I was not an anonymous little blip on the landscape, that I was known by my home place. So it\u2019s a very challenging notion, but I bring it to the garden and think about the way that when we, as human people, demonstrate our love for one another, it is in ways that I find very much analogous to the way that the earth takes care of us, is when we love somebody, we put their wellbeing at the top of a list and we want to feed them well. We want to nurture them. We want to teach them. We want to bring beauty into their lives. We want to make them comfortable and safe and healthy. That\u2019s how I demonstrate love, in part, to my family, and that\u2019s just what I feel in the garden, as the earth loves us back in beans and corn and strawberries. Food could taste bad. It could be bland and boring, but it isn\u2019t. There are these wonderful gifts that the plant beings, to my mind, have shared with us. And it\u2019s a really liberating idea to think that the earth could love us back, but it\u2019s also the notion that \u2014 it opens the notion of reciprocity that with that love and regard from the earth comes a real deep responsibility. Yeah. What is it you say? \u201CThe large framework of that is the renewal of the world for the privilege of breath.\u201D I think that\u2019s right on the edge. Yes. I\u2019m thinking of how, for all the public debates we have about our relationship with the natural world, and whether it\u2019s climate change or not, or man-made, there\u2019s also the reality that very few people living anywhere don\u2019t have some experience of the natural world changing in ways that they often don\u2019t recognize. And in all kinds of places with all kinds of political cultures, where I see people just getting together and doing the work that needs to be done, and becoming stewards, however they justify that or however they \u2014 wherever they fit into the public debates or not, a kind of common denominator is that they have discovered a love for the place they come from. And that that they share. And they may have these same kinds of political differences that are out there, but there\u2019s this love of place, and that creates a different world of action. Are there communities that you think of when you think of this kind of communal love of place where you see new models happening? There are many, many examples. I think so many of them are rooted in the food movement. I think that\u2019s really exciting because there is a place where reciprocity between people and the land is expressed in food, and who doesn\u2019t want that? It\u2019s good for people. It\u2019s good for land. So I think movements from tree planting to community gardens, farm-to-school, local, organic \u2014 all of these things are just at the right scale, because the benefits come directly into you and to your family, and the benefits of your relationships to land are manifest right in your community, right in your patch of soil and what you\u2019re putting on your plate. Just as the land shares food with us, we share food with each other and then contribute to the flourishing of that place that feeds us. Yeah. I want to read something from \u2014 I\u2019m sure this is from Braiding Sweetgrass. You wrote, \u201CWe are all bound by a covenant of reciprocity. Plant breath for animal breath, winter and summer, predator and prey, grass and fire, night and day, living and dying. Our elders say that ceremony is the way we can remember to remember. In the dance of the giveaway, remember that the earth is a gift we must pass on just as it came to us. When we forget, the dances we\u2019ll need will be for mourning, for the passing of polar bears, the silence of cranes, for the death of rivers, and the memory of snow.\u201D That\u2019s one of the hard places you\u2019re \u2014 this world you straddle brings you to. But, again, all these things you live with and learn, how do they start to shift the way you think about what it means to be human? The passage that you just read, and all of the experience, I suppose, that flows into that has, as I\u2019ve gotten older, brought me to a really acute sense, not only of the beauty of the world, but the grief that we feel for it, for her, for ki. That we can\u2019t have an awareness of the beauty of the world without also a tremendous awareness of the wounds. That we see the old growth forest and we also see the clear cut. We see the beautiful mountain and we see it torn open for mountaintop removal. And so one of the things that I continue to learn about and need to learn more about is the transformation of love to grief to even stronger love and the interplay of love and grief that we feel for the world. And how to harness the power of those related impulses is something that I have had to learn.
