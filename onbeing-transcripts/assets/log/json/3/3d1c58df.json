  "fullText": "Well, we\u2019re sort of seduced into thinking that here\u2019s life, and then there\u2019s these bad things that can happen that are like obstacles that just fall into your road, as if the obstacle is not the road, you know? Right. We want to think that, all things being equal, we should be content all the time, and would be, except for these pesky flies that want to ruin every picnic, as if that isn\u2019t what the picnic is. Joe Henry is cherished by his fans and fellow musicians for the inward wisdom he brings to the art and craft of making music. He\u2019s produced over a dozen albums of his own and for an array of other artists, including Ani DiFranco, Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt, Allen Toussaint, and Billy Bragg. He\u2019s written songs together with Rosanne Cash and Madonna. With Joe Henry, we probe the mystery and adventure of life and songwriting. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Joe Henry was born in the South but grew up mostly in Michigan. He\u2019s now based in Los Angeles with his wife, Melanie. Their long marriage is a vivid presence, across time, in his songs. He joined me in the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis in 2015, while on tour for his album Invisible Hour. You know, you\u2019ve said that what the Bible means to your parents, The American Songbook means to you. Was that always true? I mean, that gives me the impression that the Bible was a presence in your childhood. Oh, it was. Absolutely. I mean, my parents \u2014 both from North Carolina, as I am. I didn\u2019t really grow up there, but my parents both came from the Charlotte area. And they\u2019re very devout Christian people. And, I mean, so I did grow up with that being an absolute, fundamental part of their being. And I was not only invited for that to be true for me, but \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say insisted \u2014 but I was brought up as if that was \u2014 this is your vocabulary. This is your spiritual, cultural vocabulary. But I will say that, with no disrespect at all to my beloved parents and their faith, which is paramount to them and remains so, even as a young person, that wasn\u2019t authentic to me. Music, on the other hand, without me having to decide to let it in, changed me. And you\u2019re so vulnerable to influence, especially when you don\u2019t know you\u2019re being influenced. When you\u2019re young enough and something enters your psychic bloodstream and changes that landscape, and you don\u2019t know to protect those borders, you\u2019re wide open to it. I found it doing to me what I now think other people \u2014 what they get out of a spiritual awakening, I got from a musical awakening. I didn\u2019t know how to call it that. But I see now that that\u2019s what was happening to me. Yeah. And is it right that you were a stutterer? That you stuttered when you were a child? Yes. Yeah. But you could sing. Well, yes. The truth is that I never really stopped. I\u2019ve just gotten really good at driving around it. Mm. I mean, I don\u2019t think about it. But there are moments where I notice that there\u2019s a word that I understand that I can\u2019t say, and I pick another one. You\u2019ve always been really expressive in writing about your music, which every musician is not. I mean, even like the liner notes, right? It\u2019s not something I would normally have as part of the research, but I realized that those liner notes were really important. When you\u2019re writing about the new album, you write about \u2014 you say that this stands as a defining moment personally as an artist, though you preface that by saying, \u201CI feel myself continuing to evolve daily.\u201D And that\u2019s really apparent, that kind of personal evolution through time. And it seems like you\u2019ve been aware and able to be articulate about this evolution, both of who you are and how songs arise, and the interplay between those two things. Well, I will say that there was a long time where I didn\u2019t think I was allowed to be observant of my process, or certainly not allowed to talk about it. Because the musicians I most admired were, and are, famously big liars, for starters. But even beyond that, unwilling to cast too much of a light on the work that the work itself is not throwing off. You\u2019re not there to explain a song to anybody. Right. You\u2019re not there to hold anybody\u2019s hand through it, nor should you. But I will say that, as I continue in my work life more and more, all the lines that I used to think distinguished one part of my job from another part of my job are all very blurred now. I don\u2019t really observe a difference in what I do for myself as an artist or what I do for other people when I work as a record producer. I don\u2019t think very differently about how I write liner notes, for instance, than how I write songs. It\u2019s about \u2014 it\u2019s surrender more than anything. Yeah. And it\u2019s about listening to what this means to say, and not what I mean to say. Right. Because I love a lot of songs where I don\u2019t have one idea what\u2019s going on in them. Well, right. But see \u2014 and I think that\u2019s what intrigues me, is the kind of the adventure and the mystery of writing that you\u2019re very aware of as you write your songs. Well, \u201Cmystery\u201D is the word. Yeah. That you give voice to something that you didn\u2019t know you thought. And that you may have to spend some time figuring out what it means. It\u2019s very mysterious and wonderful. Well, it is mysterious. I mean, I think as anybody who lives any kind of creative \u2014 is devoted to a creative life, but not only \u2014 I mean, any of us alive. I mean, we\u2019re really called to \u2014 not to dispel mystery but to abide it, to engage it. And that doesn\u2019t mean necessarily making sense out of it. It\u2019s just understanding that there\u2019s a big part of this that is inherently and beautifully and romantically mysterious \u2014 has to be and always shall be. I write to discover. Yeah. And if I\u2019m engaged by what that writing has become, then I try to think about what \u2014 might it engage anybody else. It\u2019s to just try to put my finger on it and hear it. Some of the ways you\u2019ve written about that process, they remind me about the way novelists write about the process of writing. You\u2019ve written, \u201CThere are many ways a song can take shape, and they can always be different. They need only to be finally a living thing unto themselves.\u201D That \u201Cthe opening line of a song might come to you like a book falling open.\u201D Yeah. Well. And that\u2019s that adventure, that\u2026 Well, again, it\u2019s the idea that even as you\u2019re writing, you\u2019re not trying to rearticulate a finished thought that stands fully formed in your mind. I mean, I assume that maybe you know the poet Jane Hirshfield. You know her work at all? Mm-hmm. I\u2019m a great admirer of hers. And we\u2019ve never met face to face, but we\u2019ve become great pen pals. But she was writing to me recently about that very real notion that \u201Cthe poem has an intelligence that the poet does not have.\u201D So how do you think about the alchemy that does happen between \u2014 we talk about you as a writer, but you write songs. And how do words shift and change when music wraps around them or they make their way inside music? How do you think about that? Well, I think about that as little as possible in some ways. Because there\u2019s an impulse that\u2019s purely fear-based that if you try to understand too much about how that works, it will stop working. Yeah. And I don\u2019t really think that any of this is that fragile. I\u2019m not actually fearful of it. But it\u2019s something that is absolutely mysterious \u2014 why some thought seems to be musical thought. Like I said, some things show up as a poem. And I just understand that this is not something that would be musical coming out of my mouth. Even if it\u2019s thematically something I might write a song about or might show up in a song. There are certain words \u2014 or I think \u2014 I\u2019ll be writing and say, \u201CIf this is a poem, that\u2019s the right word. If it\u2019s a song, it\u2019s the wrong word.\u201D Because that\u2019s not a musical \u2014 there\u2019s not a musical tonality to that word. Right. You might write something that\u2019s deliberately a little awkward to slow listeners and readers down so that they don\u2019t just blaze through it like they\u2019re reading a grocery list. Hmm. That\u2019s really interesting. I think that\u2019s the kind of analysis that most listeners to music wouldn\u2019t make. I\u2019m not aware of that. Until you say it, and it\u2019s true. Well, one of your confederates was talking to me earlier this morning about George Jones. And I was just remembering \u2014 I\u2019m remembering now that at one point, he was pitched to sing a song that Paul Westerberg had written \u2014 one of your favorite sons here in the Twin Cities, Paul Westerberg of the Replacements. His song \u201CHere Comes A Regular\u201D was pitched to George Jones. And the word \u201Cfridge\u201D is in the song. And George says, \u201CI can\u2019t sing that song. I could never sing the word \u2018fridge\u2019.\u201D That\u2019s the way I heard the story anyway. Yeah. And I thought, \u201CWell, of course not.\u201D To George that\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019s not a musical word. Yeah. And that\u2019s\u2026 And not a beautiful word. No, no. Yeah. That makes sense. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with singer-songwriter Joe Henry. I really, really love Invisible Hour. Well, thank you. Your \u2014 as we\u2019re speaking here, it\u2019s your newest album. I\u2019m so intrigued by how we use \u2014 I think people still talk about records and albums. Those of us who make them, I promise you. We haven\u2019t cast those things aside, right? We can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not the same as\u2026 Oh, we still say \u201Calbum,\u201D you know? Yeah. Because it\u2019s a deliberate statement. Yeah. We understand album as a durable format just like a haiku is a durable format. The blues form as a songwriting form is durable. And the hour-and-a-half movie, the three-act play \u2014 an album\u2019s still 10-12 songs. We know how to hear that and still follow the arc. Right. So Invisible Hour is the latest one. And you kind of said after the fact \u2014 writing about after the fact that you realized it was about marriage, but really, the redemptive power of love in the face of fear. To me, if it\u2019s about marriage, it\u2019s just marriage as a most intense way to talk about the complexity of human beings together. Mm-hmm. Well, I realized \u2014 I thought, after the fact, that time was the thread that connected all the songs \u2014 that in some way all the characters were grappling with time. And after I finished Invisible Hour, I thought, well, all the characters in some way are challenging themselves with commitment to somebody. Mm-hmm. Or they are bereft of a commitment and desperately in need of one. But looking at it from either side, you\u2019re still talking about the way in which real commitment informs and changes all of us. Yeah. And also I think how real commitment is so exacting and never complete, right? Or how it\u2019s always this \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s just these two lines from \u201CGrave Angels\u201D \u2014 \u201CWe are gathered together. We are hidden from view.\u201D And those two things are always true even in the most intimate relationship. Sure. And, I mean, I think one thing that you\u2019re getting at is this idea that marriage is a verb, not a noun. It\u2019s not something you did. It\u2019s not something you possess. It\u2019s something that you engage in and you have to be \u2014 you are being married all the time. You didn\u2019t get married. You are in the process of being married. I am, as I sit before you, even though I\u2019m a long way from home, I\u2019m asked to be constantly engaged in being married. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s \u2014 it sounds like a subtle distinction, and it\u2019s not subtle at all. And I guess \u2014 and that\u2019s where all this comes from in you. And then I guess, part of this mystery and power that we\u2019ve talked about of writing or songs is \u2014 those of us who don\u2019t have a marriage still have all these other relationships where we grapple with this reality of being gathered together and hidden from view at the same time. Sure. And I\u2019m not just talking about formalized, legal marriage, of course. Yeah, I know. It\u2019s \u2014 I think if it works at all, it\u2019s that idea of \u2014 I sort of accept my own marriage as absolute fact of my person. And I think of that like I look at my relationship to my children or to my brother David, for example. I could have a big falling out with my brother David, but it wouldn\u2019t change the fundamental fact that he\u2019s my brother. Even if we were estranged, God forbid, that would be true. And I think that, at least for me, that\u2019s how I see my marriage. It\u2019s just that no matter what happens, that has become a fundamental absolute of the fabric of my being. And I don\u2019t know how to see myself without that component. I don\u2019t know myself without that piece of that puzzle in place. Just like I don\u2019t know myself not being a parent. Yeah. I almost don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like. I\u2019ve said to my wife, Melanie, I can think back to our married days before children, and it\u2019s almost like I knew who our children were. They just hadn\u2019t arrived. But in retrospect, I feel like I don\u2019t know myself without knowing them. I know. I said that to one of my best friends the other day because we\u2019re at this place where our children are growing up and leaving. But I said I cannot imagine who I would be without them. Like, I can\u2019t even imagine that person. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s impossible. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to read these lines because they\u2019re so beautiful. This is also from the \u201CGrave Angels\u201D song: \u201CI take this to be holy \u2014 If futile, uncertain and dire: Our union of fracture, our dread everlasting, This beautiful, desperate desire. The cloud darkens to harrow, It crosses your heart like hand, but it\u2019s cool like the shadow of all that we\u2019ve seen by the Light that we can\u2019t understand.\u201D What\u2019s it like for you to hear words like that read back to you? Well, I happen to like those, so thanks. I hear a different musicality in them coming from you than if I were to try to read them, which is really interesting. Yeah. Do you know what those words mean now? I think I do. At a certain point, I think my interpretation after the fact doesn\u2019t have any more authority than yours or anybody\u2019s. Right. I like the acknowledgement at the end of that stanza that you read about sort of the idea that we live amongst shadow. But the light that creates the shadow is absolutely, in so many ways, unknowable to us. And yet it\u2019s a source of all that moves around us and makes things move around us. And yet, there is just this part of it that is paramount and completely unknowable. Mm-hmm. And that thing you said about your interpretation not being any more valid than anyone else\u2019s once the song is out there in the world \u2014 that\u2019s so interesting. I mean, that\u2019s part of that mystery of writing, isn\u2019t it too? Well, it\u2019s back to letting go of this idea that you\u2019re not going to \u2014 of the impulse of trying to explain anything to anybody. But I also think you\u2019re talking about the fact that there\u2019s reality and dignity in however it lands, whatever meaning it lands with, in any ears, in any life. Well, in the same way that when Thomas Merton said, \u201CEverything that is, is holy,\u201D takes away any impulse to want to judge anything \u2014 to be anything other than sacred. The only thing that\u2019s \u201Cother\u201D is how we choose to dishonor those things. But nothing by its nature is not sacred. I mean, even the most deadly thing only is anything other than sacred if we elect to be less with it. I want to talk to you about God. Sure. Which many people would hear what you just said about that light that\u2019s ever present. Mm-hmm. That that might be a way of talking about God. I sense that, in the course of your life in your writing, you\u2019ve had a different relationship with using that word. I sure have. But then it\u2019s kind of surprised you that it\u2019s become more overt and more present and more frequent? Well, part of it is you just live long enough, and you really do learn to care less about what anybody might think about what you might offer. That\u2019s one of the great bonuses of surviving. Yeah. Yeah. For a while, I think I really would\u2019ve resisted anything that felt like I was directly referencing so-called \u201CGod\u201D and how anybody might perceive God. You just wrote in those liner notes to the Civilians album in 2007, \u201CSpeaking of which, I have noticed with surprise, and only in retrospect, how often God is mentioned throughout this 12-song cycle, and He must be surprised as well.\u201D You went on to say you recognize \u201Cin his many appearances one among us who stretches like\u201D \u2014 oh, OK, so I have to read the whole thing. \u201CI recognize in his many appearances, though, not the God of my Methodist raising, who sat judging tennis balls in or out from high on a perch. But one among us who stretches like the net itself, wholly visible and there but to frame the attempt.\u201D That\u2019s pretty great. That\u2019s a theological statement. Yeah. I probably stole it from somewhere and I can\u2019t remember where. Well, Krista, it\u2019s one of those things. I see how many of the musicians, writers, poets that I have been devoted to my entire adult life, who are in no uncertain terms grappling with their spiritual lives, whether that\u2019s Flannery O\u2019Connor or Merton or James Wright or Rilke, who probably gets name-checked on your show more than almost anybody. Yeah. That\u2019s true. Yeah. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t call any song finished if I don\u2019t think that it somehow is vibrating with that awareness of how we live in spite of the inevitable, which is what all spirituality is, is how do we come into being? How do we live fully in the constant, conscious knowledge that we won\u2019t always? And how do you invest in any kind of idea of real commitment in the face of everything being finite? Yeah. And I think that every \u2014 in some way, every song that I write is awake to that awareness of that disparity. And I don\u2019t think anything else interests me at some level. Yeah. There\u2019s this \u2014 oh, the song that\u2019s in this album, \u201CEvery Sorrow.\u201D \u201CAfter every sorrow comes a joy, but every sorrow knows one more.\u201D And it ends with, \u201CAfter every sorrow comes a joy, and every story knows one more.\u201D And that\u2019s the gritty kind of manifestation of this struggle, tension, this big cosmic tension, right? That we kind of live with in all of our days and all of our relationships and\u2026 Well, we\u2019re sort of seduced into thinking that, like, here\u2019s life and then there\u2019s these bad things that can happen that are like obstacles that just fall into your road, as if the obstacle is not the road, you know? Right. We want to think that, all things being equal, we should be content all the time, and would be, except for these pesky flies that want to ruin every picnic, as if that isn\u2019t what the picnic is. It\u2019s that idea that you cut yourself off from great sorrow, you also cut yourself off from great joy. It\u2019s a simple enough idea that if you don\u2019t really understand\u2026 It\u2019s a simple enough idea. It\u2019s a hard enough reality. We only know any such thing as light because of darkness. I mean, it\u2019s fundamental. If you exorcise your demons, your angels will leave too. I mean, that\u2019s sort of the common wisdom, I think. You can listen again and share this conversation with Joe Henry through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, exploring the mystery and adventure of life and song with singer-songwriter Joe Henry. He\u2019s produced over a dozen albums of his own and for an array of other artists, including Ani DiFranco, Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt, Allen Toussaint and Billy Bragg. He\u2019s written songs together with Rosanne Cash and Madonna. This is \u201CGrave Angels\u201D from Joe Henry\u2019s 2014 album, Invisible Hour. You do use the imagery of angels a lot. It weaves in and out. Yeah. It\u2019s probably a bad habit. I mean, they\u2019re such faithful images, you know? Yeah. Well, and they\u2019re different. I mean, \u201CGrave Angels\u201D is the title of a song, and that is\u2026 The angels have gotten nicer, by the way. Have they? I have a song on an album called Fuse from 1999, I think. And there\u2019s a song called \u201CAngels,\u201D and they\u2019re really nasty in that one. I\u2019ve also \u2014 here\u2019s \u201CPlainspeak:\u201D \u201CBlood-lusty angels looking to rumble in town.\u201D What are you \u2014 I mean, in this \u201CSparrow\u201D song, which I love so much: \u201CI wait for one grave angel, and I know she waits for me.\u201D What is that? Do you know? What are the angels? What is that image about? I guess the angels are just this concept of needing to visualize some way in which the higher powers might be loving and benevolent even when we don\u2019t deserve it, you know? But yeah, I think the angels might \u2014 may be, kind of in literary terms, being a bit of the brokers between the earthly and the divine. They\u2019ve got a foot in both streams. Yeah. So, you and I are very close in age. We were both born in 1960, right? I was born in November and\u2026 I was born in December. \u2026in December. Yeah. We were just starting to take in world events, and so much of it was just unbelievably tragic. It was. Personally tragic. Even the public events were personal tragedies. Well, interesting. I think my earliest memory \u2014 and I subscribe to when John Cage said, \u201CThe past doesn\u2019t influence me, I influence it.\u201D I know I\u2019m constantly reimagining my past and assigning different significance to it. It\u2019s completely in play all the time. But I have a memory, and I think it\u2019s my earliest one if it\u2019s accurate, of laying on the floor underneath the ironing board as my mother ironed and watched Kennedy\u2019s funeral on T.V. Oh. And the reason I remember \u2014 and I can remember looking up at the end at the foam lining underneath her ironing board and understanding that she was upset. Yeah. And that somebody had died. Right. And I remember saying to her, \u201CDoes this mean you\u2019re going to die someday?\u201D And she said, \u201CYes, it does.\u201D And then I said, \u201CDoes that mean I\u2019m going to die someday?\u201D She said, \u201CYes, you are, honey.\u201D Wow. But I moved Atlanta after that and was living in Atlanta when Dr. King was killed. I mean, he was killed in Memphis, but he lived in Atlanta. His church was in Atlanta, of course. And I have really visceral memory of that particular time. And certainly as I got a bit older, more and more I tried to erase my Southern background from my sense of self. And it took a long time to be able to find how that is a significant part of who I am, and to be \u2014 I\u2019m proud about a lot of things about my upbringing. But I have a hard time still connecting myself to the South as I understood it in that moment. You don\u2019t do much that\u2019s overtly political, I don\u2019t feel. But you do care about public life, common life \u2014 really, really liking talking about common life these days. You actually wrote a book about Richard Pryor, which I don\u2019t even know how to talk about that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go into that. It\u2019s just \u2014 but the \u201CScar.\u201D \u201CScar\u201D begins with, \u201CRichard Pryor Addresses the Nation.\u201D I mean they\u2019re just these lines like, \u201CThe blade of our outrageous fortune. Like a parade, it cuts a path. Light shows on our foolish way and darkness on our aftermath.\u201D I mean, I don\u2019t know what you were writing about there, but to me it\u2019s very resonant as a nation. I mean, that song \u201CScar\u201D is an anomaly for me in that \u2014 I say I can count on less than a hand how many times I\u2019ve written a song and knew, when I was writing it, what I was writing about. I have a few of those experiences. And when you talk about the political, the album that I put out after 9/11 \u2014 the first record I would have made after 9/11 was called Tiny Voices, which is a very chaotic sort of record and sonically messy, as it had to be. And I think, in a lot of ways, very overtly political. There\u2019s a song on there called \u201CFlag\u201D that is about nationalism. And when I was writing the song, I knew there was something about it I thought was significant to me as a song. But I could not abide the way in which I thought it was so overtly political and of this moment. I was traveling a few years ago. I spent about three weeks traveling in Europe with Harry Belafonte helping him. Well, I first came into his orbit \u2014 he was asking for some musical help when he was finishing the film documentary of his life. I have to be careful here because I could talk about this for about an hour because a lot of mystical things happened to me surrounding Mr. Belafonte, but\u2026 Well, just tell me one, maybe. Well, he\u2019s a very, as you know, he\u2019s a very politically \u2014 savagely politically active person. And God bless him. He\u2019s walked that walk his entire professional life. He\u2019s a remarkable person and a true blessing to be in his company for an extended period of time. But one night, we were up late in the hotel bar in Berlin when we were travelling together at a big table of people, a lot of conversations going on. He overheard me talking about this and saying that I didn\u2019t allow political content to surface in my songs. I wouldn\u2019t abide it. And he stopped conversation and spoke in that whisper that everybody hears. Right. And really dressed me down about it. And said he didn\u2019t give a what I meant to say. It\u2019s what the song meant to say. I didn\u2019t have any right not to let the song say what the song needed to say. And I should take myself out of it. And then he asked me if I wanted to walk home. Because we were in Berlin, of course. Wow. And he was \u2014 and he really challenged me. And I really did go back and think a lot about the inherent vanity of trying to \u2014 of thinking at all about how a song made me look. That as a writer, I was not allowed to have an opinion about that. Or it was a mistake to. It was a diversion \u2014 a distraction to have that opinion. I\u2019ve had a few conversations lately with musicians who are different from you, but \u2014 the folk singers, the Indigo Girls talking about how they and others they\u2019re in conversation with, or \u2014 wondering if they need to create a new \u2014 whatever our version would be of the tradition of Pete Seeger. The song, the music that was not just the soundtrack for the Civil Rights Movement but really powered it in many ways. Well, the danger in our culture is that anything that becomes ubiquitous becomes frequently invisible and then meaningless to people. And that\u2019s probably more true now than it was then. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought a lot about. And when I was traveling with Harry in Europe, the film project that we were researching together \u2014 he wants to make a documentary about violence but most specifically about how the hip-hop movement, which he was instrumental in allowing to flourish \u2014 how it went from being a very communal tradition to being so much about violence and degradation of women and degradation of self. And he went on this trip, and I was in his company. And in Paris and in Berlin and in London, he was meeting with the most significant hip-hop artists and challenging them. They thought they were being summoned to sort of be anointed by Harry. Right. And he sat there with cameras running. They had agreed to be interviewed, and he would begin by saying, \u201CWhy have you allowed your music \u2014 your vocabulary to be co-opted?\u201D It was incredible. It was amazingly intense. And it was not comfortable. And it was incredible to see because Harry looks at the power of folk song in particular. Yeah. But the political power and the unifying power of all folk music, which, in his mind, and I agree with him, hip-hop was folk music in that moment in that community. Yeah. Yeah that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s his point of view. And you\u2019re letting it be defanged. You\u2019re letting its authority be co-opted and used against you. And I think a lot of us have allowed that. So, just coming back to this very notable feature of your work of kind of a self-aware evolution. And again, I mean, I\u2019m going to read you some lines. And I have no idea if that\u2019s what this \u2014 you meant by it, but the \u201CSparrow\u201D song\u2026 \u201CIt wasn\u2019t peace I wanted, so it wasn\u2019t peace I found. I wouldn\u2019t stand for reason, and it never would sit down.\u201D That\u2019s the kind of observation one makes about one\u2019s \u2014 that one\u2019s only able to make about oneself, whatever the context of that was. And I guess I appreciate how you are being so self-aware about this process of moving through life and getting to a place where you can see things you couldn\u2019t see before. Well, it\u2019s essential. How close any of us get to it on any given day is up for grabs. Some days, I feel like I have a very good aerial view. Yeah. I\u2019m the lifeguard above the pool, and I can see everything for better and worse. Plenty of days, I feel like I\u2019m chin deep in the middle of that water. And I don\u2019t know how deep it is. And I am, in fact, a lousy swimmer. Yeah. That\u2019s more like it. I have the desire to be aware. But, I mean, that\u2019s half the battle. I just \u2014 I kind of feel like you, like me, are fascinated by this process. I was just talking to my daughter the other day because I was \u2014 I wasn\u2019t complaining about something about being older, but she heard it as complaining. I was just \u2014 I was noting something about being older. And she\u2019s like, \u201COh, mom. I wish you just \u2014 I just wish you wouldn\u2019t think about those things.\u201D And I said, \u201CI don\u2019t think you understand.\u201D I used to hear people talk about \u2014 older people talk about being older, and it disturbed me. I felt like, why are they focusing on that? Like they were highlighting what was wrong. And now I realize that the process of growing older is so fascinating. I mean, you talk about it because it\u2019s really interesting. Yeah. And I think you \u2014 as we get older, you come into some true ownership. I think when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re inclined to believe \u2014 invited to believe that you couldn\u2019t have done anything significant enough to own an identity, a point of view. And then you get to a point when you\u2019re just like, \u201CWell, I think I\u2019m basically who I am now.\u201D Yeah. \u201CAnd whatever this is \u2014 however I can work from this as a base of operations, this finite mass, I\u2019m going to.\u201D And there\u2019s a liberation that comes with getting to a point where you think, \u201CI\u2019m not waiting for that next great shoe to drop.\u201D Both the shoes may be laying here. And this might be what there is. And there\u2019s terrific liberation in acknowledging what is. That idea of actually seeing in real time, this. And our culture does not know how to encourage that kind of thinking. We don\u2019t know how to teach young people, I don\u2019t believe, to think about \u2014 everything is about later. Yeah. I watch my dear daughter going through her senior year of high school, and everything\u2019s been about \u2014 or last year in particular \u2014 everything about SAT scores. Everything is like \u2014 you know you\u2019re having an experience right now that I hope is not completely lost on you because everybody has you so anxious about, \u201CWhat next?\u201D You\u2019re invited just to check things off the list just to say that you\u2019ve done them as opposed to actually having experience and giving that any value. I mean, here\u2019s a great line from \u201CSlide:\u201D \u201CI\u2019m learning more than I intended, try not to though I might. We\u2019re dying to be other, but we kill not to become. Grief sides with glory, they laugh deep into the night. Learning more than they intended, try not to though they might.\u201D I do think\u2026 That\u2019s so wise. I do think there\u2019s only a certain amount we really want to know. I mean, I really believe so. It\u2019d be \u2014 we think it would be impossible to continue if we actually had the teacher\u2019s edition of the book with the answers in the back. Yeah. And it\u2019s also just a kind of inborn contradiction in us. It\u2019s this weird human condition. Well, we all know we\u2019re going to die. But we\u2019ve made a pact with each other to pretend that we don\u2019t know that until absolutely necessary. So even when you\u2019re 91-year-old aunt dies, you go, \u201COh, my God, she died?\u201D Yeah. You know? Like, you didn\u2019t think she was gonna? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with singer-songwriter Joe Henry. You know, that place of being at peace with this, with what is, which does become easier with age \u2014 it\u2019s not that it makes you get everything \u2014 start getting everything right. But maybe it opens you to learning more than you intended. Right? It just makes that a little bit less painful, less surprising, and more welcome when it comes. And we jettison a lot of the distraction that\u2019s taken up a lot of space on your hard drive that you can really clear the field a bit. I mean, I\u2019m ashamed to think, in my early professional life, how much time I wasted and how much agony I allowed based on being treated poorly by an industry that advertises itself and brags about how poorly they treat people. Right. I mean, it\u2019s just a fact. But you still took it personally. I took it personally. And I wasted a lot of time. I spent a lot of significant time hurt over all the ways in which I was not being acknowledged by the people with whom I was trying to be in business. And I look back now just think, \u201CHow did I not see through that?\u201D But that\u2019s what we do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve read books. I\u2019ve heard other stories of musicians who I admired terrifically, who are much more gifted than myself, and who suffered much more indignity than I\u2019ve ever been asked to suffer. And yet, you still \u2014 we push on as if we\u2019re supposed to be exempt, and then we\u2019re shocked when we learn that we\u2019re not. I think that\u2019s a good \u2014 I kind of wanted to come back around to Thomas Merton. And you also quoted Thomas Merton. And I think this follows on what you just said about that you were moved by this \u2014 these lines of him that if you \u2014 who are you writing for? Like, \u201CIf you write for God, you will reach many men and bring them joy. If you write for men, you may make some money, and you may give someone a little joy, and you may make a noise in the world for a little while. If you write only for yourself, you can read what you yourself have written, and after ten minutes you\u2019ll be so disgusted that you will wish that you were dead.\u201D And there you go, using \u2014 talking about God again. But I did just want to ask you, what was it about that captured you and spoke to you in terms of what you\u2019ve learned about who you\u2019re writing for and why? Oh, I know that when I read that, it related instantly in my mind to something that I had read earlier from Buckminster Fuller of whom I am a terrific admirer. And as an inventor, as a philosopher, as an architect, as a social scientist, his thought was, \u201CI am exponentially more successful when I am working for the good of the most people. When I was trying to serve myself, I wasn\u2019t successful at all. When I worked to benefit ten people, I was that much more successful. When my work was to benefit a thousand people, I was that much more successful. And when I thought that the work that I was doing would benefit all mankind, I was infinitely beyond my imagination successful.\u201D And when I read that from Merton, I thought it was sort of the same idea. As soon as I am taking my focus off my own finite being and pointing my lens out, I\u2019m still filtering my work through my own experience. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s impossible not to. But, if as a writer, as any kind of creator, if you look within, that\u2019s a very finite space. If you use that lens to look out and use your experience to look at everything else, it\u2019s infinite. And I think when I \u2014 Merton saying that was the most concrete I\u2019d ever heard that stated. Because I\u2019ve certainly written things that the next morning I read and wished I was dead. But maybe you loved them the night before when you first wrote them. Right? Oh, of course you do. But there\u2019s nuance there because to write for all mankind, as Buckminster Fuller says, or to write for God, as Thomas Merton says, is not necessarily about having the highest profile thing, right? It\u2019s not necessarily about having the biggest thing or being the celebrity, right? Yeah, apparently not. Yeah, so\u2026 Yeah but it is about just\u2026 It\u2019s more about intention. Yeah, and that intention is to free yourself of your own vanity. And vanity in the great sense of the word, not just the way that we use it so colloquially now. But the idea of everything having to reflect back on you. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you do. And I think there\u2019s a way to let truth and insights and words and songs come through you and be shaped by everything you are and know, but not have you at the center of the equation. I mean, we all want it to be pretty. Back to Bucky Fuller, I remember him saying to a group of young architects students \u2014 he said, \u201CQuit thinking about beauty \u2014 making anything beautiful. Put it out of your mind. If you\u2019re designing a structure for somebody, if the structure is sound, and it\u2019s realizable, and it\u2019s feasible for them, and it serves the purpose, and they can afford to do it, it will be beautiful. You can\u2019t miss beauty.\u201D And in the same way that I think that the rawest, most brutal parts of our humanity are \u2014 nonetheless, can be incredibly beautiful if we\u2019re willing to see it that way. That\u2019s the great disparity. What\u2019s the great quote from Tom Waits where he said, \u201CI love beautiful melodies telling me terrible things.\u201D Yeah. Right. Yeah. I might have gotten that a little bit wrong. But that idea that when we can really embrace every bit of our humanity, even the parts that shame us the most, I mean, there\u2019s such great beauty in being cracked open. How much beauty is there in our brokenness. And if that\u2019s not a good summary for what I look for in a song, I don\u2019t know what is. OK. Joe Henry has recorded many albums, including Invisible Hour, and produced dozens of other artists. His forthcoming album, in collaboration with Billy Bragg, is Shine A Light: Field Recordings From The Great American Railroad. This is Joe Henry singing \u201CSparrow\u201D at the On Being studios on Loring Park. You can download this song and also watch his performance in its entirety at onbeing.org."
