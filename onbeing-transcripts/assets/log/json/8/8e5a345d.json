  "fullText": "Krista Tippett, host: This is Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, the meaning of faith. In our time some associate the word religion with rigid dogma and the excesses of institutions. The word spirituality, on the other hand, can seem to have little substance or form. The word faith can appear as a compromise of sorts, pointing to the content of religious tradition and spiritual experience. The truth is, all of these words are vague in the abstract. They gain meaning in the context of human experience. This hour, we\u2019ll crack open the connotations of the word faith in four traditions and lives. Later, we\u2019ll speak with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner and best selling author and unconventional Christian, Anne Lamott. We\u2019ll hear stories of Muslim theologian, Omid Safi. We begin with Sharon Salzberg. She is one of a small circle of Americans who discovered Buddhism, studied in Asia with great Buddhist teachers and brought this tradition to mainstream America in the 1970s. In 1976, she co-founded the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, one of the most prominent Buddhist centers in the Western world. And now she has written a book called \u201CFaith,\u201D which she quickly admits is not a notion commonly associated with Buddhism. It is an unusual word to associate with Buddhist teaching, and yet certainly it\u2019s intrinsic to the path he taught because it\u2019s that moment which \u2014 which said, `I\u2019m going to try,\u2019 that movement of our heart that says, `Yes, this can be for me.\u2019 I think that we all rely on that kind of faith every single day. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. And that\u2019s faith. And \u2014 and so it\u2019s essential to the undertaking of any kind of spiritual life. Sharon Salzberg was raised Jewish, and in her childhood she experienced a series of losses which might have destroyed faith of any kind. But Buddhism embraces suffering as a fact of human life, and that captivated her. I wanted to know how Sharon Salzberg got to this point; that after decades of practicing and teaching Buddhism, she wants to encourage delight in the word `faith\u2019; `to help reclaim faith,\u2019 she writes, `as fresh, vibrant, intelligent and liberating.\u2019 When I first started writing the book, which was about five years ago, and I told people I wanted to write a book on faith, I was met with chagrin and amusement and dismay and even anger and\u2026 Right. \u2026because so many people associated that word with a loss of self-respect and just succumbing to the vision of truth of another, whether it was another person or a tradition or a kind of blind adherence to dogma and\u2026 Then you recount this class that you taught in Los Angeles, where you \u2014 you wanted to use the word and everyone came forward with their story\u2026 Yeah. Yeah. \u2026and `faith\u2019 was really a word they experienced to be destructive and damaging. Yes, very much so, where you could not ask questions, you could not speak your mind, you could not express your doubt. And \u2014 and that was the \u2014 the climate that I met a lot when I told people I wanted to write a book on faith. For me, faith has a lot to do with courage, and it\u2019s the courage to step forward into the unknown and, first of all, to admit that we don\u2019t know. You know, we can \u2014 we can be so afraid to admit that and \u2014 and try to be in control of absolutely everything. And to actually admit we don\u2019t know, and yet to say, `You know, I have the strength to go forward anyway and to embrace what happens and to have an open-hearted participation in life,\u2019 you know, for me, that\u2019s a meaning of faith. Talk to me about what you have learned, what connotations the word or at least the \u2014 the word as translated has, you know, in your tradition. I mean \u2014 in Pali, it ha \u2014 it has different connotations I think even in the vocabulary when you\u2019re using the word, right? Well, sometimes it\u2019s translated \u2014 the word in Pali, which is the language of the original Buddhist text, is saddha, S-A-D-D-H-A, and sometimes it\u2019s translated as faith, sometimes as trust, sometimes as confidence or clarity, even devotion. In fact, when I was \u2014 back in the days when I was still writing and \u2014 and telling people I was writing a book on faith, one of my friends said to me, `Well, why don\u2019t you give yourself a break and just call the book \u201CTrust,\u201D you know, and you won\u2019t have all those reactions?\u2019 That would be easier. `It would be a lot easier, you know?\u2019 I like that. Yeah. But there\u2019s something in me that did want to reclaim the word, you know, \u2019cause it\u2019s so powerful a word and \u2014 and so misunderstood. I wanted us to be able to use it in a way that honored its incredible power because, in Buddhist teaching, faith isn\u2019t a commodity that we either have or we don\u2019t have and, if we don\u2019t have enough or we don\u2019t have the right kind, we\u2019re going to be condemned maybe forevermore. But, instead, faith is \u2014 it\u2019s like a journey and it\u2019s an unfolding of the heart that\u2019s based on love for ourselves and being able to reach out to others and let others reach out to us, to have a bigger picture of life where there\u2019s a sense of belonging and \u2014 and connection instead of feeling so alone and apart. There\u2019s this \u2014 the word saddha also \u2014 is that literally `to place the heart upon\u2019? Mm-hmm. Yeah, that\u2019s the literal translation. Yeah, there\u2019s this wonderful connection that Buddhism makes between the heart and the mind. It doesn\u2019t take them apart in a way, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, they\u2019re actually the same word. It\u2019s the same word. It\u2019s exactly the same word\u2026 Right. \u2026as, interestingly enough, anger and fear are the same word. They\u2019re exactly the same word. I\u2019m just trying to think about how that also fills the \u2014 the \u2014 the notion with a different kind of meaning. Yeah. Well, I think, you know, `to place the heart upon\u2019 depends on certain prior realizations. One is that we have a heart, and the other is that it\u2019s our conviction, it\u2019s our energy, and the kind of split that we experience is \u2014 is more of a Western notion certainly than Asian. In every Buddhist language, it\u2019s the same word for heart and mind, but I think the understanding of faith is very different. It involves these different phases in Buddhist teaching. The first phase is called bright faith\u2026 Right. \u2026where the experience may be that \u2014 you know, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve been sitting in a dark and enclosed room with the door shut and we feel that sense of confinement, and then the door swings open and the light comes in and we realize it\u2019s a big world out there. And maybe we meet a teacher who moves us very much, who inspires us, or we read a passage or a book or we\u2019re in a circumstance with the community, something happens so that we feel lifted out of the circumstance of our life, and we have the sense of immense possibility and we fall in love basically. You know, we have to name this, that in \u2014 I think in English or in our culture, when we talk about faith, we have this association of faith in something \u2014 Right?\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026faith in God and when you\u2019re thinking about bright faith or \u2014 or \u2014 or as your faith matures. Hell me how you think about it differently. How does that work? Well, I think there\u2019s both \u2014 there are both things. There is the act of faith, which is really fascinating to explore regardless of what we have faith in because that says something about ourselves, you know? It says something about our sense of moving into the center of possibility and not just deferring that to somebody else. You know, like, we could sit around and say, `Well, isn\u2019t that great? The Buddha got enlightened 2,500 years ago,\u2019 you know. But it\u2019s that moment of saying, `What does that mean for me?\u2019 What was the geography of your faith in that life you were leading in India as you were discovering it? What did it look like? What were its characteristics, and, you know, what were the experiences that you would call experiences of faith? Oh, I was \u2014 I was incredibly happy, and I think I had faith in various things. You know, I had faith in the Buddha, not as a \u2014 a godlike figure because he\u2019s not, but as a human being who had accomplished something that any human being really would \u2014 would want, you know, to live with that much understanding and freedom of mind and boundless compassion. I had faith in the way that he described the dharma because that was really honoring the truth of each moment. It was saying that each moment\u2019s experience was a part of the path and\u2026 Sort of a way of being in the world, right? Is that\u2026 Yeah. OK. Completely. You know \u2014 and \u2014 and faith in the community that had preserved the teachings and also had sprung up around me. You know, it was \u2014 for the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t really feel completely alone. It was a quality of happiness that meant that the present moment\u2019s circumstance, even though they were challenging, were not defining the state of my heart. Sharon Salzberg is a Buddhist teacher and author of a new book on faith. She embraced Buddhism in India and later in this country at places like the Naropa Institute in Colorado, which brought Asia\u2019s great Buddhist teachers to Americans. In Buddhism, she says, one stage of mature faith is called verified faith. The Buddha said over and over and over again, `Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything just because I said it. Don\u2019t believe anything just because you\u2019ve read it in a sacred text.\u2019 He said, `Put it into practice. Put it into practice and see for yourself if it\u2019s true.\u2019 And I\u2019m not sure I really wanted that when I was in India. You know, I was very young and I just wanted somebody to kind of hold me and keep me safe and tell me what to \u2014 to believe and what not to believe. And \u2014 and yet having come into a Buddhist tradition, all I heard over and over again was, `Don\u2019t believe anything. Put it into practice.\u2019 It\u2019s almost like \u2014 ironically enough, the movement from bright faith to verified faith is a movement that involves learning how to doubt. And so it\u2019s based on the feeling that we have both the right and the capacity to know for ourselves what is true. And all of my teachers just insisted on that, even though I didn\u2019t like it very much. You wanted them to tell you \u2014 they \u2014 you wanted them to give you a definitive truth. Absolutely. You know, I wanted them to tell me what was true and hold me to a certain standard of belief\u2026 Right. \u2026you know, to say, `Well, to be a good Buddhist, you know, you\u2019re going to have to believe these 15 things, and \u2014 and don\u2019t ever ask about them.\u2019 You know, this is \u2014 we\u2019re breaking a stereotype here because you\u2019re saying that doubt and questioning are built into faith itself. They are part of the same thing. Yes. And you have this wonderful line. I love this: `Questioning means longing to know the truth deeply and insisting that we can.\u2019 I think that when we look deeply into the meaning of faith, which has a lot to do with connection \u2014 you know, it\u2019s connecting to our own deepest strengths so that we\u2019re not defined by this circumstance we find ourselves in in any given day. And then if the essence of faith is connection, then the opposite of that really would be not doubt but a state of despair. The opposite of faith is despair. Yeah, I think that\u2019s really true. I also think it\u2019s important that you \u2014 you acknowledge the fact that we do have beliefs and that we need beliefs and that we \u2014 you know, as human beings, we hold them and our traditions hold them. You know \u2014 and I \u2014 I was intrigued. You \u2014 you \u2014 you recount an incident where you were teaching at the Naropa Institute in Colorado \u2014 Right? \u2014 and you talked about a \u2014 you know, a real disagreement; that there is a different belief between, for example, Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism between what happens after death. And it \u2014 it\u2019s simply that the two interpretations of that are different. And you talk about a fight. And I, you know \u2014 and I think we have a lot of images in our society of Christians fighting or Jews fighting, but not so much of Buddhists fighting. Buddhists fighting. Well, I think \u2014 you know, and I think it\u2019s good to know that that happens, too, and \u2014 and I think you\u2019re saying that those beliefs can be discarded, right? Well, I don\u2019t think, really, we can discard beliefs. I think that everything really depends on how we use them. And the example at Naropa Institute was a perfect example, where I was in a discussion with somebody from the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism and I had been much more highly trained in the Taravadan tradition. And they do hold two different belief systems about what happens after death, even though every Buddhist school posits a cycle of death and rebirth\u2026 Right. \u2026again and again. And that was what we were discussing, this person and I, and the discussion became quite heated until we were virtually shouting at each other, and he said to me, `Well, you\u2019re just lying,\u2019 you know, and he walked away. And I was kind of shocked but \u2014 but the truth was, I mean, how would either of us know, you know, what happens after death? And \u2014 and even a deeper truth was probably that \u2014 my guess is that we were two people in some way afraid to die. And rather than discussing honestly the vulnerability of that emotion, we were masking it in these belief systems and \u2014 and trying to feel in control, you know, by knowing or seeming to know. And \u2014 and that\u2019s the problem with beliefs \u2014 is that when we hold them that tightly and we use them to hide what we\u2019re feeling, then, of course, they don\u2019t take us onward to a state of greater faith. They become something else. Sharon Salzberg\u2019s book is Faith: Trusting Your Own Deepest Instincts. The word `faith\u2019 gained new currency in Christian vocabulary with the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. In criticizing the abuses of the Roman Catholic Church of that time, Martin Luther insisted that individual Christians did not have to go through the church to get to God but would be justified by their faith alone. Here is an excerpt from his introduction to the Book of Romans in his German Bible of 1522. `Faith is not what some people think it is. They think that when you hear the gospel, you start working, creating by your own strength a thankful heart which says, \u201CI believe.\u201D But because this is a human idea, a dream, the heart never learns anything from it, so it does nothing, and reform doesn\u2019t come from this faith. Instead, faith is God\u2019s work in us that changes us and gives us new birth from God. It brings the Holy Spirit with it. Yes, it is a living, creative, active and powerful thing, this faith.\u2019 From the writings of the German church reformer Martin Luther, in 1592. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith. Today we\u2019re exploring what the word `faith\u2019 means in particular vocabularies and lives. How is faith distinct from religious belief? You can watch Jews self-destruct in front of your very eyes if you ask them what they believe in because nothing in their religious tradition or culture has taught them what would be an acceptable answer. My next guest, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, has been called one of the most creative spiritual thinkers of our time. He is a rabbi in the Reform tradition of Judaism and the author of many beloved books. When I sat down to speak with him about different understandings of the word `faith,\u2019 I told him that I had a sense `faith\u2019 is not as resonant a word in a Jewish vocabulary as it is in a Christian one and certainly not one used as often. He agreed, and he confessed that if he heard the title of this show, Speaking of Faith, knowing nothing, he might imagine that it is an exclusively Christian program. But he then proceeded to give me some of the most compelling definitions of faith which I ever hoped to hear. Within his stories, I also find pointed distinctions between faith and doubt, belief and religion. I was once working with a group of Jewish junior high school kids. This must have been 25, 30 years ago. And I asked them if they believed in God. And I was hoping, as a good teacher, that some would say yes and some would say no, and it would be a neat discussion. But no one said he or she did. And I was \u2014 I was devastated. I mean, they didn\u2019t even s\u2026 That \u2014 that they didn\u2019t. They \u2014 yeah, they \u2014 I \u2014 `No, I don\u2019t believe in God,\u2019 like \u2014 like, `No, it\u2019s not raining out.\u2019 You know, it was \u2014 I remember being devastated. I \u2014 I remember thinking, `So it\u2019s come to this, 3,000 years of piety and struggle and agony for a bunch of obnoxious little suburban kids that don\u2019t believe in God.\u2019 And I \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to, you know, sort of wring their necks, and I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what I did. I probably did the equivalent of falling back a few yards to punt. And then later on in the discussion, I don\u2019t know where it came from, I said, `By the way, how many of you kids have been close to God?\u2019 And, so help me, every kid raised his hand. And that was a very eye-opening experience for me. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I realized that Jews will say, `I\u2019ve been close to God, but I\u2019m not sure I believe in God.\u2019 If \u2014 if you ask a Jew, `Do you or do you not believe in God?\u2019 you\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re likely to regard it as something that\u2019s put to them by the House Un-American Activities Committee. You know, it\u2019s like, `May I speak to my attorney? I\u2019m not sure, you know.\u2019 But \u2014 but if you say, `Have you been close to God?\u2019 `Oh, well, yeah, I was close last Shabbat when Mother lit the candles, or, you know, when somebody I loved died, I was aware that the \u2014 the texture of religious time was different and that I was more intimate with the source of holiness in the universe.\u2019 I had a professor at rabbinic school. His name was Samuel Sandmel. He \u2014 he wrote widely about Jewish and Christian issues. He was a beautiful man. And he was from the South; he spoke with a Southern accent. And he used to say to us, `Gentlemen\u2019 \u2014 in those days, it was only men \u2014 `Gentlemen, if you don\u2019t seriously doubt the existence of God every couple of weeks, you are theologically comatose.\u2019 Well, I \u2014 I think that that sums up neatly Jewish attitudes toward belief in God. Yeah. Now faith, as you say, I think is a \u2014 a much bigger category than belief or not belief. I think faith, to me as a Jew, means an abiding trust that the way things are working out is part of something bigger and probably incomprehensible, but just knowing that it\u2019s part of a larger constellation of meaning, it is a kind of comfort and a kind of succor and solace for a Jew. You wrote, `One reason we find talking about God so difficult is we are part of what we are trying to understand.\u2019 What makes that harder to talk about? It \u2014 it pushes the edge of language. No, but you\u2019re absolutely right. I mean, one of the reasons that Speaking of Faith is such a slippery and \u2014 and a moving target is because we\u2019re trying to talk about the stuff of which we are. We\u2019re trying to take consciousness and turn it back on itself. I think that that may be a good example also \u2014 something that I was thinking about as I thought about speaking with you is how action-oriented Judaism is, right? I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s organized around deeds and not beliefs. As we\u2019ve been saying, this word `faith\u2019 and maybe even the way Christians often present themselves in public has so much to do with \u2014 with beliefs, you know, and\u2026 Judaism, I think, Krista, is an incorrigibly behaviorist tradition. It seems to have given up on trying to positively identify or clarify the ultimate motive behind any deed. Right. I mean, everybody agrees that the ultimate motive should be to do the deed because it\u2019s what God wants you to do, but it\u2019s so hard to figure out what would get somebody to do the deed for all the other reasons. The Jews finally just gave up and said, `Just shut up and deal. Just do the next thing.\u2019 Just do the right thing \u2014 Right?\u2026 J \u2014 do what you\u2019re supposed to do. \u2026whether you want to or not, whether you believe it or not. I don\u2019t believe \u2014 but I don\u2019t believe it \u2014 the answer is just do it \u2019cause if you wait till you believe it, hell could freeze over. And it\u2019s better you should do the right thing whether you believe it because I think Jewish psychology would believe that personality and what we\u2019re calling faith follows deed\u2026 Yes. \u2026follows right action. And at that point, it might \u2014 it might be an interesting concept \u2014 Right? \u2014 faith that follows action. Yeah. Jews would say, `What do I believe? Well, let\u2019s see, I went to synagogue pretty regularly. I gave charity. I studied the holy books. I was a good person. Well, my God, look at that. I \u2014 I think I\u2019m a person of faith.\u2019 Rabbi Lawrence Kushner. After a short break, more conversation with him; also, Muslim theologian Omid Safi. Religion is hard these days. And many people are searching to find ways of affirming a more enlightened, more spiritual, more pluralistic understandings. And some people have talked about the term faith as one that opens up such a possibility. Also, unconventional born-again Christian, writer, Anne Lamott. Faith is a verb. I think, the difference between faith and religion, is that we believe in a variation of the Golden Rule or karma, that you get back what you put in. And that if you want apricots, you\u2019re not going to grow them from tomato seeds or arugula seeds. We\u2019re here to take care of one another. And it\u2019s really an action word, faith is. This is Speaking of Faith. On our website at speakingoffaith.org you\u2019ll find book and music lists and background on all the ideas on today\u2019s program. You can also sign up there for our e-mail newsletter, where I offer transcript excerpts and reflections on each week\u2019s show. That\u2019s speakingoffaith.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, conversation about belief, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, the meaning of faith. In recent decades in America, speech about faith has became a controversial enterprise. Stereotypically, strident religious voices dismiss other beliefs while proclaiming the rightness of their own. Some wonder if it\u2019s possible to hold deep religious beliefs and remain open to the virtues of pluralism. My guest, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner is a widely respected writer on Jewish tradition and spirituality. He\u2019s also participated in important interreligious conversations. He is at once open-hearted towards other traditions while thoroughly grounded in his own. Speaking of Faith, he insists, does not mean that we overlook differences. In fact, from his perspective, disagreement can be a way to honoring another. The way I be a human being is to be a human being of the male persuasion, and the way you be a human being is to be a human being of the female persuasion. We can\u2019t take our gender away out of some misguided attempt to realize our commonality. Our commonality comes from passionately clinging to our uniqueness and our individuality and our difference. And I \u2014 I remain convinced that \u2014 I start by telling you who I am and what I believe and arm wrestling with you, having a big fight about it. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s healthy. That\u2019s fun. I mean, in Jewish tradition, it\u2019s a mark of high respect. But I \u2014 I \u2014 I also expect that if you continue to be honest and I continue to be honest and we stay at it long enough, we\u2019ll discover that we each have one another\u2019s cards in our hands. And that would be Speaking of Faith. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, for Jews especially r \u2014 going back to the image I think we talked about earlier when \u2014 when I said that Jews regard the sacred text as so sacred it has an infinity of meanings, that also means that there are an infinity of arguments that are possible. Right. But I once, as a young rabbinic student, was having a cup of coffee on the Lower East Side. I had a big volume of Talmud, so I\u2019m easily identifiable as a serious Jewish student. And this Jew \u2014 some \u2014 some old Jew comes over wit \u2014 to the table with a cup of coffee. There weren\u2019t many people in the restaurant. It\u2019s the middle of the morning. He sees the book. He looks at me, he says, `So you, young man, how about an argument?\u2019 And I said, `I \u2014 but I believe in God.\u2019 He said, `I don\u2019t. Let\u2019s argue.\u2019 I mean, f \u2014 for Jews, because we have that sacred text in front of us, then each one is allowed to fly off in his or her own unique interpretive direction. And arguing about the meaning of text is a way that Jews have of bringing one another into being again and again. And tell me what it says about the nature of religious truth that \u2014 you know, you\u2019ve also written that spiritual truth wants to be spoken; that once you speak or show the words to someone else, then both of you are different. And what does that say about the nature of religious truth, about the ultimate reality that we\u2019re\u2026 Right now\u2026 \u2026confronting at the time? \u2026if you and I were really brave and really fortified and really spiritually secure and we dared open our hearts to one another, there\u2019s no telling what would happen to us as a result of this conversation. I would really have to listen to you, and I would have to be prepared for the possibility that you have something new to tell me I\u2019ve never heard before. And once I heard it, I would be different. And if you sensed that I had heard it and I was different, that would make you different, and then we\u2019d have to start all over again. You know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty messy, I think. I understand that. It\u2019s not going to happen often. No, I like it. I think it\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s happened. I think it\u2019s happened in this hour. And here\u2019s something that jumped out at me when I was reading you, and you quote \u2014 and I want to say this correctly \u2014 Rabbi Menachum Nachum of Chernobyl\u2026 Yes. \u2026Is that right? \u2014 an 18th\u2026 It\u2019s usually pronounced Chernobyl, but that\u2019s pretty good. Chernobyl. And that \u2014 and that\u2019s the Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union, or is that another Chernobyl? I think so, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean, the joke among the\u2026 An 18th-century mystic \u2014 yeah. The joke among the chassidim was \u2014 is that Chernobyl was glowing long before the nuclear reactor accident. OK, fine, so we just made a joke about it. But here\u2019s what jumped out at me, you know. He says, `There is nothing besides the presence of God. Being itself is derived from God, and the presence of the creator remains in each created thing.\u2019 And then you, you know, concluded that the apparent brokenness, disharmony and confusion that clutter the universe are illusory. But then that is a place that we now, a couple hundred years after he wrote that, associate with a terrible man-made disaster. At the end of the Book of Job, if I read it correctly, in the whirlwind speech \u2014 I think it\u2019s Chapter 38, 39 \u2014 God sort of shows Job the ultimate Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom video with lions ripping apart gazelles and vultures tearing carrion and hailstorms and earthquakes and all. And then God says to Job, `What do you think of that, Job? Hope you like it \u2019cause I\u2019m in that, too. Goodbye.\u2019 Right. That\u2019s a challenge to try to find sacredness in ever increasingly less likely places and events, which doesn\u2019t mean \u2014 I want to hasten to add that we are not still obligated to try to make the world the best place we can by whatever good talents and offices we have at our disposal. But it does mean that from a religious point of view, we\u2019re always considering the possibility that there\u2019s something bigger and holy coming down and that there may be a meaning even for that. I also have to say that when you tell that story, I think another reason we have to talk to each other about these things is that \u2014 is that we lose sight of that presence or s \u2014 or meaning. We can sometimes point out to each other that maybe there\u2019s something larger going on. Beautiful. Yes. Yes. I mean, that \u2014 that\u2019s the job of one religious person for another. It\u2019s very dangerous. I \u2014 I want to\u2026 Right. I \u2014 I want to again hasten to add that I \u2014 I say to my rabbinic students, `Don\u2019t try talking like this within 10 blocks of any hospital.\u2019 This is not pastoral, comforting theology. Rabbi and author Lawrence Kushner. His books include Honey From The Rock: An Introduction to Jewish Mysticism and Eyes Remade for Wonder. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and you\u2019re listening to Speaking of Faith, today exploring the meaning of faith. You can read more about this subject at speakingoffaith.org. Here is a passage a best-selling book on faith, Traveling Mercies written by my next guest, Anne Lamott. `A memory came to me then of our pastor, Veronica, telling us just the week before how she gets direction from God in prayer. She said that when she prays for direction, one spot of illumination always appears just beyond her feet, a circle of light into which she can step. She moved away from the pulpit to demonstrate, stepping forward shyly, this big-boned African-American woman tramping like Charlie Chaplin into an imagined spotlight. And then after standing there looking puzzled, she moved another step forward to where the light had gone, two feet ahead of where she had been standing and then again. \u201CWe in our faith work,\u201D she said, \u201Cstumble along toward where we think we\u2019re supposed to go, bumbling along, and here is what\u2019s so amazing: We end up getting exactly where we were supposed to be.\u201D\u2018 For more than a decade, sales of religious and spiritual titles have taken the publishing industry by storm. Speaking of religion is not confined to places of worship. More and more, as the prolific author Sister Joan Chittister likes to say, `People are also getting their faith off the shelves.\u2019 Still, even in this climate, Anne Lamott is hugely successful, and there is nothing predictable about her faith or the way she describes it. She is a recovering alcoholic, drug addict and bulimic. Part of her popular appeal is the frankness with which she forms theology out of raw experience. Sober people say that religion is for people who are afra \u2014 who are afraid to go to hell, and spirituality is for people who\u2019ve been there. And \u2014 and I think `faith\u2019 for me is a word that speaks much more to a belief and an interest in matters that are spiritual rather than the institution and creeds that you associate with religion. While drunk one day, Anne Lamott stumbled into a small biracial church in one of the poorest communities in California. And there she has stayed. She gave birth to her son Sam after an affair. Becoming a mother changed her life, as did her reluctant conversion to Christianity. She is very unlike Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, but she reminds me of him in the way she is a wide-open pluralist. She, however, is something of a Jesus freak, which might seem the most exclusive kind of Christian faith. I\u2019ve been very angry at God lately and \u2014 and basically not speaking to him or her and \u2014 but don\u2019t ever lose my faith in Jesus. Yeah. I talk to Jesus all the time. I\u2019m wearing a Mary medallion right now \u2019cause I also happen to really love Mary, although that\u2019s not a traditionally Protestant thing to do. There\u2019s a crucifix in the next town over that is \u2014 had \u2014 it\u2019s a very big wooden crucifix from, like, 400 years ago, and it has its \u2014 his arms blown off. And \u2014 and then there\u2019s a sign underneath it that says, `Jesus has no arms but ours to do his work and to show his love.\u2019 And my experience \u2014 and \u2014 and what I\u2019ve learned at my church mostly, which is half black and very Southern and very civil rights and \u2014 is that you can\u2019t know Jesus but through the children of God, the very troubled, screwed-up, kind of nutty people that \u2014 you know, nutty people are us, damaged people are us. And that\u2019s how I know Jesus is in very loving eyes and gentle hands and people that get out of themselves to become people for others which is sometimes me. Sometimes I\u2019m the one getting out on myself, and other times people have just given up what they really thought they needed to do to just come be with me or to take me up on the mountain or to the movies or \u2014 or have laying down on the floor with me when I was too sad to get up. You tell some stories in Traveling Mercies about faith and \u2014 and life with your son Sam. If I just ask you the question this way, you know, what do you think \u2014 how has being a mother changed your faith? First of all, having a child so kicks to pieces the illusion that you\u2019re in charge of much. What happened for me was that terrible, terrible miracle that my heart opened in a way it hadn\u2019t been opened before. And before I had a child, I felt like I had had a \u2014 a great life and a hard life. And I sort of felt like, `Hit me with your best shot,\u2019 \u2019cause I\u2019ve \u2014 was 35 when I delivered; I was 34 when I got pregnant. I felt like I\u2019ve lived hard. I\u2019d had a lot of books come out. I\u2019d had a lot of success. I\u2019d had some failure. I\u2019d had a million relationships. And when I had a \u2014 a baby, I became so desperate and clingy, and all I wanted was to live, you know, and raise my child and \u2014 and the main thing I wanted was just for him to outlive me. It\u2019s a little bit like with writing. It\u2019s like that wonderful line of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s, that writing is like driving at night with the headlights on and you can\u2019t see very far, but you can make the whole journey that way. And having a kid and being a woman of faith is \u2014 is \u2014 means that I \u2014 I can\u2019t see far, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out\u2026 Yeah. \u2026I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to see along the way, but I know that I\u2019ll be sustained and I know I won\u2019t be alone. `Sam is the only kid he knows who goes to church, who is made to go to church two or three times a month. He rarely wants to. I make him because I can. I outweigh him by nearly 75 pounds, but that is only part of it. The main reason is that I want to give him what I found in the world, which is to say a path and a little light to see by. Most of the people I know who have what I want, which is to say purpose, heart, balance, gratitude, joy, are people with a deep sense of spirituality. They are people in community who pray or practice their faith. They are Buddhists, Jews, Christians, people banding together to work on themselves and for human rights. They follow a brighter light than the glimmer of their own candle. They are part of something beautiful. I saw something once from The Jewish Theological Seminary that said, \u201CA human life is like a single letter of the alphabet. It can be meaningless, or it can be a part of a great meaning.\u201D Our funky little church is filled with people who are working for peace and freedom, who are out there on the streets and inside praying, and they are home writing letters and they are at the shelters with giant platters of food.\u2019 A reading from Traveling Mercies. Here again is the author, Anne Lamott. Faith is a verb. You know, it\u2019s, I think, the difference between faith and religion, and \u2014 and the verb is that we \u2014 what \u2014 what joins all of us in faith, all people of all faiths, I think, is that we \u2014 we believe in \u2014 in a variation of the Golden Rule or karma, that you get back what you put in. And that if you want apricots, you\u2019re not going to grow them from tomato seeds or arugula seeds, and that we\u2019re here to take care of one another and \u2014 and that if we want to have loving feelings, we need to do loving things; that it\u2019s really an action word, faith is, and that the truth of our spiritual identity is not dependent on circumstance. I believe we\u2019re children of God, and I believe this to be true about Jews and Muslims and Hindus and \u2014 and atheists. I just believe we were created by a loving \u2014 of the loving presence that we would call God or goodness or truth. And so the people of faith know that the \u2014 that if you just show up and you\u2019re willing to help and you\u2019re willing to help a tiny, tiny spiritual awakening such as that you don\u2019t kill yourself that day or try to kill anybody else, that things are going to work out and they\u2019re going to work out one day at a time, but they\u2019re also going to work out tribally. But you keep doing \u2014 in one and the same breath, you\u2019ll \u2014 you damn religion and then you\u2019re talking like the most religious person I\u2019ve ever spoken with. And, I mean, you\u2019re a wordsmith. You know what? Tell me what \u2014 what words and vocabulary pictures you want to throw out there when people think of religion, so that they start thinking of someone more like you perhaps. Just to clarify things for a second, I really believe that fundamentalism is the great evil in this \u2014 on this Earth right now an \u2014 from every different religious tradition. It\u2019s a conviction of \u2014 of being right and of feeling that we are chosen and that other people can be denied a seat at the banquet table, whereas I believe that people of faith and of \u2014 and spiritual communities understand that everybody is a child of God and everybody needs to be fed and that you just don\u2019t get to pick who you\u2019re going to sit with at the banquet, you know, so buckle your seat belt. I just want to tell you one quick story from church. OK. All right. On Sunday during the children\u2019s sermon, our pastor, Veronica, was teaching them about taking spiritual time-outs all day and that \u2014 that you could stop and close your eyes, and then she had them do that and she said, `What do you hear?\u2019 And they\u2019re all different ages from about three up till 12, and they\u2019re saying, `Oh, I hear a dog. I hear a radio. I hear someone singing. I hear the wind. I hear lots of birds.\u2019 And then this four-year-old boy said, `I hear the water at the edges.\u2019 And I thought, `Who\u2019s writing your stuff?\u2019 And then I wanted to go up to him and say, `Hey, can I use that? I\u2019m a writer. Can I use that? Were you going to use that?\u2019 And so it\u2019s like the water at the edges, I think, is a \u2014 is a \u2014 water holding us up is a great religious image from the Bible, which is mostly what I read spiritually, the \u2014 the sense of the baptism, the being washed clean in the water, the \u2014 the fact that it slakes our thirst, that in the Christian tradition it\u2019s living water \u2014 that the Holy Spirit is the living water poured into us, you know? Or in the \u2014 the story by J.D. Salinger. Remember that short story, \u201CTeddy\u201D? It\u2019s at the very \u2014 it\u2019s the very last story in the \u201CNine Stories.\u201D And it\u2019s a little boy who\u2019s a reincarnated lama, and he\u2019s being interviewed on this cruise ship. And \u2014 and the interviewer, who\u2019s, like, from the BBC or something, is saying, `Well, when did you first understand what this whole \u2014 that everything was God and that \u2014 that \u2014 that there was this great spiritual truth to our lives?\u2019 And this eight-year-old or nine-year-old boy in huge baggy Bermuda shorts says, `Well, one day I was watching my mother give my sister a glass of milk and I just could see that it was God pouring God into God.\u2019 And when that little kid said, `Oh, I hear the water at the edges,\u2019 I thought, `Yo, little man.\u2019 Anne Lamott is a born-again Christian and the author of many books, including Operating Instructions and Traveling Mercies. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is Speaking of Faith. Today, faith or religion? We end with Omid Safi, a professor of philosophy and religion at Colgate University and author of a new book, Progressive Muslims. Of all the major religious traditions, Islam, which stresses submission to the one God, would seem on the surface to be least inclined to distinguish between the human experience of faith and the practice of religion. But Omid Safi says it is not that simple. Instead, he suggests that faith is a good way to imagine the most hopeful possibilities for Islam in the coming years. The narrative that I\u2019d like to start off with is one from the Qur\u2019an. In this story, you have a group of nomads who come up to the prophet Mohammed. (Speaking Arabic) The desert Arabs say, the nomads say, `We have faith.\u2019 (Speaking Arabic) Instead, say to them, `No, you do not have faith.\u2019 `Instead,\u2019 only say, `We have submitted. We have attained to Islam.\u2019 (Speaking Arabic) `This is because faith has not yet entered into your hearts.\u2019 So in this narrative, you have a group of people who are boasting, in a sense, about having attained to faith. And the Qur\u2019an says no, there is no faith in your hearts. You might have begun the act of submitting yourself to God, of becoming Muslim, but you\u2019re not yet at the level of faith. In a strange way, it\u2019s possible to be formally Muslim without having actualized the beauty of faith. Omid Safi also shares one of the most famous narratives of the prophet Mohammed\u2019s life \u201CThe Hadith of Gabriel.\u201D In it, the prophet and his companions are approached by a stranger in very white clothing that shows no mark of his travels. The man behaves in an unaccountably familiar way with the prophet, seating himself so close to Mohammed their knees touch and, without introduction, demanding that the prophet teach him about Islam. The story continues with the prophet\u2019s answer. `Islam, submission to God, means that you bear witness that there is only one God and that Mohammed is his messenger. It means that you perform the prayer, you pay the charity tax, you fast during Ramadan and, if you\u2019re able to, you perform the pilgrimage to the Kaaba.\u2019 The man says, `You have spoken the truth.\u2019 And all the companions express surprise at the fact that he seems to be putting himself in a position of authority with respect to the prophet. The stranger says, `Now tell me about faith, about iman.\u2019 The prophet says, `Faith is that you have faith in God, the angels, the Scriptures, all the messengers and the last day.\u2019 Again, the stranger says, `You have spoken the truth.\u2019 And it\u2019s at this point that he introduces even a higher category, one that is called ihsan. It\u2019s almost impossible to translate this term into English. Some have suggested spiritual excellence. I prefer the term the actualization of goodness, the realization of beauty, which might be more accurate but it\u2019s a mouthful. At this point, the prophet says, `Ihsan is that you worship God as if you see him, as if you see God, and even if you don\u2019t see him, to remember that nonetheless he sees you.\u2019 The stranger goes through asking the prophet a few more questions and each time affirms that the prophet has spoken in truth. In the end, the prophet turns to his community and says, `Do you know who that stranger was?\u2019 The community expresses their ignorance. And he says, `That was Gabriel. He came to teach you your religion.\u2019 What\u2019s so interesting about the progression of this narrative is again you have a hierarchy where that which we ordinarily think of as religion, Islam, is only the first step. It\u2019s the lowest common denominator. After Islam comes faith, faith that illuminates one\u2019s heart. But one doesn\u2019t stop there. The highest point that one should aspire to is this quality of ihsan, of spiritual excellence, of actualizing goodness, of realizing beauty and that, of course, is a never-ending goal. It\u2019s to live life as if one sees God and, if we don\u2019t, to remember that he nonetheless sees us. These are powerful narratives and powerful passages. And one can hope that in this day and age, where there\u2019s so much fighting over religion and which religion is right and which religion is wrong, that people remember the qualities of faith and the qualities of spiritual excellence, and it\u2019s at that level that we can find a greater pluralism, a greater unity for humanity. Omid Safi is assistant professor of philosophy and religion at Colgate University. He is the editor of Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism.Earlier in this hour you heard author Anne Lamott, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, and Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg.
