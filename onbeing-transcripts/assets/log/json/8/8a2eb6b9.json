  "fullText": "I\u2019ve been reading Adam Gopnik with pleasure in the pages of The New Yorker for many years. He might be most widely known for his reporting from France and his book, Paris to the Moon. But I\u2019ve also enjoyed his lyrical fascination with everything from Renaissance art to food, from parenting to science and religion. And we touch on all these things in the conversation that follows. I decided to finally interview him when I read the foreword he\u2019s written to a new book, The Good Book, in which an array of intellectual and literary figures reflect on the Bible. Adam Gopnik sums up a core irony of our secular age in this way: \u201COur ancestors acknowledged doubt while practicing faith. We moderns are drawn to faith while practicing doubt.\u201D I think that the negation of God doesn\u2019t negate our morality, but the negation of God doesn\u2019t supply us with morality, either. That those are things that we have to make up for ourselves. And the only way we can make them is to remake them, is to go back to and ask again what are the values we inherit. Which ones count? Which ones don\u2019t? We may be ultimately in the universe on our own. But we are not on Earth newly born. We descend from long lines of people who\u2019ve asked similar questions. You can have \u2014 hold those two convictions simultaneously and passionately. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Adam Gopnik has been a staff writer, essayist, and commentator at The New Yorker since 1986. In addition to Paris to the Moon, he\u2019s authored a number of books for children and adults, including the wonderful volume Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life. It seems to me that you probably wouldn\u2019t say that you had a religious upbringing, but there was certainly a very rich religious background to your family and to your childhood. Would you say it that way? Yes. I think that\u2019s true. I mean, it\u2019s complicated, and manifold. On my mother\u2019s side of the family, I came from a long line of rabbis. That background, the rabbinical background, was very strong in my life. At the same time, my parents, by the standard turns and twists of generations, rejected the religious content of their own upbringing. So one of the strange things in my upbringing was that we celebrated Christmas with enormous intensity, because \u2014 it\u2019s a long and complicated story. One of my mother\u2019s relatives was actually Irish Catholic, and most of my early \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to call it, exactly \u2014 spiritual experiences derived from this very strange, and yet hardly idiosyncratic, because actually quite widespread, experience of a Jewish Christmas. But for me it was a portal to \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call it, Krista, without sounding a little crazy \u2014 it was a portal to thinking about numinous experience, and daily experience. One of the things that came to be hugely important to me was one of the kind of portals of my own experience of the numinous \u2014 the spiritual, call it what you will \u2014 was Christmas music, the Bach Christmas Oratorio, Handel\u2019s Messiah\u2026 Right. Right. \u2026Medieval carols, which ultimately then led me to the great Christian poetry of that time. And particularly W.H. Auden\u2019s great nativity poem\u2026 Yeah. \u2026\u201CFor the Time Being,\u201D which became a kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t want to call it a sacrament, but it certainly was then, when I was a kind of young man coming of age and, to this day, not just one of the great poems, but one of the poems that\u2019s most guided my own life. Can you say a little bit of that? Sure. He saw his own erotic experience, and by extension the mixed-up, and in every sense, screwed-up erotic experience that we all have, as one of the ways that spiritual experience is offered to us. And I wish I could remember, I don\u2019t have the poem in front of me now \u2014 but exactly to say that those of us whose experience of transcendence is rooted in our carnal passions, still have a place at this stable. That\u2019s essentially what\u2026 That\u2019s wonderful. \u2026what the poem says. Yeah. And, you know, the basic idea is that there\u2019s a very close, clandestine relationship between all of the miseries and joys of carnal love, and the truer miseries and joys of religious experience. Right. One thing I noticed as I started reading through the sweep of your work, also, you say\u00A0\u2014 you reflect in so many ways on the Bible and spiritual life, and what is numinous and, as you said, daily, and rational, and the contradictions between those things. And it also seemed to me that Darwin, that thinking about Darwin, reflecting on Darwin, being in dialogue with Darwin\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026is a real thread for you. And one of the things that you talk about, that you write so winsomely, and that I just find so intriguing is how Darwin has these notions of both \u201Cquick time\u201D and \u201Cdeep time.\u201D Mm-hmm. Yeah, I\u2019m touched that you saw it because that was an important idea for me that \u2014 you know how that it is, nobody noticed. Yes, I think that\u2019s true. One of the things that gives Darwin\u2019s life and his work its enormous, almost tragic, pathos is that he was aware \u2014 he became acutely aware of that. Evolution, biological evolution, only operates and only makes sense if you\u2019re able to open your mind up to geological time. Yeah. Unbelievable\u2026 Which you say, \u201Cthis vast abyss of time\u201D is how you wrote it, yeah. The vast abyss of time. And Darwin\u2019s whole point is it only takes place over these vast expanses of times that we can understand abstractly, but we can\u2019t experience. Yeah. And our own actual existence takes place in this tiny, brief lightning flash of existence. And that includes the life of ourselves, and of our loved ones, and of our children, particularly. And I talk in the book about his experience of his favorite daughter, Annie, and \u2014 who died tragically\u2026 Yeah. \u2026young. What an imprint that left\u2026 And there\u2019s no question\u2026 \u2026on him. Yes. And that rhythm, that pathos, that tension between our actual experience of the people we love, and the things that give meaning to our lives \u2014 so brief, so packed, something that only becomes more brief and more packed and more poignant as we age \u2014 against this limitless\u2026 Yeah. \u2026seeming span of time that\u2019s responsible for our particular forms and for our particular capacities. That\u2019s a kind of pathos in which Darwin is acutely aware. And it\u2019s essential, it seems to me, to for lack of a better word, the spiritual experience of modern people, that we have to have double vision of exactly that kind. Yeah. We have to be double-dyed. I mean, it kind of echoes back at what you said a minute ago about Auden, and this kind of interplay, this synergy between misery and love and kind of the human struggle between beauty and terror that is also there in religion. And you talked about \u2014 there\u2019s this beautiful passage in Darwin which I\u2019ve quoted many times, which is from the very end of The Origin of Species\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026where he says, \u201CThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one, and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.\u201D And you point out so importantly that we can only understand the fullness of that passage when we also look at passages of his where he talks about life in the moment. He says, \u201CWe behold the face of nature bright with gladness. We do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing around us mostly live on insects and seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life.\u201D Mm-hmm. Well, you know, it\u2019s funny \u2014 I think you understand those passages particularly if you understand them as, in effect, letters to Emma, his wife\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026whom he adored, and who was a believer throughout her life. And for me, at least, some of the emotional pressure in those passages only makes sense if you see it as his way of saying to her, I know what you believe, and I honor and love you for believing it. Here\u2019s what I know about the world. Here\u2019s what I know for certain, or near certain, is the way the universe actually operates. And here\u2019s why it shouldn\u2019t be a threat to your feelings, and shouldn\u2019t be a threat to your beliefs. You know, it\u2019s funny because my oldest son, my only son, we called Auden. That\u2019s his middle name. Luke Auden. Yes, I did see that somewhere. Wonderful. After Auden. And had we had a second son, I think we would have given him Darwin\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026as a middle name. So we would have had an Auden and a Darwin in the family. So, if I ask you how your study of Darwin and your reverence for Darwin \u2014 how does it influence your sense of religion? How would you answer that question? Well, it certainly influences my manner of writing, because I always see Darwin as a model of the act of explanation, and of argument \u2014 the morality, the ethics of explanation, maybe. You know, it affects my own \u2014 I don\u2019t want to dignify myself by calling it a religion \u2014 but it affects my own feelings about the universe because I think it\u2019s demonstrative of the possibility that you can be completely committed to a rational, if you like, material explanation of existence, of why \u2014 how we got here, without being committed to a reductive account of our own experience. You can believe that there\u2019s a completely rational account of how we got here, but that you can never fully rationalize what we feel here. That\u2019s central to Darwin\u2019s distinction between the two kinds of time. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s central to Darwin\u2019s vision. And for me, Krista, that\u2019s always been, in many ways, the hardest thing to explain, and the hardest reconciliation to attempt. And I sometimes despair of ever making it adequately. And that is exactly that anybody who, like Darwin, who is committed to science is acutely aware of the limits of scientific explanation. You know, the greatest philosopher of science in the 20th century, Karl Popper, always said that the realm of science was small and distinct, that there was a huge realm of human experience that would never be susceptible to scientific explanation. Now, that didn\u2019t mean that it could be instantly subsumed in the supernatural, but that there were realms of what, for lack of a better word, you can call it spiritual experience, or numinous experience, or irrational experience, or simply the experience of sensibility. All the things that are summed up in Christmas carols, and songs, and poems, and novels, and spirituals, and all the other ways we have of organizing our experience, that those things aren\u2019t contradictory. And again, that\u2019s central to Darwin\u2019s sense of human existence, and I think it\u2019s central to any person\u2019s. You know, here\u2019s something you wrote about Darwin: \u201CDarwin disenchanted believers in heaven, but he re-enchanted lovers of earth. He thought he had found the secret of life, but he knew that nothing could solve the problems of living. That takes all the time we have.\u201D That sums up what I think is exactly right. He really believed, accurately, that he had discovered the secret of life. He had found the reason that species change, but nothing could explain the mysteries of living. And I think that we live in that double experience. Yeah. Which is also the confusion that often brings us to the religious part of life, and the things that religion brings into the world, like community, and ritual, and texts, and teachings. Teachings, and practices and \u2014 I think that that\u2019s one of the things that \u2014 it\u2019s funny, I was just writing about something the other day, Krista, because I\u2019m trying to write a book right now of, sort of, memoirs of coming to New York in the 1980s and what that was all like. And one of the things that occurred to me is that I was in the art world in those years. I was hanging \u2014 getting a degree in art history, God help me, and all that. And the weird thing about it is that, I realized then, that understanding modern art really was like a religion inasmuch as it was a practice before it was a dogma\u2026 Mm-hmm. Yeah. \u2026that you could never really get it by understanding the way one picture had changed another, how Cubism had created Expressionism which created Surrealism, and so on \u2014 that it was a practice of interpretation. And I think that that\u2019s something that is still insufficiently well understood. That what religion brings us is not a dogma, but a practice. That\u2019s the rich thing it brings us. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s the significant thing that it brings us. And that the idea of having a spiritual practice is one that\u2019s completely compatible with the idea of being extremely skeptical of dogma, those two things are not at war. They may be in tension, the way so many rich things in our life are in tension, but they\u2019re not at war. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with The New Yorker\u2019s Adam Gopnik. Einstein used to draw, see echoes \u2014 he would say that a sense of wonder is at the heart of the best of religion and science and the arts. When he used to see those things as \u2014 at their heart, overlapping in that way. Speaking to each other. Absolutely. I think that the \u2014 where science and certain aspects of religiosity do part company is, science demands that we be skeptical even of our own favorite theories. And there\u2019s an aspect, there\u2019s a side of religious tradition that is like that, that demands that we be argumentative about them. I did \u2014 before Yom Kippur this year, I did a talk at one of the local synagogues. I\u2019m not a good enough Jew to be confident that God will be writing my name down in the Book, but I was thinking, you know, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m talking. Right? Doing my bit, God, you know. Don\u2019t be too harsh. And one of the things I was saying is that one of my favorite art historical treasures is the \u2014 what\u2019s called the Darmstadt Haggadah, which is a medieval Jewish illuminated manuscript. There aren\u2019t very many of them. And all it shows is Jews arguing about the text. And that\u2019s very, as you know, a very, very important part of Jewish ways. Moses quarreled with God. I mean, it\u2019s there. Exactly. If there\u2019s something distinct about Jewish interpretive tradition, it\u2019s that it\u2019s an argumentative tradition. Yeah. We argue with God. We argue with each other. We argue with the text. And I think that that\u2019s a really rich way of thinking about the part of faith that really does have a significant overlap with the way we read all kinds of great books, and with the way that we go about understanding the world. You know, you wrote a piece in 2014 that I really loved in The New Yorker, called \u201CBigger Than Phil.\u201D Yes. And in that piece, you reflected on the kind of ironic way we can debate. And I say \u201Cwe,\u201D I also \u2014 I mean, in educated circles about whether God is winning or losing, or religion is in or out \u2014 but you did say that there\u2019s a directly, frankly contemptuous tone about faith that is relatively new in the last 20 years. Yeah. I mean, the so-called \u201Cnew atheists,\u201D with whom I have a great deal of intellectual sympathy\u2026 Yeah. \u2026are more belligerent in their tone. Tone matters a lot. Tone and temperament, I think, matter a great deal. The one thing that was, I found, disturbing about, and to be honest with you about the aftermath of the piece \u2014 which I knew was going to be controversial in the way such things always are \u2014 is I was trying to make the point that anybody of even the most violent, rationalist, always had, within their own practice, their own imagination, their own way of relishing the world, they always had particular idiosyncratic irrationalities. We all do. And I have to say, what I found most gripping in that piece \u2014 the subtler, more enduring point, I think, aside from the battle between the \u201Cnew atheists\u201D and the religious is this idea that \u2014 and this is how you said it \u2014 \u201Cmodern people are drawn to faith while practicing doubt, just as our ancestors professed doubt even as they practiced faith.\u201D Yeah, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s true? Yeah, it\u2019s such an \u2014 but as you say, it\u2019s taking many forms. It\u2019s very fluid. It\u2019s very fluid. It\u2019s not structured as that old established faith could be. Right, and one of the things that\u2019s always, I think, emphasized by, I \u2014 whatever, people of faith, or religious mystics \u2014 is that there can\u2019t be any true faith that isn\u2019t susceptible to enormous sieges of doubt. But I think in our time, those of us who grow up in doubt, who accept scientific skepticism as a foundational part of our world view, also are drawn again and again to kinds of faith, to spiritual practice. My sister, Alison, was drawn at a crisis moment in her life, as she writes about very beautifully in Atlantic Monthly, to the practice of Buddhism, because it seemed to offer spiritual avenues that were essential to her life then. And then found it coming back around again to David Hume and the psychology that she believed in. We talked earlier about how irrationally I\u2019ve been drawn to the music of Christmas my whole life in literature\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and as a way to the assertion of, or of the recognition of, the multitude of experience we have. Well, you know, there\u2019s a lovely passage in the article you wrote, again, where you said, \u201CTrue rationalists are as rare in life as actual deconstructionists are in university English departments, or true bisexuals in gay bars. In a lifetime spent in hotbeds of secularism, I have known perhaps two thorough-going rationalists.\u201D Say some more about that. Well, it comes back to the point I was making that we, as doubters, practice faith as our believing ancestors practiced doubt in their lives. I remember, it was very \u2014 my father, as I said, strongly rejected the religion of his fathers\u2026 Yeah. \u2026the explicit Judaism that he had inherited. Our Jewishness was visible on us through the marks of the eraser, which were stronger than the writing \u2014 act of writing itself. Mm-hmm. And he said to me once, when we were \u2014 when I was growing up, he said \u2014 we were crossing over a river in the car \u2014 \u201CYou know, I always say a prayer when I\u2019m in a big body of water, river, or ocean. I always do.\u201D Right. And that stayed with me. Yeah. And I have my own little meditation practice, you know, every day, I do 20 minutes of breathing and inwardness. And at the end of it, and you\u2019ll forgive me for this embarrassing revelation, but I always, and I never thought about it, but it\u2019s really, like \u2014 I suppose it\u2019s an affinity with my father, I bow at the end of it to the four rivers that have mattered most in my life. Really? Yeah. Mm-hmm. And my children think, appropriately, it\u2019s the most hilarious thing that they\u2019ve ever seen in their life. And they\u2019ll snicker and prod each other at it. And it\u2019s one of those moments when you don\u2019t mind looking ridiculous, when you know you\u2019re looking ridiculous. And you hope that, in the long run, it\u2019ll have some significance for them. And I think that I may be more ridiculous than most of my contemporaries, but I think we all participate in some form or another of that ridiculousness, some form of irrational ritual that\u2019s essential to our existence. And in that sense, I know very, very few thorough-going rationalists. I essentially know none. And I think that\u2019s part of the richness of modern living. And I think that we have a right and a license to make up our practices of the many practices that we\u2019re exposed to and have inherited. Well, what I really appreciate about the way you reflect on this and write about it is that, you know, you do. You talk about the syncretic mixture of rituals that we come up with as modern people. But you do it \u2014 there\u2019s a tenderness to it. I mean, whatever this is that we\u2019re trying to address in ourselves and in human experience, it\u2019s kind of in the nature of the thing that what we\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t completely make sense, and yet it has meaning and you did \u2026 To be mixed up. Yeah. Yeah, the point I was trying to make, Krista, is that all religious experience, as far back as we can take it \u2014 none of it is pure, authentic, unadulterated. Yeah. The Christianity practiced in the year 100 is radically unlike Christian practice now. Christians don\u2019t always like to admit that, but it\u2019s so. Yeah. Same thing is true of Judaism. Same thing is true of all the great religious traditions. They have changed within themselves, have taken on the coloration of their time and temperament, and of the local color, as much as anything can. So, any notion of a one \u2014 of a true, authentic faith always leads us backwards towards fundamentalism. And fundamentalism is a betrayal of the varieties of religious experience. Yeah. Not an assertion of them. So, I think that if you\u2019re a New York City father, when your kids turn 13, one of the things that happens is you go through the Bar Mitzvah year or the Bat Mitzvah year, right? Yeah. And you can\u2019t help but have a little smile on your face as you see the desperate ways in which people try to reconcile a very ancient and complicated religion of Judaism with contemporary, materialist, competitive New York. Right. And it\u2019s often extremely comic, the scale of the invitations, the nature of the celebrations, and so on. But you also recognize that there\u2019s something fundamentally healthy about that. Yeah. That it\u2019s our task as people to find new ways of rearticulating our sense of spiritual practice, our sense of the essential, the necessity of a rational ritual, in ways that are adjusted to their time. And I think that\u2019s\u2026 Yeah. \u2026more beautiful than it is absurd, although it is at times absurd. You did \u2014 you talked about Upper West Side Bar Mitzvahs where 13-year-olds interpret their texts into an acceptable NPR editorial. Yes. But also, you \u2014 there\u2019s this moment, and again, I keep coming back to that piece, \u201CBigger Than Phil,\u201D where you talk about how the hardest rationalists, people who would define themselves that way, still \u201Cthey polish menorahs or decorate Christmas trees, meditate on the great beyond, say a silent prayer, light candles\u2026\u201D You know, at the end, you talk about them going to services and leaving early, but you said, \u201CYou will know them by their faces. They are the weepy ones in the rear.\u201D Yes. Well, that\u2019s self-description, I think\u2026 OK. \u2026as much as anything, you know. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m acutely aware of, you know, when we go off to Christmas Eve services, which we do with a clear conscience, because my wife\u2019s\u2026 Lutheran. \u2026background. Yeah. But in any case, I\u2019m always aware that I am the weepy one in the back\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and unashamed of it. You can listen again and share this conversation with Adam Gopnik through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with the distinctively wise and lyrical New Yorker staff writer, Adam Gopnik. We\u2019re speaking about the ironies of spiritual life in a secular age through the lens of his many fascinations \u2014 from parenting, to the arts, to science. He\u2019s recently written an introduction to a new book, The Good Book, in which novelists, essayists and activists who are not known as religious thinkers reflect on their favorite biblical passages. In this foreword you wrote to this book called The Good Book, even your opening line, \u201CHow shall we sing the Lord\u2019s song in a strange land\u201D \u2014 which is from the Psalms \u2014 \u201Cand how should we read the Bible in a secular age?\u201D There\u2019s something about the way you\u2019ve written it, and I don\u2019t know if this was intentional, where even in the language you use, that it\u2019s kind of an illustration of the fact that the questions and vocabulary of this book, whatever you think of it, continue to have this \u2014 to be appealing and apt in some way. Yeah, I wanted that rhythm. I wanted\u2026 Yeah. \u2026to have the sense of that Jacobean, King James version kind of rhythm, because I thought that was a way into it. One of the things I wanted to say in the introduction to The Good Book was that the question before us isn\u2019t so much, should we continue to read these stories? We do continue to read those stories. It\u2019s not, should we continue to be inspired by the Psalms? We are inspired by the Psalms. We study Italian Renaissance art. It\u2019s part of our common heritage. It\u2019s not a realistic choice to say we will rationalize ourselves out of this side of our inheritance. The question is, how do you approach it? Yeah, how do we do it? How do we do it? There\u2019s also something in there about \u2014 that kind of echoes what we said a minute ago. That for you, and I\u2019m with you on this, that when people think about what\u2019s interesting about religion, the humanity is such \u2014 every bit as fascinating as the divinity, and every bit as central. Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. What\u2019s a special quality or virtue of \u2014 if you like Jewish myth, of Biblical myth? And it\u2019s exactly that it\u2019s people. It\u2019s people. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Unforgettable people\u2026 Real \u2014 and real\u2026 engaged in \u2026 \u2026people so flawed, so well-rounded and incomplete. It\u2019s Job yelling at his God. It\u2019s David and Saul\u2026 Yeah. Right? I mean, is there any more\u2026 Yeah, Jacob. \u2026deeply moving relationship? You recognize the\u2026 Yeah. \u2026the kid who got all the potentiality and the king who knows it and hates him and loves him at the same time. How many relationships does that describe, right? Yeah. All of those things are \u2014 and it carries through, I think, to the Gospels. Yeah. You know, that one of the things that makes Jesus \u2014 I\u2019ve written at length about Jesus \u2014 whether an imaginary character or a well-reported player \u2014 one of the things that makes him so riveting is his enormous impatience with the people around him, right? Yes. And his sort of almost carefree morality. Don\u2019t worry so much about who\u2019s going to take care of you. The flowers don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t you worry so much. You know, be \u2014 feel free. Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter what you take into your mouth, all that matters is what comes out of your mouth. And you can just see everyone around him saying, what did he say? What did he just say? Yeah. And that tough, I think. It\u2019s the ability to create compelling character in the deepest sense. And the thing that makes character character is contradiction. And the Bible is filled with people\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026who have deeply contradictory characters. Including God, by the way. Including God. Above all, God\u2026 Yes. \u2026who\u2019s there as a benevolent shepherd, and is also there as a violent demiurge, who\u2019s there in all of those ways. And that\u2019s one of the things that I say in the introduction. Of all those characters, all those contradictory characters, the character of the divine\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is the most contradictory, and in some ways, therefore, the most compelling. Yeah. So your children, your love for your children, your life with your children, the questions they raise in you, the reflections they spark in you, also runs all the way through your writing. You also wrote in a \u2014 have written in a wonderful way about children and what the philosophers call the problem of consciousness. I mean, I think children also bring us back to philosophical and theological questions in a new way and I\u2019d like to just hear about that. All the time. I\u2019m one of those people for whom the moment when children appeared, was as close to a religious experience as any I hope to have. I was blessed to have it happen twice. Partly because of the miracle of consciousness, you suddenly, kind of \u2014 a fictive being, the baby who will be born, becomes an actual human being. Yeah. And you look into those eyes, and you say those eyes are looking back at me, and that little head in its little woolen cap, contains the world fully as my head contains the world. Yeah. It\u2019s an astonishing thing. You never come to the end of it. But one of the things that\u2019s true, I think, is that you get to the core of human experience through watching your kids. I wrote an essay once called, \u201CDeath of a Fish,\u201D which was\u2026 Yes, I know. I read it. \u2026on the surface \u2014 I always say that good essays have to have an apparent object and a buried subject. Well, the apparent object of this essay was my then-five-year-old daughter, Olivia\u2019s, fish, Bluey, a\u2026 A goldfish that was not actually a goldfish. \u2026a goldfish that was not actually a goldfish and was actually standing in for a dog, which we only got much later \u2014 died. And we decided to go what my wife called the full-Vertigo, in honor of the Hitchcock movie, and replace that bluefish with another bluefish without telling Olivia. Of course, she sensed instantly\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that it was not the same fish. And she was grief-stricken. She was grief-stricken by it. At the same time, my son, Luke, was five years older, and he had become aware of the problem of consciousness. And he kept asking me, \u201CWhat does Bluey feel?\u201D The little fish. \u201CDid he know he was alive, so he can know in some sense that he\u2019s dead? Was he ever aware that he was alive?\u201D Those are deep questions. And what I realized in watching Olivia\u2019s grief over a little fish that was probably never conscious fully in our sense and that was certainly no more conscious than the flounder we ate for dinner, is that the price of human consciousness is the knowledge of mortality. Yeah. That\u2019s exactly the price we pay for it. We have this extraordinary gift of knowing that we are alive, and the price we pay for it is knowing that things die, in ways that almost no other creature does. And I was just overwhelmed by that, sitting up with Olivia one night in this absurd grief for a tiny bluefish, and I realized that that was the equation of human existence. You know, you and I have beloved children who are just about the same age \u2014 young adults now, at the same college. And I\u2019m thinking a lot now about \u2014 you know, you talked about the mystery of this actual human being in front of you, which has loss and celebration all together just so \u2014 back to Auden, back to the Bible. The mystery of the fact that these people you gave birth to and raised are these surprising strangers, that you continue to discover them, and they continue to emerge in ways that you feel you had nothing to do with, that is so remarkable. You never get over it. Yeah. You know, the \u2014 it\u2019s not one person that you love and would give your life for. It\u2019s many people. Yeah. And they continue to come at you in new ways. And the kids are utterly who they always have been\u2026 Yes. \u2026and they\u2019re utterly new. And then this terrible thing happens, Krista. Or it\u2019s not terrible, it\u2019s wonderful. But it\u2019s also kind of terrible. That you say to yourself, I cannot imagine the day when a child will leave home, because my entire life for 20 years has been structured around daily interchanges with this person. That\u2019s basically what I do. I work, I drink caffeine, and I talk to Luke. Those were the three things \u2014 and Olivia, my younger daughter. That\u2019s what my life is about. And then they\u2019re gone. And you\u2019re totally wrenched by that. And then you realize, of course, you did exactly the same thing to your parents. And the interstices of texting and conversations become a little more elongated every day, and you\u2019re pathetically grateful when the phone rings and it\u2019s your kid. And that they actually want to talk to you about something. Usually late at night and they\u2019re moved by a poem, or they\u2019re desperate for some advice or something. And you realize that that\u2019s the strength of your relationship, is exactly that the interstices between phone calls get longer rather than shorter. And that\u2019s what you raised them for, right? We were actually raising them not to be our great children, but to go out in the world and have lives. And not to be our dependents\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and, we hope, not to feel our pain. And, ultimately, we wanted them to have the same relationship to us that we have most often to our own parents, which is one of limitless pity and toleration, right? Right. That\u2019s the most we can ask for. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with the New Yorker\u2019s Adam Gopnik. You were writing about a family reunion and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026I think that was recently. And you used this very evocative phrase I wanted to ask you to draw out: \u201CThe difference between those of us who are growing and those of us who are aging.\u201D And I think what you\u2019ve been talking about is part of that dynamic for you now, but would you say some more about the distinction there? Yes, thank you, Krista. That was a thing I just wrote about three months ago, four months ago. Mm-hmm. We did a big family reunion. I come from this enormous family of six kids, and one of the things that struck me this time when we were there is that pretty much everybody under the age of 35 is still growing. They\u2019re discovering. They\u2019re finding themselves. And you look at them, they look better, and they look more like themselves than they did before. And all of us are on the other side of that \u2014 are aging, right? And we eye each other suspiciously, right? Getting a little tubbier, a little grayer, a little balder, a little flatter. But the good thing about that, I\u2019ve discovered, I would insist, is though it\u2019s true that those of us on this side are merely aging rather than actually growing, with every family reunion \u2014 we have them every 10 years or so \u2014 you realize that the border of youth recedes. And as I said, I think it must be the fourth dimension, because some strange principle is at work there that means that I \u2014 that people our age never really look old, even though we know we\u2019re aging. Yeah. I don\u2019t know what can possibly explain that. But I do think it\u2019s true. And I think graciousness, if not grace, resides in being able to recognize that, again, that same duality, which is not a million miles removed from Darwin\u2019s duality, from the duality of immediate time and long time. Yeah. In this case, it\u2019s maturation versus mortality. The under 35s are approaching the mature point. Yeah. Us mature ones are approaching our mortal point. Yeah. And we have to accept it with as much grace as we can summon up. And it\u2019s not easy. Let\u2019s just circle back a little bit to this spiritual stuff. Which, actually, we have never left. We just have taken a wonderful route through it. I think it feels important to you to \u2014 however we live with this stuff, or talk about it, or just exhibit it around our children, that we don\u2019t make this too easy for ourselves. I mean, you use phrases like \u201Cthe fudginess of faith,\u201D \u201Cthe soupiness of doubt,\u201D \u201Cmushy\u201D all-purpose humanism, which I notice are all kind of bad food texture metaphors. Mm-hmm. As you know, I am a\u2026 Which is also a way \u2026 \u2026food lover. Yeah. I\u2019m a cook. So\u2026 Yeah. So, I think that\u2019s\u2026 \u2026when I\u2019m looking for something\u2026 \u2026significant. \u2026really visceral, it\u2019s always food. Mushy, fudgy, soupy. Just say a little bit about that. Well, I don\u2019t remember the exact context in which I was writing that, but I think\u2026 Oh, these are from different places. I was collecting\u2026 Right. \u2026these bad food texture metaphors. Oh, good. I think that \u2014 I wrote a whole book called, The Table Comes First that was\u2026 Yes. \u2026just devoted to this \u2014 the spiritual side of gluttony. Yeah. One of the things that\u2019s a challenge, I guess, Krista, and maybe I can put it this way, is that those of us who are genuinely of an unashamedly secular and skeptical and scientific turn of mind, but who nonetheless have huge regard for the great realm of experience that, call it what you will, spiritual sensibility \u2014 however we define it \u2014 is we don\u2019t want to just become soupy, synthetic thinkers. We don\u2019t want to just say, oh well, anything goes. If, you know, if you feel good about it, have at it. That\u2019s like bad table discipline. Yeah. OK. But at the same time, we don\u2019t \u2014 we want to say to such people, hey, wait a second. You don\u2019t get an instant out by citing your doubt when there\u2019s something wrong with your faith. You have to be willing to own up to the contradictions in your own creed. And I think that that\u2019s what I was referencing in those sections, I think\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is that we have to sort of toughen up our own belief. There are, in life \u2014 there are simply incommensurable beliefs. It would be nice for people of a basically conciliatory turn of mind to believe that we can always reconcile all the varieties of faith, of religious experience, of scientific understanding, and we can\u2019t. We can\u2019t. Yeah. That\u2019s not one of the possibilities that\u2019s open to us, and we have to be tough-minded and clear-headed about that. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t practice tolerance in the longest and largest possible mode, but we can\u2019t pretend that we all ultimately believe the same thing. We don\u2019t all ultimately believe the\u2026 Yeah. And actually\u2026 \u2026believe the same thing. \u2026that\u2019s where I think your emphasis on tone is helpful, because you have a \u2014 you have a skepticism \u2014 not a skepticism, you see a tension in tolerance, which I really \u2014 I\u2019m with you on that. You know, we don\u2019t want a world without passion, and we don\u2019t want a world without conviction. And that there\u2019s kind of a creative tension in insisting on tolerance, and it\u2019s kind of how we do it, and how we keep that integrity. One of the great things about modern civilization, one of the great things, if I may say, about liberal civilization, and I am a liberal before all else. Liberal, for me, is a positive, constructive, aggressive term, because it refers to a very radical and revolutionary set of beliefs. And among those beliefs is the belief that you can have genuine disagreement, passionate, profound disagreement, and still incorporate those kinds of passion, profound disagreements into a broad \u2014 in broad\u2026 Yeah. Right. \u2026fabric of tolerance. That being tolerant doesn\u2019t mean being wishy-washy or limp, and saying, oh well, you know, they \u2014 everybody\u2019s got their point of view, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a fundamentalist or a secularist \u2026 Right. That\u2019s where you don\u2019t want tolerance be mushy, fudgy, or soupy, either. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Tolerance isn\u2019t a soupy doctrine, it\u2019s a plate-by-plate doctrine. Right. It says, you know, there\u2019s a place for you at the table, but you have a different diet than we do. Yeah. And that\u2019s \u2014 that, I think, is \u2014 that kind of clarity, I think, is terribly important, and it\u2019s that kind of clarity that I would oppose to fudgy soupiness\u2026 Yeah. \u2026which pretends that there aren\u2019t real and vital distinctions to be made amongst what people believe, that we can\u2019t simply constantly assimilate radically different world views to one common, goopy substance. That doesn\u2019t mean, though, that we can\u2019t stretch the fabric of tolerance, if you like, the table of tolerance, and make it as long as we possibly can. Wonderful. I think I want to read just another couple more beautiful sentences from this foreword you wrote to The Good Bookon the subject of morality, you know, which\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026is a subject that gets very fraught when we talk about it in public. You said, \u201CNo moral idea worth preserving has been lost as the idea of God has diminished.\u201D But then a few sentences later, you also say, \u201CThe paradox in our history has been that the renewal of humanism has come about most often, and the most arresting questions asked of it, by reexamining the old stories and asking them new questions.\u201D Yeah, well, what I tried to say in that section is that \u2014 there are many ways, many heroic ethical systems that are built on the foundation of non-belief. Yeah. That\u2019s the way John Stuart Mill builds his ethics, and many other great thinkers. So, we don\u2019t necessarily lose anything. But at the same time \u2014 this is a point that I think you can never make enough \u2014 atheism, non-belief, may be a fact about the world, but humanism, humanism is a thing we invent. It\u2019s a thing we make. It\u2019s a set of values we make. So just as the assertion of God doesn\u2019t give you a value system, the denial of God does not give you a value system, either. Mm-hmm. Those systems are things we have to make for ourselves. And we make them, as we\u2019ve been talking all this time, usually by addressing the old ones. We\u2019re not capable of making everything up for ourselves. So we go back to ethical systems and value systems that we\u2019ve inherited, whether it\u2019s my sister\u2019s version of Buddhism, my own version of nativity, faith, whatever it might be, we go back to them. And we remake them. We interrogate them. We remake them to find values within them that give meaning to our lives and sense to our \u201Cgenerations\u201D in the Biblical sense. We may be ultimately in the universe on our own. But we are not on Earth newly born. We descend from long lines of people who\u2019ve asked similar questions. You can hold those two convictions simultaneously and passionately. Wonderful. You just \u2014 just ask you this in closing. You know, we talked a minute ago about the difference between those of us who are growing and those of us who are aging, and I think you, like me, even though we\u2019re very young and vital, still feel like we\u2019re on that \u2014 we are aging and it\u2019s a fascinating thing. Was there anything about when you were asked to write this chapter about the Bible, here in the year 2015, was there anything in what came up in you that surprised you? That was maybe an approach you have to this that wouldn\u2019t have been there in your 20s or your 40s that you were aware of? Oh, gosh. That\u2019s a big question, and I have to think for a moment. As I\u2019ve stopped growing and started aging, I think that you become \u2014 this is hardly an original insight of mine \u2014 you become acutely aware of the rapidity of the passage of time. I\u2019m acutely aware that when writing about the 1980s now, which seem like yesterday to me, I\u2019m writing about a lost historical period, a time that\u2019s as remote for my kids, as the 1940s were for me growing up. And I think that you become \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can put this well, Krista \u2014 you become more concerned with describing the texture of experience before it can vanish than you do with shaping the necessities of experience for your own time. How that affects the way you would approach writing about reading the Bible is maybe complicated. But if there\u2019s a connection there, I think that it\u2019s a way of saying, look, here\u2019s the truth. People have been reading these books, and looking at the pictures this book inspires, and listening to the music that this book inspires for about as long as there have been people. That truth is in itself a truth. Whatever you make of all the attendant religious, supernatural claims around it, the truth about human engagement with, in this case, with scripture, is in itself a significant thing. And it\u2019s not \u2014 that perception, maybe, Krista, isn\u2019t completed divorced from your perception that time is racing, and trying to witness your own experience is about as close as you can get. Witness your own experience accurately and fully and passionately is about as close as you can hope to get to writing another chapter in the ongoing book. This is some language from that Good Book foreword: \u201CThe fugue of doubt and faith experienced as argument and art is the music of our lives.\u201D That put it\u2019s much more epigrammatically what I was struggling to say. That\u2019s quite a beautiful way to say what you\u2019re saying. That puts more \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m a writer, not a speaker, because that puts much more aphoristically what I\u2019ve been struggling to say in the last few minutes. Oh. John Updike was once asked why \u2014 for an ad, I think, like a whiskey ad or some crazy thing \u2014 why are we here? Why do we live? Sounds like a ridiculous question, but he had an instant answer for it. He said, \u201CWe\u2019re here to give praise.\u201D We\u2019re here to give praise. Mm-hmm. All of our religious teaching and all of our spiritual experience can be summed up in that conception where we\u2019re on earth to give praise. And I love that idea. And of course, one of the things that makes Updike\u2019s writing so moving, even now, is that it largely was devoted to \u2014 did not scant the horrors of existence. But it was largely devoted to recapturing the momentary happinesses of ordinary experience. And his spirituality was, in effect, boded forth in terms of recreating, crystallizing the ecstatic moments in life. And if I have a faith, it lies some place in that impulse.
