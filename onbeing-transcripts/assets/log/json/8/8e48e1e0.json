  "fullText": "This hour, for Christmas week, an exuberant experience of conversation and singing the spirituals. The Negro spiritual was born in slavery, but it claims a place at the heart of American musical, religious, and cultural life. The late Joe Carter embodied the universal appeal and hidden historical meanings in this music. We sat down in a recording studio in 2003. This was one of our first weekly shows and still one of our and our listeners\u2019 most beloved. From American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today on Being, \u201CJoe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual.\u201D Swing low, sweet chariot, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Swing low \u2026 The spiritual is the source from which gospel, jazz, blues, and hip-hop evolved. The organizing concept of this music is not the melody of Europe, but the rhythm of Africa. And it also conveys a theology, a potent mix of African spirituality, Hebrew narrative, Christian doctrine, and an extreme experience of human suffering. Joe Carter performed for more than 25 years in opera and musical theater, and he sang the folk music of many cultures. He portrayed Paul Robeson in a one-man musical and traveled to Africa and Siberia as a performer and goodwill ambassador. And he introduced thousands of people around the world to the spiritual. In the immediate generations after American slavery ended, this music was almost forgotten. By the 1950s and 1960s when Joe Carter was growing up, many African-Americans only vaguely knew of it. Joe Carter\u2019s great-grandparents had been slaves. But his Cambridge, Massachusetts, parents were eager that he not build his life on stories of the suffering of his ancestors. At the main black church in Cambridge, which they attended, traditional European church music was sung. But occasionally, the family listened at home to a haunting old recording of a renowned Ohio radio choir, \u201CWings Over Jordan.\u201D The civil rights movement rediscovered the spiritual and put it on the larger American cultural map. When Joe Carter was 15, he formed a folk duo with a Jewish friend. And through him, Joe began to recover the spiritual music of his own people. David told me, \u201CJoe, your people have wonderful music.\u201D And this was the first time I\u2019d ever heard someone say that. And so he wanted to come to my church to hear the music. So he came to Union Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and heard Bach. He said, \u201CJoe, that ain\u2019t it.\u201D From then on, Joe Carter began, as he would say, to search for the spiritual. I wanted to hear what he\u2019s learned about the meaning of this music and its power across time and cultures. There are an estimated 5,000 spirituals in existence. They were originally called \u201Csorrow songs.\u201D And many of them were composed spontaneously. As a teenager, I met a woman by the name of Jessie Anthony who was, I think she was over 80 when I met her. And somehow, she was coming to our church. And we young people would go to her house to collect her, to bring her to church and so on. Well, here was an African-American woman whose parents were slaves in Virginia. And she sang the spirituals. And she\u2019d heard me sing in church, so she just sort of took me under her wing. And she was going to teach me these songs. And she had a suitcase full of stories that she\u2019d collected over the years of the spirituals. And she would tell me, she\u2019d say, \u201CChild, when they sang this song, this is what they were talking about, you know? A lot of people don\u2019t know this.\u201D And she had stories for every song. Oh. OK, tell me a story. One of the stories I seem to remember that she told, it was about \u2014 Emancipation Day had come. And there was a group of former slaves now on an island off the coast of South Carolina. And my parents were from South Carolina, all my family. And they were waiting for the emissary of the government to arrive in his little boat to tell them that they had received the deeds to their land, because the government had promised them not only freedom, but 40 acres and a mule. And so this was going to be a great, wonderful day. And the former slaves had gathered together on the island waiting with bated breath. And finally, they saw the boat of the officer approaching. And they could tell, even from the distance, that his face was not happy and his countenance was somewhat sad. And they said there was a groan that just came from the crowd. And one of the older women from the crowd just stood up and began to make up a song on the spot. She sang, \u201CNobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Nobody knows but Jesus. Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.\u201D And then she spoke, looking to the people around her, she said, \u201CSometimes I\u2019m up, sometimes I\u2019m down. Oh, yes, Lord. Sometimes, I\u2019m almost level to the ground. Oh, yes, Lord. Oh, nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Nobody knows but Jesus. Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.\u201D She looked at the people standing by, and she said, \u201CAlthough you see me going along so.\u201D And they answered, [singing] \u201COh, yes, Lord.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve got my trials here below.\u201D And they answered, [singing] \u201COh, yes, Lord. Oh, nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Nobody knows but Jesus. Nobody knows the trouble I\u2019ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.\u201D And sorrow songs, is that what the spirituals were called \u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m told. \u2026 routinely? And it does connote, it connotes what\u2019s in the music, but it connotes something different from the title \u201Cspiritual.\u201D Mm-hmm. Because they were the expression of the great pain and the sorrow. But at the same time, they were always looking upward. They were always reaching. There was always some level of hope, as opposed to the concept of the blues. The blues was just singing about your troubles, and there was no hope. But there\u2019s always the glory hallelujah someplace saying, \u201COh, and on that glory hallelujah, then we fly.\u201D Right. So in the midst of the night, we can fly away to freedom while we\u2019re singing these, these songs. I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow Down in this wide world alone No hope have I for tomorrow I\u2019ve started to make heaven my home. Sometimes I\u2019m tossed and driven, Lord Sometimes I don\u2019t know where to roam I\u2019ve heard of a city called heaven I\u2019ve started to make heaven my home The late musician and teacher Joe Carter. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, on Being\u2014 conversation about religion and ethics, ideas and meaning. Today, exploring the African-American spiritual. The body of music, we know as the spiritual, emerged from bitter experience, yet it conveyed a generous understanding of the nature of God and of human life. I think that the sorrow became the entrance, the open door, into a whole new world of experience. They, the slaves, could not experience the normal world. They couldn\u2019t go out and go shopping. They couldn\u2019t buy a house. They couldn\u2019t do all the things that the normal white person did. They were slaves, you know? They were whipped and they had chains. And they found a secret door to take them into that world where the tears are wiped away. But the tears are cried first, aren\u2019t they? Yeah. You know, you talked about the secret power of these songs. And I think so much of what we\u2019re learning now in our advanced day is how important it is to embrace suffering in life in order to move forward. Yeah. And maybe they did not have a choice. No, they didn\u2019t. But there\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s healing in that moment, even though it doesn\u2019t take the pain away, you know? And that\u2019s one reason, I think, that African-American religion and culture has become so powerful in the world. One of the things that I think about when I think about this body of music, I realize that it was the foundation for most other American music, you know? Right. And, and this music has changed the face of music in the 20th century. And the story behind the creation of the spiritual, it\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s a miraculous story. Normally, when you hear the story of African-American music in a documentary or something, you go back to Ella Fitzgerald or Louie Armstrong. Yeah. And I say, well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s great. But you \u2014 if you really want to know the story behind the story, find out who Louie\u2019s grandmother was and what she was singing. What were the songs he learned when he was a baby? And what, what were the messages of those songs? And the thing that we find is that in the midst of all of the most horrible pain, some of these powerful individuals lived transcendent, shining lives. They were able to rise up above. I mean, they were able to be loving and forgiving in the midst of it all. Mammy was taking care of master\u2019s baby. It was mammy, not master\u2019s wife, that was nursing that little baby. Mammy could have poisoned the child. She could have smothered the child. But she loved that child like it was her own child. Because there was something in her faith that said, \u201CYou\u2019re supposed to be loving. You\u2019re supposed to be kind. You\u2019re supposed to be forgiving. And there\u2019s no excuse if you are not.\u201D We have songs like \u2014 the interesting thing, you don\u2019t find mean-spirited sentiments in the spirituals. Right. They\u2019re the most noble sentiments. Now, you \u2014 find a song like this: \u201CIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s me, oh, Lord, standing in the need of prayer.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s me, oh, Lord, standing in the need of prayer, not my brother, not my sister.\u201D Yeah. Not the preacher, not the deacon, not the doctor, not the lawyer. Not the master? Wait a minute. These are people who were victims. They were in the midst of the most horrible situation but they said, \u201CI\u2019m taking responsibility for who I am today, and it\u2019s me standing in the need. I\u2019m the one that has the proud heart today. Come and fix me.\u201D This is not only sound theology and psychology, it\u2019s extremely mature spirituality, right? Yeah. What was it that, that came together in the lives and the spiritual sensibility of those slaves that, that connected them so powerfully to \u2014 really those are the best attributes of Christianity that you\u2019re talking about. Mm-hmm. They\u2019re not often practiced. You know, James Weldon Johnson talked about this as, you know, the verging of the spirit of Christianity with the vestiges of African music or an African sensibility. Mm-hmm. I mean, do you have any ideas about what made that such a special fusion? Well, I\u2019ve thought about it a lot. Yeah. And, and one thing that occurs to me, if we go back to the cultures of the slaves that came from many different African nations and languages, but one thing they had in common was they believed in a supreme deity. But they believed he was very busy and very, very holy, and in order to get to him, you had to go through the ancestors. It wasn\u2019t very dissimilar to the way Europeans felt with the saints, and so on. When slavery took place \u2014 and there was also this, this concept that you commune with deity with magic, shining songs. If your songs come forth with great fervor, you not only reach deity, but deity comes and possesses you, becomes part of you, and gives you the strength to do whatever you\u2019ve got to do to win your battles, to harvest your crop. And when people were taken suddenly as slaves, when they were literally kidnapped from their normal lives, whatever those lives were, they were taken away from the land of their ancestors. The spirit of the ancestors couldn\u2019t cross the water. And so, when they were taken on these boats away from their homes, they experienced the most deep desolation possible, because not only were they being removed from their friends and kindred, but they were being removed from their God. And they had no way to get to God, because the ancestors were way back in Africa on the land. And I imagine when the slaves heard about this Jesus \u2014 now, the master\u2019s religion \u2014 first of all, you got to realize this, they were not impressed by the master\u2019s Christianity, may I say. Well, right. I mean, this is why it\u2019s even surprising to me that they adopted Christianity. Yeah. Exactly, because they saw all of the brutality, they saw all the hypocrisy and were the brunt of it. But they heard about this Jesus, this man of sorrow who suffered, and they identified. They thought \u2014 and then they were told that Jesus is the Son of the High God. \u201CNo. Wait, the Son of the High God? We can get to the High God through this guy?\u201D Right. \u201CAnd His story sounds like our story. He\u2019s born in terrible circumstances, He\u2019s mistreated. He\u2019s finally abused and killed. My goodness. Maybe He will carry us to the High God.\u201D Then also, they heard stories about Daniel and the lion\u2019s den. Yeah. My goodness. They loved that story because they identified with Daniel. Tell the story, and tell me what the connection is between those people and that story. Well, let me, let me sing the song that they, they created from the story. Yeah. OK. OK. Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, why not everyone? Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, why not everyone? He delivered Daniel from the lion\u2019s den Jonah from the belly of the whale The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace Why not everyone? Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, why not everyone? The moon runs down in a purple stream The sun refuse to shine Every star shall disappear But Jesus shall be mine. Oh, didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel Didn\u2019t my Lord deliver Daniel, why not everyone Why not everyone? Why not everyone? They were in the lion\u2019s den of slavery, and that lion was roaring around them every day. But somehow the hope that came from this story that the angels locked the lion\u2019s jaws, I mean, they loved that story. Joe Carter never made CD recordings of these songs in his lifetime.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today on Being, in word and song, we\u2019re exploring the musical genre the African-American spiritual. I sat down with the late humanitarian and performer Joe Carter in 2003. Modern Americans sometimes confuse the spiritual with gospel, but Joe Carter was always quick to point out the difference. Gospel songs, he said, are focused on a joyous message. They have a faster beat and are attributed to identifiable authors. African-American spirituals, some 5,000 songs, were written anonymously by slaves. Each song typically expresses a single sentiment or message, often born of grief. The great Harlem writer James Weldon Johnson published his first collection of American Negro spirituals in 1925, but it remained for the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the phenomenon of black pride to bring these songs to a wide audience. Joe Carter studied the spirituals and performed them all over the world. A great-grandson of slaves, he thought deeply about the enduring spiritual power of these songs across many cultures. He was also fascinated by how slaves used the spirituals within their given reality as a kind of code. An old master comes out one day. He says, \u201CHey, Joe. Big Joe. I don\u2019t hear nobody singing down there. You guys strike me up one of them good old spiritual songs. You know how I like them. Give me one of them good old songs.\u201D And \u2014 often when I go to the schoolchildren, I have them sing with me. I say, \u201COK. Now pretend you\u2019re going to be \u2014 you\u2019re all slaves, OK? And, and master wants us to sing a song, but you \u2014 we don\u2019t really want to sing for master, do we?\u201D \u201CNo. No, we don\u2019t.\u201D I say, \u201CWell, I\u2019ll tell you something. Master loves our singing, but he doesn\u2019t listen to the words we say. He doesn\u2019t have a clue what we\u2019re \u2014 so we can say anything we want. So, let\u2019s give the master a good old song.\u201D What do you sing with the kids? \u201CWhen Israel was in Egypt land, let my people go! Oppressed so hard they could not stand, let my people go! Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt\u2019s land and tell old pharaoh, \u2018Let my people go!'\u201D And after we go through the song, they go, \u201CHey, old master, how was that one?\u201D One of the connections also that I learned about that period of time from my grandparents was my grandfather was a storyteller. And he would regale the family, every time we were together, with slavery stories. I mean, that\u2019s what he always talked about. And there was a slave by the name of John who was the star of all of these stories. Right. And you never knew whether the story was true or not, but it was always funny and it got your attention, and Grandpa was a good storyteller. But there was also always a moral at the end of the story. But the one theme that went through all of these stories was the end of the story, was that John had outsmarted the master. He was always ahead of the master. So, there was this concept: The master doesn\u2019t really understand us. We play a role for him and he sees us in a certain way, and we\u2019ll play that role as much as we can so that we won\u2019t get whipped. So, we\u2019ve got to understand his thinking, but he can never understand our thinking. And so, the spirituals were all, all of the spirituals, all of the songs were masks \u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026 as well as, you know, these transcendent wonderful moments. They were also signals for escape. This was one of my grandmother\u2019s favorite songs. Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus I\u2019ve got to steal away, steal away home I ain\u2019t got long to stay here Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus I\u2019ve got to steal away, steal away home I ain\u2019t got long to stay here My Lord He calls me, He calls me by the thunder The trumpet sounds within my soul I ain\u2019t got long to stay here Green trees are bending, poor sinner stands atremblin\u2019 The trumpet sounds within my soul And I ain\u2019t, I ain\u2019t got long to stay, to stay here You know, it\u2019s a religious idea that there is a better life after this one, right? It\u2019s a piece of doctrine. But there is something so miraculous happening when you are listening to this music or singing it. You know, for that moment, you\u2019re actually transported to that better life, right? Yeah. I mean, you\u2019re singing, \u201CSoon I will be done,\u201D but I think in singing that song, you can go through another day of this misery. Exactly. Right? It makes you strong for a little while. It\u2019s almost like the eternal becomes part of the present. It\u2019s amazing. I think that\u2019s it. I think that is it. It\u2019s like you, you get into the stream of that living water. Yeah. And there\u2019s no past, present, and future. It\u2019s just right now, and right now everything is all right. Yeah. You know, there\u2019s a story about Elijah, I think, and a woman whose son died. And she had received this son in a special \u2014 as a miracle, actually. And the prophet told her that she was going to have this son at a certain time and she did, and the son dies. And she says, \u201CSend for the man of God. Send for that prophet.\u201D And Elijah sends a servant. She says, \u201CNo, no, no. I want to see the man. Now, you gave me the promise, I have a child, and my child has died. I\u2019m having a tragedy right now.\u201D And when Elijah rode, coming close to her, he said, \u201CWoman, how is it with thee?\u201D She said, \u201CIt is well with my soul.\u201D And there was something that you can find even today in those, especially the older people who really have faith, you say, \u201CHow are you doing?\u201D And you just see that smile. And it doesn\u2019t say that \u201CI\u2019m doing OK.\u201D It doesn\u2019t say that \u201Ceverything\u2019s OK in my life.\u201D Sometimes they\u2019ll say, \u201CI\u2019m blessed.\u201D Sometimes they\u2019ll say, \u201CIt is well,\u201D you know? So the sense of well-being does not depend on whether things are good or bad or up or down because, if we had to live that way as slaves, we would constantly be buried underneath the ground, because the circumstances were so horrible and so bad we had to find, as I say, that secret door. We talked about how there was this subversive power of the words of the spirituals, saying things which really contradicted the, the interests of the masters, for example. But also I think there were more overt codes and real practical references in some of the spirituals. And give me an example of that, where there was almost a secret language. \u201CSteal Away to Jesus.\u201D Yeah. And, and when someone said, \u201CI ain\u2019t got long to stay,\u201Deverybody knew, \u201CHey, I\u2019m going to be escaping tonight, and I want you to be supporting me.\u201D Wow. \u201CSomeone is going to meet us on the other side of the river. Green trees are bending, poor sinner stands atrembling.\u201D And maybe they had a signal where someone would shake a leaf and a branch of a tree across the river and you\u2019d go on to safety to the Underground Railroad, hopefully. \u201CSwing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.\u201D \u201CSwing Low, Sweet Chariot.\u201D What\u2019s, what\u2019s going on there that\u2019s not overt? Well, first, \u201CSwing Low, Sweet Chariot\u201D was a death song. Right. As most of them were in some way. Yeah. And it was often sung when a child died. And it was a way to evoke one\u2019s dignity to say, \u201CEven though I\u2019m a slave, God has to send a golden chariot down from the sky, I\u2019m going to have dignity. My child\u2019s going to have dignity. I looked over Jordan and what did I see? A band of angels coming after me, coming for to carry me home.\u201D But then later you get, \u201CIf you get there before I do, tell all my friends I\u2019m coming up there too.\u201D And so the master never knew what they were singing about. You see? I did not know that. Yeah. And so I think at some point someone realized, \u201CMaybe I don\u2019t have to die in order to have a little heaven.\u201D Right. Freedom. And, of course, they thought that if they got to the Mason-Dixon Line and crossed, they would have true freedom. And then, unfortunately, they got across the Mason-Dixon Line, still found there was oppression and found that somehow they had to revert back to the original spiritual meanings of the songs because the political meanings never delivered them. Swing low, sweet chariot, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Swing low, sweet chariot, I said it\u2019s comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Well, I looked over Jordan and what did I see, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Well it was a band of angels comin\u2019 after me, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Why don\u2019t you swing low, sweet chariot, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Oh, swing low, sweet chariot, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. If you get there before I do, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Tell all my friends I\u2019m comin\u2019 up there too, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Why don\u2019t you swing low, sweet chariot, comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Oh, swing low, sweet chariot, oh, it\u2019s comin\u2019 for to carry me home. It\u2019s comin\u2019 for to carry me home. Oh, it\u2019s comin\u2019 for to carry me home. And I think there were so many of the songs, even \u201CWade in the Water\u201D \u2014 \u201CGod\u2019s going to trouble the water\u201D \u2014 another image of people going to the river to be baptized and also going to the river to escape to freedom. And when someone started that song and started moving through the woods, the story of \u201CWade in the Water.\u201D They loved that story. And the story was that a certain season the angels would come and trouble the water, as they say, which, I don\u2019t know, they put their wings in or their toenails or whatever. But whatever happened, once they touched the waters, if you got in the water and you were sick, you\u2019d be healed. And so here\u2019s this guy, 38 years he\u2019s been going. And Jesus comes by and says, \u2018What\u2019s your problem?\u2019 He says, \u2018Can\u2019t you see? I\u2019m a lame man. And every time the angels come to trouble the water, somebody gets in before me.\u2019 And Jesus said, \u2018Do you want to be healed?\u2019 \u2018Well, yes. Of course, I do.\u2019 \u2018Then take up your bed and walk.\u2019 They loved this story, because this was about self-sufficiency. We are not victims. We\u2019re powerful individuals, and we are a people of faith. And so they sang \u2014 let me just do a little bit of that song. Yeah. Wade in the water, wade in the water, children Wade in the water, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water Who\u2019s that yonder dressed in white, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water Well, it must be the people called the Israelites, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water Children, wade in the water, wade in the water, children Wade in the water, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water. Well who\u2019s that yonder dressed in red, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water It must be the people that Moses led, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water Children, wade in the water, wade in the water, children Wade in the water, God\u2019s gonna trouble the water God\u2019s gonna trouble the water Well, God\u2019s gonna trouble, gonna trouble the water What this makes me think of is how the politics of freedom can actually distract from this inner freedom and dignity, which the slaves possessed and which we find so expressed in this music even today. And maybe in the same sense that sometimes religion can distract from spirituality. You get a structure, a form. You get a structure, right. You get a program, and somehow, after a while, the real thing is as elusive as is the Holy Grail. Right. You can lose this sense that these slaves who created this music obviously had that \u2014 at every moment, they were full of grace. They were blessed, right? All was well with their souls no matter what was going on around them, no matter what rights they had or what their legal status was. Now, it must be said that there were certainly slaves who were trying to escape, slaves who were willing to get involved in revolution and insurrection and so on. But I think the larger community had a spiritual identity that guided them. And we have to be so careful not to be glorifying slavery, right? Or \u2026 That\u2019s, yeah. Or glorifying, so what are we talking about here? What are we getting at? You know, I think what we\u2019re talking about human suffering and how do we survive when the worst happens? What are the mechanisms? And I think that African-Americans have shown the world, and other peoples have done it, too. Other peoples are doing it all the time, and it\u2019s the same process. It doesn\u2019t matter who the people are. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the song is an actual song of notes and music or whether it\u2019s the spirit of a people expressed in some other way, but you\u2019ll find, for example, when I sing these songs, I can sing \u201CMotherless Child\u201D in Siberia; they know what it means. They\u2019ve been through hell. I can go to Scotland and Ireland and Wales and sing these. They understand the sentiment. As a matter of fact, you go to Wales right now, you\u2019ll find African-American spirituals in Welsh in the Welsh hymnbook, part of their worship, you know? So the songs have become symbolic, I think, of that universal quest for freedom, that yearning for freedom and that part of us that says, \u201CI will not be defeated.\u201D Ms. Tippett: The late Joe Carter. I\u2019m Krista Tippett on Being, conversation about meaning and faith, ethics and ideas. Today, exploring the African-American spiritual. The paradox of the spirituals in their context of slavery was that they gave themselves over in some sense to, to suffering and to the hardness of life and to \u2014 really to an essential powerlessness. You know, this, this is where we are. This is where we live. And \u2014 but there was an \u201Cand.\u201D \u201CAnd I am beloved, I\u2019m graced, I am blessed, I have dignity, I\u2019m alive and what I experience now is not all there is.\u201D You know, there\u2019s, there\u2019s a surrender and there\u2019s an incredible power at the same time in the spirituals \u2014 and I don\u2019t know, when life is sort of halfway better, maybe the surrender goes away and the power is diminished, too. Does that \u2014 am I making any sense? Yeah. I, I think it\u2019s \u2026 And what is \u2026 \u2026 you know, that\u2019s one of the horrible problems that we have to deal with, with the whole issue of progress, you know? Right. Because in the process, we may lose something. But you know something? Because I have been living with these songs, these songs have become the strength of my life. Because I realize even though I am not in slavery, as my grandparents or great-grandparents were, I deal with all of the difficulties of life that \u2014 nobody escapes. No. And even somebody who\u2019s perfectly free and perfectly rich and perfectly powerful in the world\u2019s terms doesn\u2019t escape from suffering, right? That\u2019s right. OK. And bondage \u2014 the worst kind of bondage is that which takes place in the inside, you know. And when we look back to the slavery days, we were bound, but it was the master who was really the slave. And I think some of us understand that now. But I experience in my own life great strength from telling the stories and looking back, because I see what they went through, and I haven\u2019t experienced anything like what my ancestors did. And I complain about everything, you know? I wonder if it is at all disturbing to you that this music with its sensibility has, you know, is considered now to be a defining part of American culture as a whole? You could say maybe that it\u2019s been co-opted, embraced. Does that, does that bother you because that necessarily takes it out of its context, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, is it OK for a white person to celebrate this as much as \u2026 Well, I think it\u2019s a good question. And \u2014 and my answer is this, when any music or art becomes this transcendent thing that helps people through, it then becomes a property of the universe. It becomes a property of the world. And to tell the story of the spiritual, it\u2019s not an African story. It is an African-American story. It\u2019s the blending of the two cultures. And the fact that George Gershwin was influenced greatly by the spirituals, you know, I think it\u2019s a wonderful thing that this man could reach out of his neighborhood, go down to South Carolina and listen to the elders sing and come back and say, \u201CThis is a treasure.\u201D And then translate that through his genius and give to the world as so many others have. And I mean, even \u2014 there are many European composers like Dvor\u2021k who were influenced by this music. And today, I think \u2014 it\u2019s true with any kind of art, there has to be the sensitivity of the person who is observing and participating. Some people don\u2019t get it no matter what you do. And there are other people, you don\u2019t have to say anything, they get it from the get-go, you know? Yeah. One of the things I would say about the development of African-American music and culture, the powers that be found it much more attractive to promote the blues \u2014 and to promote the image of the black man singing the blues with a bottle of wine in his back pocket, singing about less-than-noble sentiments while we had this whole treasure. And the Paul Robesons and the Marian Andersons and others who came and brought this music forth, they didn\u2019t make the big commercial successes. Well, Robeson, and Anderson did for a while, but they\u2019re among the few. In order to make a commercial success, you\u2019ve got to sing soul, you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got to get away from anything that is spiritual. And change the message. Soul as opposed to spiritual. Yeah. That\u2019s interesting. We have still have a problem, because there are still people who don\u2019t want to tell the truth about who we are. And if the truth is really told, then you\u2019ve got to go back and tell the story of the love and the forgiveness and the power of many of the ancestors. They weren\u2019t all loving and forgiving. I mean, some of them were mean-spirited. Some of them, you know, did whatever they had to do, I\u2019m sure. But as a, a national identity, this music became the embodiment of a spirit of goodwill, a spirit of forgiveness, a spirit of \u201CI\u2019m going to survive no matter what.\u201D Dignity. I mean, that\u2019s the word that keeps coming up. And that\u2019s \u2014 yeah, yeah, yeah. And by the way, this woman that I told you about, Jessie Anthony, she was the most dignified soul I\u2019d ever met. The last time I saw her, she was, I think, 88 years old. Her parents were born slaves. And she began to sing the spirituals. She began \u2014 she sang at Boston Public Library, she sang at Harvard, demonstrating the music. And she said, \u201CJoe?\u201D I said, \u201CYes, Ms. Anthony.\u201D She said, \u201CI want you to go into my bedroom and look under my bed and tell me what you see there.\u201D And so I went into her bed. I said, \u201CYou got a suitcase.\u201D She said, \u201CYes, I do, child.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat\u2019s in the suitcase?\u201D And she smiled. She beamed at me. She said, \u201CIn that suitcase, I\u2019ve got my going-home clothes. Ooh, I\u2019ve got a beautiful dress in there. Jesus is coming for me any day, don\u2019t you know, child?\u201D And she just started laughing. I\u2019ll never forget that image. Here was someone who\u2019d gone through all of the changes in culture and society, and now was living in an elder apartment complex in Boston, all of her children in Washington, D.C., and everything. And she was still singing her songs. And she was holding her head up high every place she went. You know, she was the kind of person who just commanded your respect. And when the young people \u2014 whenever we\u2019d go to her house, she would us the stories, all these songs and everything. And then, she would always end singing one little song. Give me a C, Tom. And she\u2019d sing, \u201CChildren, if you don\u2019t remember anything I\u2019ve told you, if you don\u2019t remember any songs that I\u2019ve sung for you, I want you to remember this one.\u201D Be ready when he comes Be ready when he comes Be ready when he comes Oh, Lord, he\u2019s coming again so soon Be ready when he comes Be ready when he comes Be ready when he comes Oh, Lord, he\u2019s coming again so soon \u201CNow, Joe, you be ready.\u201D You know, \u201CYou be ready, child.\u201D Joe Carter was a teacher, performer, and traveling humanitarian. He died at the age of 57 of leukemia on June 26th, 2006. When my father died and I just \u2014 I got the news I was here. And I remember that morning, I had turned on public radio and there was just a little piece of a spiritual that came through, and it\u2019s something that I had heard as a child. You know, later, when I, I did my concerts, I would do a tribute to my father at the end of the concert, I would sing this song. Let the work that I\u2019ve done speak for me Let the work that I\u2019ve done speak for me When I come to the end of this road And I lay down this old heavy load Let the work that I\u2019ve done speak for me Let the life that I\u2019ve lived speak for me Let the life that I\u2019ve lived, Lord, speak for me When I come to the end of this road And I lay down this heavy load Let the life that I\u2019ve lived, oh, Lord, speak for me Our website, onbeing.org, builds on the rich musical experience of this show. There you can listen or download a recording of my unedited interview with Joe Carter, which contains several other spirituals that weren\u2019t included in this final production. We were surprised to learn that Joe never made CD recordings of these songs in his lifetime. We didn\u2019t want his flame to be lost, so we created a soundtrack of the music you\u2019ve just heard \u2014 all downloadable all free. Share these MP3s with your family and friends during this holiday season. Find them at onbeing.org. Oh, let the prayers that I\u2019ve prayed speak for me. / Oh, yes, let the love that I\u2019ve shared speak for me. Thank you so much, Joe Carter. It is my pleasure to be here. Thank you.
