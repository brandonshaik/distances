  "fullText": "\u201CLet death be what takes us,\u201D Dr. B.J. Miller has written, \u201Cnot a lack of imagination.\u201D As a palliative care physician, he brings a design sensibility to the matter of living until we die. And he\u2019s largely redesigned his own physical presence after an accident at college left him without both of his legs and part of one arm. B.J. Miller\u2019s wisdom extends to how we can all reframe our relationship to our imperfect bodies and all that we don\u2019t control. There\u2019s a big difference between things that happen to you, that are forces larger than you. I can yield to Mother Nature. I can yield to 11,000 volts. That\u2019s a very different prospect than is shutting down your imagination or rolling over altogether. So there\u2019s a challenge to our sense of proportionality in all this, and I\u2019ve loved that theme. That word \u201Cproportionality\u201D comes up for me a lot, trying to right-size myself. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. B.J. Miller is the executive director of the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, and he\u2019s an assistant clinical professor of medicine at University of California San Francisco. A self-described \u201Csuburban boy,\u201D he moved all over the U.S. growing up with his family until he attended Princeton. And there, the accident that nearly killed him set him on a path to medicine, but first to studying art. Design is such an important word for you and such an important notion that I feel runs through all your life and your work, and, to me, there is a spiritual aspect of that, expansively defined. And I\u2019m just curious about where you trace the origins of that. Would you say that you always had a \u201Cdesign sensibility,\u201D even if you didn\u2019t use that language? I would say yes. I would say I always had an aesthetic sensibility. I think one of the great things that moving around the planet did for me at a young age was, as my wiring was setting up, I was exposed to a bunch of different landscapes. And people, too, but much more diversity of landscape is at least what stuck with me. And that led to noticing changes in light and sunsets and terrain at a young age that really deeply informed me, and that later turned into interest into art. But I think at first was the natural world and the world of the senses. So I know you\u2019ve told this story so many times. You grew up, as you say, all over. You went to Princeton, and then in your sophomore year, 3:00 a.m., I believe, you climbed \u2014 was it over a subway train? No, it was a commuter train, above ground. In November sophomore year, we were just back from Thanksgiving holiday, and I was away from my friends for four days, and I\u2019d missed them. We had quite a loving group of friends at that stage. And we went out just to hang out. And it wasn\u2019t a big night. It was a Monday night. But we decided to go get a sandwich at a place called the Wawa market, which is a New Jersey phenomenon and open 24 hours. And we were walking our way to the Wawa market, which sits on the edge of campus, and in our path is this thing called the Dinky. The Dinky is a small commuter train that runs from Princeton to Princeton Junction for all the commuters. So it was just sitting there. It was not operating hours. It was just sitting there. We climbed it like you would climb a jungle gym, not at all thinking \u2014 it was not feeling like a very daring stunt at all, but I happened to be the first one up. And when I stood up, I had a metal watch on, and the electricity arced to that watch, entered the arm, and blew down and out my feet. 11,000 volts, I read? Yeah. I giggle because\u2026 Yeah, I know you\u2019re giggling \u2026 \u2026for a couple of reasons. Clearly you have worked your way through this memory. Well, it\u2019s 25 years old, and so much has flown from it. So much good has come from that experience it\u2019s remarkable. I also don\u2019t want to be Pollyannaish about it. That sends the wrong signal. But part of my chuckle is that the thing was called \u201Cthe Dinky.\u201D Part of my pride is wrapped around losing three limbs to a thing called the Dinky, but anyway. I have to say the particular moment in my life in which I read your story is when I have one child off at college and the other heading off, and even as you\u2019re telling this story, I think it would be horrific no matter what, but it\u2019s just this innocuous, playful moment. Right? Yeah, yeah. After which everything changed. Yup. Yeah, and 25 years later, you can see so much \u2014 that is, it\u2019s a change that defines your life in wonderful ways, but very dramatic. Very dramatic, yeah. That is true. But a version, a variation, on a theme that so many of us have. Little, unexpected moments, things we think are innocuous, as you say, which aren\u2019t, the surprises of a daily life that aren\u2019t always of such dramatic consequence, but they\u2019re happening all the time on various levels. And that\u2019s been a way into some curiosity, in a sense, of a little bit of mystery around it. One of the pieces of fallout that I love is this cognizance, this awareness of \u2014 I guess \u201Cfragility\u201D is the word. It\u2019s not really \u201Cfragile,\u201D it\u2019s just that we turn on these dimes all day long, and where they all collectively lead us is just fascinating. And then it\u2019s so interesting that after you had a period of recovery and returned to Princeton, you studied art history. So tell me about that decision. What went into that? Yeah, it was \u2014 like a lot of \u2014 there was an intuitive piece of it, for sure. And there was also an overlay of \u2014 a very conscious overlay of sitting in the hospital bed, trying to wrap your head around this turn in your life and, to a degree, trying to make sense of it. But mostly just trying to process it at all, and reframe myself or, really, reframe my relationship to the world around me so that I could fit into it. So I\u2019ve lost these body parts, but I remember this question: does that make me less of a person? By volume, yeah, but not in any other way. But I didn\u2019t really know how to frame it. So a long-winded way of saying, I circled to art as this peculiar thing that humans do as they process their reality, or they make sense of their world, or they affect their world, or just reflect on it. And the hunch was that art was a vehicle. Learning about art would help me learn about perspective and how to see. You have such an interesting phrase, \u201Cperspective making.\u201D Somewhere you said you had this loss of your limbs, you lost both legs below the knee and one arm below the forearm, and you said that you could no more reject this fact than reject your whole being. So it\u2019s almost like you also were getting a new sense of the perspective yourself, your body\u2019s perspective in space. Yes, totally. And the analogy of art is wonderful. I just recently interviewed this anthropologist named Mary Catherine Bateson. Are you aware of her? I\u2019m not. She\u2019s the daughter of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and her phrase is \u201Ccomposing a life,\u201D which is very \u2014 I hear echoes of that with what you\u2019re saying. And as you\u2019re saying, you had a reconfigured physical self, but you were composing a whole. Right? Your life as a whole, yourself as a whole. Yeah. That language resonates with me. I like that very much, the word \u201Ccomposing,\u201D and I like its overlay with music, which has always been important for me. But, yeah, and seeing it as a creative enterprise, as well as an adaptive one, was really very rich, and it was really like an excuse. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was sort of a melancholy child \u2014 my internal world was a little bit at odds with my external world, with the way I presented to the world. And I\u2019m sure many of us would say that, but this radical change to my body really, in a way, offered this great excuse to refashion my perspective, refashion and \u201Ccompose\u201D my sense of self. And it\u2019s so beautiful, and clearly you lived this, but I have to wonder, what did it take for you to come to that? That must have been a process. It sure was. Yeah, it sure was. I\u2019m sorry to cut you off. No, no, I just \u2026 And actually, I really appreciate you mentioning that, because sometimes I hear myself talk, and of course, it\u2019s funny how we remember things, and my mind wants to go to the beautiful side, the creative side. And part of it\u2019s born of a gratitude, the way life has played out, and I want to acknowledge all the good, but it\u2019s almost a disservice in a longer conversation, because it took a lot to get there, and sometimes I hear myself talk when I speak with others who are going through some hardship. And, certainly, the message isn\u2019t \u201CWell, just change your perspective. In a couple minutes, you\u2019ll see the world different. Everything is great. You know, quit complaining.\u201D There is a ton, I mean, buckets of physical pain, and this reworking \u2014 as if late adolescence isn\u2019t hard enough, and trying to find your way in the world as something of an adult. That\u2019s plenty hard. So all that was going on, and it really took years. This was a process that took years, and I would say, of course, is still ongoing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with Zen Hospice leader B.J. Miller. There is a wonderful line \u2014 I think you said it in your TED talk. It comes up on the Zen Hospice Project website. \u201CLet death be what takes us, not lack of imagination.\u201D Those are your words? They are, yeah. It\u2019s a stunning, wonderful sentence, so talk about how you how came to that and what that means for you, what that holds for you. Well, it\u2019s very much along the lines of what we\u2019re talking, that there\u2019s a big difference between things that happen to you, that are forces larger than you. I can yield to Mother Nature. I can yield to 11,000 volts. That\u2019s a very different prospect than is shutting down your imagination or rolling over altogether or losing yourself altogether. So there is a way, there\u2019s a needle to be threaded here of both acknowledging these forces much larger than ourselves and, for me, bowing before them. There is an allegiance, in a way, to these things that are much larger. And at the same time, any sort of proportionality and right-sizing in that math also means \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re nothing. You may be a speck of sand in time, but a speck of sand is something. You may be a drop in the bucket, but the bucket would be different without your drop in it. So there\u2019s a proportionality \u2013 a challenge to our sense of proportionality in all this, and I\u2019ve loved that theme. That word \u201Cproportionality\u201D comes up for me a lot, to right-size myself. Say some more. We have this capacity as human beings to change ourselves and change things around us. And if you\u2019re not careful, that capacity and then expectations that flow from it can run away with you, and all of a sudden you feel like, gosh, if I don\u2019t change the world today, I\u2019ve failed. Or if I don\u2019t cure cancer tomorrow, I\u2019ve failed. Or if I don\u2019t beat death. Trying to find enough gumption and wherewithal to respond and to try to do things while not being so overblown in your expectations that you feel bad for not changing something that\u2019s unchangeable. And for me, that\u2019s a really tricky and dynamic equation that\u2019s changing all the time. And that particular form of suffering \u2014 let\u2019s call it that \u2014 that challenge of proportionality is a burden of people who are privileged, in a way, right? To even have that aspiration or that sense handed to you that you have so much that you should be able to change the world or defeat whatever obstacles are put in front of you. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s so funny. I watch when people try to wrap their head around it when I talk to them. Am I, B.J., the least lucky person in the world or the most lucky person in the world? And I don\u2019t know, sometimes I think I\u2019m a little of both, as I\u2019m sure many of us are. Most of us are, to some degree. Depends who you\u2019re comparing yourself to, et cetera. For sure, just think about my backdrop. Again, I was not \u2014 think about my education and whatever personality threads and through-lines there have been that I\u2019ve inherited. Much of what we\u2019re talking about here, which \u2014 and this sense of proportionality and changing anything \u2014 it\u2019s a very privileged position to be speaking from. And, I would also add, Krista, I think it\u2019s also true \u2014 although I want to be careful that I\u2019m not speaking for people whose situations I don\u2019t understand \u2014 but there\u2019s something about just getting through the day. Being a human being, I don\u2019t care what your circumstances are. Some of the most miserable people I know are by some measure the luckiest. I think being a human being is just inherently difficult, and so getting through the day is sort of a creative process and a proportional \u2014 a process of proportioning yourself. Anyway, there\u2019s a lot to say about that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all about privilege. No, I don\u2019t, either. I actually think there\u2019s a subtler point, which you just got at. You said something really important, I think. You said a minute ago that you were a melancholy child. And I don\u2019t think you used the word \u201Crelief,\u201D but you said you had always \u2014 there had been kind of a disconnect for you between your inner life and what you maybe thought you should be in the world, and I think that\u2019s true. As you say, that\u2019s a human characteristic, and it comes with whatever conditions or circumstances we have. You said that when you had this accident and this trauma and this physical suffering that you finally had some suffering other people could see. I think that\u2019s really important, right? Amen. Yeah, I was thinking about that driving over here, actually, Krista. The part of the difference in my experience of being alive has a lot to do with how the world responds to me. And the fact that I have these very obvious disabilities means that people treat me differently, so that\u2019s a huge piece of this equation, and a very interesting one, and one that\u2019s out of my control. And especially in my role in medicine, I find it\u2019s very useful, that my body and its obvious suffering is very useful. It\u2019s a means of building trust with people who are also suffering from their body failing in one way or another. So it is interesting to note how much of this transformation we\u2019re talking about, A, isn\u2019t really much of a transformation, and, B, has to do with people outside of myself more than inside of myself. But the transformation that you were compelled to \u2014 as much as we all carry whatever our suffering is, and it has infinite variety, we are taught to hide it, and to hold onto it. But what you were compelled to do is let it \u2014 is for it to be seen. And that\u2019s a huge move. Now you work in hospice, and that\u2019s this unavoidable move that people have to make in accepting that they are dying. Yeah. I will \u2014 speaking of proportionality, trying to find, for my own sense of confidence, I often wonder, what can I take credit for? This stuff. And one of those decisions is to come out of the closet, in a way, as a disabled person. And I think about this idea of normalcy a lot. I and many, many others before me have been agents of normalizing disability, and that\u2019s really potent. And I also think there\u2019s a second half to that equation, that we need \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean that we fit these other things into our idea of normal, it means we expand our idea of normal. And I think that life is weird. Life\u2019s hard. Life\u2019s weird. Humans are weird. And I worry, sometimes, that we exist in such a narrow bandwidth of accepted behaviors and thoughts that we really clip off so much of the strange beauty that can be part of the human experience. And back to your point, I remember I was about two or three or four years into my odyssey in these shoes, and the norm for lower limb prostheses, the norm was that you put these flesh-colored foam covers over your legs so that they look more natural, and they have the shape of a leg. And I remember studying architecture at Princeton, modern architecture in particular, and about Louis Sullivan and others pulling the appliqu\u00E9 off the buildings and delighting in the structure itself. And that was just such a mind-blower for me. And so I pulled the covers off my legs and started to force myself, and then to genuinely delight in this weird structure that now was my legs. I love these legs. These legs aren\u2019t some cheap imitation of what I lost. These are wholly new things. These are different things that deserve their own space and credit. I love them, and I am interested in how they look. So that was very therapeutic for me, and I will take a little credit for whatever courage that day helped me do that. And, similarly, for my arm, I have a lot of skin grafting on my arm. And I wore a sock over it for years. At first, it was this white medical stocking, and then I got a little creative and started wearing paisley or argyle socks on the arm to have a little bit of style around it. And then, maybe, again, around the same period, maybe five years in, I just pulled the sock off one morning. I didn\u2019t feel the need to cover it up anymore, and that was just a spontaneous moment. And, subconsciously, I think I had been working towards that for years. And one day I just didn\u2019t need it anymore. Those moments \u2014 there was some courage in those moments. Wonderful. There was moments of just willing myself out into public view that I remember was very awkward and uncomfortable, but I knew it was a good thing for me to do, and perhaps a good thing for others around me to see. I\u2019d love to \u2014 I\u2019ve seen pictures of your prosthetic legs, and this image is becoming \u2014 as these things are more out there and available to people, it is becoming part of our imagination about the human body, I think, so interestingly. But I\u2019d love to hear how you would describe your legs. Tell me what you see when you look at your legs, that beauty that you see. Well, there\u2019s the beauty of the carbon fiber weave \u2014 carbon, our basic, organic substrate. Here it is in these sheets of woven material that are so strong, so light, such a nod to both Mother Nature and to human ingenuity for harnessing it. So we\u2019ve got this beautiful, black carbon weave. If you buy your sports car, you\u2019ll pay extra to have a carbon fiber door or panel. It\u2019s an acknowledged aesthetic. So, first, I noticed the color. Then I noticed the sculptural quality of the piece, what\u2019s called the socket, and the socket is what goes around my stump, what\u2019s left of my fleshy leg. And that is sculpted to my leg, so it is a piece of sculpture. This is where the craft comes in, and it has sculptural qualities to it. It reveals the shape of my stump. And then, below that, you\u2019ve got this \u2014 I\u2019ve had various feet over the years. Some of them have these very narrow, skinny little ankles. It\u2019s almost a version of what I feel like when I look at a horse \u2014 that incredible power, those beautiful thighs on these teeny, tiny little ankles. And it\u2019s similar, not quite that dramatic, but it\u2019s a little similar with prosthetic feet, because, in a way, we are able to construct things which are stronger than bone and don\u2019t need all the support structures. So that\u2019s what I see when I look at my legs. The piece that has bummed me out for years now is what\u2019s left to chance at the level of the shoe. And shut me up here, Krista, because I could go on on this one for a while. No, it\u2019s great. I love it. Keep going. Well, the shoe \u2014 you\u2019ve got this incredibly engineered, crafted leg that I was just describing, and then at the final moment where that leg is interfacing with the ground, with Mother Earth, with the thing that it\u2019s meant to affect, it\u2019s left to chance. There is this thing called the \u201Cfoot shell\u201D which is this pink-colored \u2014 very often it\u2019ll have these faux toes on it \u2014 rubber thing that goes over your prosthetic foot so that it will take on the shape of a, quote-unquote, \u201Cnormal\u201D foot so that you can wear normal shoes. And as we\u2019ve been talking, I don\u2019t want to pass. Darn it, why this final element is left to this compromised design state has always bothered me greatly. And the fact of it is, really, no one has built shoes for prosthetic feet before. I don\u2019t have all those little bones that you guys have. It doesn\u2019t need to have that silly shape. It can look totally different. But we haven\u2019t gotten there yet. You can listen again and share this conversation with B.J. Miller through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with B.J. Miller. He\u2019s the executive director of the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco. And the personal passion for design that he takes into his thinking about living and dying and medicine was galvanized by a freak accident while he was a college student in which he lost both of his legs and part of one arm. So many of the ways you talk about and seem to think about and just approach what you do, palliative care and hospice, is also completely interwoven with this design sensibility that we\u2019ve been talking about all the way through, and these aesthetics and the language you use and the images you use. For example, you say, \u201COur shared mortality is a source of great beauty.\u201D What do you mean when you say that? The fact that we have these bookends of birth and death and in between feels like a guitar solo \u2014 in between, all sorts of crazy things can happen. But the song begins and the song ends, at least for this bodily life. And the fact that we share, that 100 percent of us across time and space, across cultures, that all of us share that version of fate is compelling to me. So finding a purchase, a toehold in what we share and all that we share opens me up in a way that I feel \u2014 that feels beautiful, that makes me love people more, not less, that makes me more open to people, not less, makes me more open to myself, not less. So it\u2019s an observation of what \u2014 when I start thinking about this common fate, looking within myself \u2014 what does it do to me? Well, that\u2019s what it does to me, and that seems very good. Yeah. And \u201Cquality of life\u201D is an overused phrase, which is not to say that it doesn\u2019t have meaning, but it\u2019s an overused phrase. But I feel like when you paraphrase it in this way \u2014 you talk about \u2014 that hospice is about living fully into our last breath. And the fact that this \u2014 hospice and palliative care, which are so new, that hospitals were never designed to do that, to help people live fully into their last breath. I mean, you even pointed out that the word \u201Canesthetic\u201D is literally the opposite of \u201Caesthetic,\u201D that hospitals assault the senses. Yeah. You\u2019ve also talked about time as such an important concept for you. Say something about that. Yeah. Existentialism, being in \u2026 Yeah, and it kind of flows out of that. Yeah. Being and Time, right? Heidegger and others have talked about \u2014 our relationship to time is foundational for the human experience, and that makes sense to me. Why? Because we have this weird facility to imagine the future and remember the past. And right there, that set us up to have some relationship to the clock. And when we \u2014 as conscious human beings, we know we die, and we therefore know our clock ends on, some level. So time just seems foundational. And I think a lot of the gymnastics that we do as human beings has to do with our relationship to the clock, or lack of a relationship to the clock. We squander time until it\u2019s too late, et cetera. I love looking at the building blocks, the raw material, the irreducibles. So space and time are two components that I want to feel and I want to work with. And watching the clock is, I think, a big part of my job as a palliative care and hospice doc. That\u2019s how I see a big chunk of my job. And, somehow, when you are dying, you have no choice, or there\u2019s a particular urgency about facing that. But aging is something we\u2019re all doing all the time and not necessarily choosing to face it. Yeah. You said somewhere you want to think about aging and dying as a process of crescendo through to the end. Yeah. This is where the aspirational, and reconciling the aspirational with the realities on the ground is tricky. And from my love of design and aesthetics, beauty, I have to be very careful that we don\u2019t set ourselves up for yet another thing to fail at. So it\u2019s tricky, but what I want to do \u2014 and it\u2019s partly that comment about I don\u2019t want to die of a lack of imagination \u2014 I don\u2019t want to have our systems predetermined that we fade out. I don\u2019t want to have our systems designed and predetermined that I peak in my life when I\u2019m most productive. So when there\u2019s ever a moment to design the context, to create the construct, I want to make sure we take that very, very seriously, and don\u2019t accidentally predetermine misery that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be there. So that\u2019s really what I\u2019m calling for. We can\u2019t all experience aging and dying as a crescendo, but if we make space for that possibility, then it\u2019s much more likely to happen. And I do think from some \u2014 as your body ceases to be your best friend, as this painless agent that takes you all over the planet, as your mind may fade, there is always something, whether it\u2019s a sense of smell or touch or a thought, there\u2019s something living in you until you are dead, and one of the conceptual things \u2014 it sounds kind of silly, but I love saying this people, to students\u00A0\u2014 dying people are living. We talk about \u201Cthe dying\u201D as though they\u2019re some other species over in the corner. We are the dying, and seeing ourselves in that mix is very fruitful in a number of ways, but it also allows us to see dying as a part of living. And therefore, we can design that as an experience. For me, it gets very interesting to define death. What is death to me? There is a legal definition of that. I cease to have any cardiovascular function, and my brain no longer talks to my body, or whatever. There are clinical ways so that my doctor and my lawyer can pronounce me dead, but when am I\u00A0\u2014 for my own purposes, when am I dead? When am I really done with this life? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see as I get closer to it, but from where I sit, at this point I\u2019m very clear \u2014 when I can no longer sense anything, whenever I can no longer take in the world around me in any way, then I\u2019m dead. And that brings me back to this life of the senses and the immediacy of the senses. And the one thing I know is that the body dies. This body dies, and this body is just a big sack of sensors. So that\u2019s the big loop for you right there. We\u2019ve talked about this all the way through the conversation, about the matter of disability. And I just want to read something you wrote, because I feel like this is very fluid, also \u2014 how we are thinking about disability, what we\u2019re calling it. And in your lifetime, in our lifetime, this has been very fluid. You wrote, \u201CBack in 1990, I was treated as a Frankenstein figure or a Christ figure, and it was ridiculous at either extreme. Sometimes I got congratulated for going to the bathroom. Then somewhere along the way, amputees seemed to bust out and a handful went out and did extraordinary things, competing in Ironman triathlons, and the expectations changed. If I didn\u2019t climb Mount Everest, I had failed.\u201D Yeah, I still own those words very much. And again, I\u2019m thinking about the aesthetic. Sometimes, when people write about you, they use the language of \u2014 they describe you as a \u201Ctriple amputee,\u201D which is technically true, but to me, it\u2019s just such \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really describe you. It\u2019s very antiseptic language. So I\u2019m curious about how you think about even the language of disability, but also how we\u2019re working with that and struggling with it. This is where \u2014 really, disability and chronic illness was my way into hospice and palliative care, much more than death, per se, by the way. But disability, it points us \u2014 a big theme for me back as an undergraduate and my senior thesis, a subcurrent was my frustration with language. That words can point to things. I know words have their own life as well, but I still struggle with how much potency words have. Like what are words that you struggle with? Well, just the whole \u2014 well, let\u2019s just start with you asked about disability. I mean, I\u2019m OK with it, but what was not discussed is, compared to what? What\u2019s the frame of reference? What\u2019s the \u201Cdis-\u201D? That\u2019s implied. We can step back and discuss it, and I love when people do, but otherwise you just accept on face, \u201Cdisability,\u201D that you are less, that it\u2019s something pathological happening. But compared to what? So this relativism of language and the idea of words as signposts, as imperfect reproductions of the reality they\u2019re trying to point to, I just want that to be acknowledged whenever I\u2019m in a serious conversation, that words are the best we have, but they\u2019re so flawed. I just need that to be acknowledged somewhere. I mean, it\u2019s kind of back to that idea that we\u2019re all carrying around whatever our forms of suffering and struggle are, and some of them show on the outside. And those we call \u201Cdisability\u201D \u2026 Right. Again, \u201Cwounded healer,\u201D \u201Cdisabled.\u201D If everyone considered themselves disabled, I\u2019m all for it. Same thing. I remember when I would go \u2014 I haven\u2019t done this is in years, but I would go to \u2014 people would invite me to come speak to their classroom, schools, often high schools, or when kids would approach me in a park or something and say, in, invariably, the same way, \u201CHey, don\u2019t you miss having two hands?\u201D Some version of that question would come up, or \u201Ctwo feet?\u201D or whatever. And I would say, \u201CWell, sure. Yes, I do. I really miss having two hands.\u201D Oh boy, do I miss having two hands. I mean what a treat. You can keep the feet, but I would love \u2014 I mean, hands are remarkable. But I would say to these kids, \u201CYeah. Well, don\u2019t you miss having three?\u201D They\u2019re like, what? They just look at me kind of funny. And I don\u2019t know how many of them ever \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that retort ever did any good for any child, but the point was, this is my reality. Having one hand is my complete and total reality. It\u2019s not a half a reality, and I don\u2019t see too many two-handers ruing the fact that they don\u2019t have three hands. And, yet, it\u2019s basically the same relationship to something you can\u2019t control. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with B.J. Miller of San Francisco\u2019s Zen Hospice Project. You\u2019ve talked about love and joy and great hope as experiences of dying when it\u2019s done well. And I wonder how you would \u2014 what does great hope mean at the end of life, as you\u2019ve experienced hope at the end of life? Hope is such a funny thing. It\u2019s such a squirrely thing. We can do damage with hope, too. It\u2019s a powerful thing. A lot of the data around why some physicians don\u2019t share the full truth of a prognosis with their patients \u2014 and, invariably, you\u2019ll hear some version of, \u201CWell, because I don\u2019t want to take away their hope.\u201D And they know that hope is what gets them out of bed in the morning, and wills them to try the next therapy, or whatever it is. Hope is very potent thing. But in my training in palliative care, I learned, whenever I hear that word, whenever I hear the phrase \u201CI hope for,\u201D I\u2019m trained now to ask, to inquire, \u201CHope for what?\u201D And that, too, is a relative phenomenon that needs to be contextualized, and is much more fluid and malleable than we in healthcare often give it credit for, or we humans give it credit it for. It seems to be like a monolith. Either you have hope, or you don\u2019t. The truth is, we can change what we hope for. And you watch in palliative care, for example, and hospice, that sort of medicine is done well when these informed, skilled conversations play out. You\u2019ll hear providers work with the person\u2019s hope but redirect it. So when I ask someone who is facing the end of their life, if I\u2019m trying to help them understand that time is short, I will talk about what they hope for in their life. And if I hear them say, \u201CWell, I hope to live another 30 years,\u201D but I know they\u2019ve got three weeks, there is a big red flag for me to say, \u201CYou know what, man? What if that doesn\u2019t happen? Then what might you hope for? If time is shorter than that, what\u2019s at the essence of your hope?\u201D And invariably \u2014 well, not invariably, but very often you can get folks to a place where they say, \u201CWell, gosh, given that reality, what I really hope for is to get to my daughter\u2019s graduation.\u201D And then I say, \u201COK, well, there\u2019s a goal we can work with.\u201D And if someone says to me, \u201CWell, I hope to live forever,\u201D then I call that a miracle, and I say \u201CWell, let\u2019s hope for miracles together.\u201D It\u2019s just \u2014 there is a lot to say about this word, \u201Chope.\u201D It\u2019s something that there is a lot to work with there. But back to answer your question, when time is short, when people are facing the end of life, it\u2019s not necessarily a hopeless endeavor. They may hope to have one more piece of pizza, or they may hope to see that last episode of a show they love. But it can be realistic, and it can pull people along so that they are actually able to play themselves all the way out. And that\u2019s that \u201Cliving until your final breath\u201D thing. It\u2019s interesting to me. You work with death as this normal thing, this practical reality, something we\u2019re all \u2014 we\u2019re all dying, right? That\u2019s another reason that the physician is a patient, too, right? We\u2019re all dying. Yeah, exactly. Yes. But you seem to hold it together with this enduring kind of reverence, or honoring the mystery of death itself. Do you feel like you understand or that you reckon differently with death as part of your life, differently because of this life you\u2019ve been leading? Is it less of a mystery? It\u2019s a great question. There is a history in my field of some spectacularly difficult deaths of people who worked in hospice. I think the admonition to us \u2014 \u201Cus\u201D meaning those of us who work in this field, whether volunteer or physician or nurse or whatever \u2014 is that you don\u2019t seduce yourself into thinking that you know death, that you understand, oh, I\u2019ve got it now. I\u2019ve been through \u2014 I\u2019ve been around this block a million times with folks. I got it. So when it\u2019s my time, I\u2019m going to be fine. That is really dangerous. That\u2019s like jinxing yourself. Some of this is knowable, and, for example, teasing out dying and the implied suffering. Dying is different from death, and teasing \u2014 most of us are afraid of dying because it implies suffering. And when you get down to it, that\u2019s what most people are worried about. The dying rather than the death of the being. Yeah. So there is a lot I have learned that will help me suffer less, that can help me help others suffer less in that dying process. But I do not pretend to know or understand death per se. And part of what I do, the reverence that you point to is, again, back to this mystery, this thing that I don\u2019t understand that\u2019s much larger than myself, and that \u2014 what happens after I die? I don\u2019t know. And, boy, isn\u2019t that interesting? So part of my work, and, I think, when we talk to students, is, yeah, familiarize yourself with the concept of death, and certainly with the concept of dying, but don\u2019t seduce yourself into thinking that you totally know it. Because, otherwise, you\u2019re going to find yourself standing at your horizon one day, and you\u2019re going to be really, extra shocked to learn that you\u2019re terrified when you just assumed you wouldn\u2019t be. So it\u2019s easy, just make a little bit of space. That\u2019s the mystery to it. Yeah. That\u2019s the mystery, too. Right. You\u2019ve just got to protect a little bit of space for all that you don\u2019t know. So you know, my last question, you\u2019ve had an extraordinary life. A lot has happened to you. You\u2019ve taken a lot, and you have this great accident early in your life, the kind of redesign of your life, and the career you\u2019ve had and, now, working with people. And in some ways, you could talk about \u2014 what you do is help people design, compose their dying, the end of their lives. This is a huge question, but how would you start to think about what all of this is teaching you about what it means to be human? And I think that another way to ask that is how you carry all of this into the way you spend your days, your life. Yeah. It\u2019s a hot question, and it\u2019s an ever-present one. It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m 44, and I look back and, by most measures, I have had a pretty extraordinary life. And at the same time, one of the most adaptive skills I picked up over the years is really \u2014 when you all of a sudden become a triple amputee or anything like that, you\u2019re sent a bunch of signals that you\u2019re different, now, from people around you. And if you stop there, you can really hurt yourself. And you get treated specially, and that has its own seduction, too, and pity. And you can get stuff from pity, and it\u2019s really one of the great graveyards in traversing all this for me. If I were to really yield to this idea that, \u201COh yeah, I\u2019m different than those around me,\u201D and just leave it at that, I would have just inserted a wedge between myself and everyone around me that ultimately would not serve me. We are social creatures, and one of the most important things I\u2019ve ever done was to hit on this idea of seeing variations on themes. So, sure, my body is different in a lot of ways. In a lot of ways, my life is different. But ultimately, I see them as variations on themes, and that allows me to acknowledge what\u2019s relatively unique in my life, but also to see myself as just like anybody else in a very truthful and real way, not just made up. So that\u2019s part of my answer to your question. But this idea\u00A0\u2014 I struggle with this. I\u2019m a very busy person, like so many of us. Stupidly busy. Here I have \u2014 from my own experiences, but I have what I call all these vicarious deathbed experiences all the time. I\u2019m around people who are dying. And I, of all people, know that time is precious. Don\u2019t squander it doing things you don\u2019t care about. Don\u2019t give it away too cheaply, blah, blah, blah. Spend less time at work, more time with family, whatever it may be, you know. I have no excuse to forget that. Zip. And, yet, I find myself incredibly and increasingly busy, sometimes out on limbs doing things that I don\u2019t necessarily want to do or even believe in, on some level. And there is some real moral distress in that. I think that is part of how we burn out, is you have these lessons, but we find ourselves still unable to actualize some of these lessons. So it\u2019s a hot question for me right now, Krista. I\u2019ve got to figure out \u2014 I\u2019ve got to constantly retool myself and rejigger how I spend my time. I\u2019m aware that I have too many friendships that have gone fallow. I\u2019m aware that I spend too little time with my parents, and there are other examples. So I\u2019ve got to reproportion myself again. But you know, what you\u2019re just describing, I mean, you have a consciousness about, what did you say, that we know what we want and, actually, what we should do, and what would be good for us, and we have trouble aligning reality with that. I mean, that is the human condition. That\u2019s the nub of it. You\u2019re working with that. I am working with that. But you\u2019re also pointing to \u2014 as I get frustrated with how I\u2019m spending my time, sometimes, or not spending my time, not treating it with the preciousness I know it deserves \u2026 Not designing your time. Yeah. That\u2019s right. And, ultimately, I\u2019m landing back, and this is where it is. And this is a creative pursuit, one that takes \u2014 sails which need trimming all the time. And seeing this as a creative work that is never done is great, is beautiful, and I\u2019d like to land there. It\u2019s probably a good stopping point. And so all that we just described, even if I can\u2019t honor every minute of every day in this most precious way, well, ultimately, it\u2019s just another thing I get to forgive in myself and to keep trying tomorrow.
