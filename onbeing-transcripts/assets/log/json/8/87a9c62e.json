  "fullText": "We\u2019re trying to get back to some of these basics of loving people, of caring for people, of being kind and compassionate. And from there, letting the perception of what it means to be Christian play itself out. Because we can\u2019t control that \u2014 but what we can control are our actions and how we\u2019re choosing to engage in a new moment. That\u2019s Gabe Lyons. He grew up in Jerry Falwell\u2019s church, then went out into the world to discover that the word \u201CChristian\u201D had become a frightening term in places in American culture. He\u2019s now a 30-something thought leader for many young Christians and evangelicals who are reimagining their part in common life, common good \u2014 something much bigger than politics. And I spoke with Gabe Lyons in a public event at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs together with another unlikely agent of change on the conservative Christian spectrum. Jim Daly is the president of Focus on the Family. I think when Christian leaders, the older Christian leadership says, \u201CWhere are those future leaders? They\u2019re just not there.\u201D They want gladiators. They want culture warriors. And the amazing thing is I think God is answering their question and they don\u2019t even see it. The next Christians, an untold story of our time and a dialogue of the Civil Conversations Project. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. So as I said to Jim and Gabe, something I\u2019ve been very aware of in recent election seasons is how religious voices and perspectives, Christians in particular, evangelicals in particular, get discussed in very narrow terms as a voting block. So very quick history lesson: About a century ago, the people we now know as evangelicals really withdrew from public life and political life. This voice re-emerged in American public life in the last 30 or 40 years most vigorously represented by figures like Jerry Falwell, whose church Gabe Lyons attended in his childhood, and James Dobson who preceded Jim Daly as the founding president of Focus on the Family. And then in the past decade, there\u2019s been a real ongoing self-searching reassessment by emerging leaders in this world of evangelical Christianity. I think that\u2019s a story that hasn\u2019t really been told, and I think we\u2019re going to experience it tonight. Gabe Lyons founded his fascinating learning community, Q, out of his experience as part of a generation of young Christians who expressed themselves as disheartened by the harsh and very politicized associations that the word \u201CChristian\u201D had come to hold in many ears. And since Jim Daly has become president of, what, as I was doing this research, I routinely found this referred to as a right-wing evangelical powerhouse. Powerhouse? Yes. He \u2014 he\u2019s also been on a private and public journey asking what\u2019s the strategy of intense political engagement has affected, and also I really hear you asking how to be convicted and truthful an gracious and loving, right? How to balance your words, your rhetoric, your fervor for truth with these tenets of your faith. So I want to start with you, Jim. You know, to say that your childhood was difficult is really an understatement. Both of your parents were alcoholic. They were divorced when you were very young. Your mother died when you were nine, your father, when you were 12. It can\u2019t be a stretch to suggest that, if someone had told you at the age of 12 or 15, that you would one day head an organization called Focus on the Family, it would have seemed a bit unimaginable. Well, walking down the hall with Don Hodel who came in to be the temporary president of Focus on the Family, really helping Dr. Dobson in the initial transition, and he turned to me and said, \u201CWe think you\u2019re the guy.\u201D I laughed. The irony, the humor of it, you know, I lived in just about every family type. I had a normal dysfunctional mom and dad and then I had a single-parent mom that really worked hard. I was born in the \u201960s. She worked three jobs at times to take care of five kids. Then my mom remarried a really difficult stepfather, Hank, and they were married about a year and a half and then my mom died of cancer and Hank walked out the door the day of her funeral. I remember to this day him just leaving the house. Then we moved into foster care, so I had that experience. Then I moved back with my biological father and he died within a year and then I lived during junior high and high school with my brother who was only seven years older than me. I used to say, \u201CWhat time you want me to come home Friday night after the football game?\u201D He\u2019d say, \u201CWell, try to get home by two or three in the morning.\u201D I remember thinking I\u2019ll try to stay out that late . But it is a very different background than Dr. Dobson. He was born in the \u201930s and had a loving mother and father. But when I struggled with that, it was more like God \u2014 what I felt God saying in my heart is that represents so much more of the culture today. And when I speak about it, so many teens and college-age kids, they\u2019ve lived a portion of that life and that\u2019s where I connect and that\u2019s what I\u2019m enjoying is being there to let people know you can overcome these things. And, Gabe, you grew up in Virginia and you went to Jerry Falwell\u2019s church and you went to Liberty University. Yep. Yep. My whole experience growing up in the small town, Lynchburg, Virginia, was going to the church, going to the Christian school. I went on to Liberty University. So until I was about age 22, I had pretty sufficiently grown up in what I now would describe as a bubble of kind of evangelical Christianity. And it\u2019s not to say that was a bad bubble. I had amazing experiences and wouldn\u2019t really change anything about it. But it was when I was 22, graduated from college, moved to San Diego to kind of begin my career and my life that it was a really cold awakening to realize how much of a bubble I had grown up in. There was a huge adjustment that I had to go through over those next few years to kind of recalibrate to how do you relate to people who really don\u2019t respect your faith and have a lot of good reasons for why they don\u2019t respect your faith that they\u2019re bringing at you all the time. So that recalibration for me was a key part of my journey and story to lead to, you know, the journey that I\u2019m on today. And then it seems to me that the way you approached your curiosity about that and your confusion about that was really to face it head on. You ended up embarking on this study, which resulted in a book called Unchristian, which really laid out \u2014 well, what were the five top words? Sixteen- to 29-year-olds, the five top words associated with the word \u201CChristian\u201D was anti-homosexual, judgmental, hypocritical, too political, and boring. Yeah. Wonderful adjectives, huh? Not bad, huh? So that was my cold awakening was, wow, this is who I am to the rest of the world. This is who our faith represents, this is who they perceived Jesus to be. These are the things they believe Jesus cares about, this is the way they believe Jesus thinks we ought to be operating in the world, and it was embarrassing. I was ashamed to call myself a Christian. I didn\u2019t want to make that pronouncement about myself because I knew what it meant to people. And I knew it wasn\u2019t true of what it meant to follow Jesus, but I \u2026 Right. That wasn\u2019t your experience, but it was your experience of how people perceived this faith that still meant a great deal to you, that still meant everything to you. Correct. Yeah, well \u2014 well, I will say as Christian growing up, I mean, I think I\u2019ve become a pretty judgmental Christian. I mean, definitely my view of the world was those who disagree with my point of view are wrong; I\u2019ve got it all figured out, a very self-righteousness about what I believed. And all of that had to be broken down in me. I mean, there was a moment of just total repentance when I recognized how much I was a part of the problem. And I think that\u2019s a key part for so many of my generation is recognizing and acknowledging how much we have contributed to the pain that people feel in American culture when they think about the Church, when they think about Christians. And so it became really important to me that I bring together people who were thinking similarly as I was thinking about this and start to create something that would give voice to Christians who were not satisfied with this being the reputation of Jesus. And so Q became an event that we do once a year. Online qideas.org is our website, where we constantly have articles and content that we\u2019re trying to put out that start to give people maybe a bigger picture of how Christians are thinking about everything in the world today. And it seems to me you\u2019re also giving Christians a bigger picture of everything that\u2019s happening in the world, right? It\u2019s a TED-like gathering where you bring people who are in science and the arts and politics. I want to say I\u2019ve been following it for a long time and I always wondered what the Q stood for. And I thought it probably stood for Quelle, a Q, which in New Testament studies it\u2019s a lost source of the Gospels. And then at a stretch, I thought maybe it was the great supernatural character in Star Trek: The Next Generation. That\u2019s where I was going. But that was just me. But then, I learned it stands for \u201Cquestions,\u201D which is more simple, but also very refreshing. Yeah. I think \u2014 I think I\u2019d realized that for too long we\u2019d had all the answers to everybody\u2019s problems and to even the questions nobody was asking. And so Q becomes a place where it\u2019s not just presentations, but conversations around the table. What we\u2019re finding now after six Q\u2019s and having done this for six years, that people are leaving and going back in their communities and doing things differently and embodying a different way of being Christian than many of their neighbors maybe had ever experienced. It\u2019s been \u2014 it seems to have been refreshing not only for them, but for their communities. And you say that the word that\u2019s absolutely critical for you or anybody trying to understand this is \u201Crestore.\u201D Restoration, restore, what does that word hold for you? Well, I use term \u201Crestores\u201D because I think it just gives us a picture. I mean, most of us have gone through the experience of taking something old that was broken down and the hard work of trying to get it back to what its original design was, and I think that best describes how Christians are thinking today. They\u2019re looking at a world that has tons of brokenness not only in their own lives, but even in society and in our structures, our business systems, our governments, all around us, and we\u2019re part of those problems. But they have an attitude about it that says, look, part of what God\u2019s mission in the world is to renew all things. We\u2019re pretty excited that we get to be a part of partnering with people not who all agree with us, but have different beliefs or no belief at all to say, look, we\u2019re part of the mission of God to see things renewed, to see things broken down restored. And we need to embody that, we need to live that and express that. So your word is \u201Crestore\u201D and, Jim, your word is \u201Crefocus.\u201D You have a book coming out right now that\u2019s on the presses as we speak \u2014 soon. What does that word hold for you? Well, I think for me, it\u2019s not looking back and being sour or doubting that strategy. You know, I wasn\u2019t born in the \u201930s. A lot of those figures you talk about, Jerry Falwell, Dr. Dobson, they were born in the \u201930s, \u201940s. They lived in a different country than we live in today. You know, Judeo-Christian values were commonly agreed upon. I mean, this is what we do and generally the culture embraces those things. To have those things slip away, I can understand in part why they engage vigorously in that area. But when you look at the way forward, if we\u2019re just building a fortress, we\u2019re failing at the very call of Christianity. So in that context, refocus for me is really finding a way that\u2019s more New Testament-rooted, that we speak kindly, we speak gently to the world. I think one of the mistakes that we\u2019ve made is we tend to speak harshly toward the world and gently toward our own. It\u2019s not what the Scripture teaches, you know. Let\u2019s hold each other accountable as Christians as believers, but when we\u2019re engaging the world, let\u2019s show compassion. So in concrete terms, you know, what \u2014 how does this affect you? What does this change? Because I don\u2019t think that the core values or the essential mission of Focus on the Family has shifted. Maybe I\u2019m wrong about that or I don\u2019t know if you would say it that way. But tell me what this works in you. What difference does that make? I think the one thing that it does bring about in terms of change is just tone. Principles, we can\u2019t abandon those. I mean, as Christians, we want to follow those. We need to follow those and those are some big issues and we may talk about some of those tonight, whether it\u2019s marriage or life, whatever it might be. But the irony is, when I\u2019ve engaged people that don\u2019t agree with me, as long as I\u2019m sincere and respectful, we can have a discussion. You know, what I said a minute ago is maybe not \u2014 you have evolved things in some ways, right? I mean, Focus on the Family has been working to overturn Roe vs. Wade, has been in the forefront of that. But I see you also saying that hasn\u2019t happened and wanting to be engaged with people on the other side of that politically to say how do we save lives? How do we care for children? You\u2019re working on things like foster care, which is a system that you know personally. I mean, is that also growing out of \u2014 you know, because when you say \u201Ctone,\u201D that might just be the surface, but I sense that it\u2019s much deeper than that. No, I appreciate that. I think that\u2019s true. You know, I know people that have good hearts and good intentions that don\u2019t agree with me in these areas. I think that is a majority of people. I think that, when you look at the issue of abortion in this country, more than 50 percent now consider it immoral, that we need to do better. I think it would be wonderful if we could find solutions. Although there is a choice, can we choose life more often? I\u2019m willing to talk to people and I\u2019ve had meetings behind the scenes with people that would not agree with us on the life position, but they acknowledge that that would be a good thing. And if we can find a way to allow more children to come in this world, I think everybody wins. And I\u2019m willing to sacrifice our reputation for the sake of those kids, and I think that\u2019s worthy. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CThe Next Christians.\u201D Jim Daly is president of Focus on the Family, and Gabe Lyons is founder of Q, which stands for questions. There\u2019s an interesting piece in the Colorado Springs Independent. I think Colorado Springs is an interesting place, isn\u2019t it? It is. Have you been there a few times? I haven\u2019t. But it has all these \u2014 I have all these different associations with Colorado Springs from yoga capital of the world to Focus on the Family, and they don\u2019t quite go together. So, I mean, this little publication had actually given you, or Focus on the Family, something called the \u201CShame Award,\u201D had been very critical of Focus on the Family. You\u2019ve done your research. Yes, I have. Then there\u2019s this interesting piece that comes out at some point because you engaged, right? Did you accept the invitation to the Shame Award? Well, it was funny. Actually, Gary Schneeberger, to his credit \u2014 he\u2019s here in the audience tonight. So Gary came to me and said, \u201CYou know, I think we should accept the award. And I said, \u201CI think you\u2019re right.\u201D So the problem it created for them is they had over the years nobody had ever shown up to accept this award. So it kind of put them a little on their heels. They weren\u2019t even looking for your RSVP. Yeah, but, you know, I\u2019ve got to say, John Weiss, who is the owner of the Independent, is a classic example of what we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s a Berkeley-Harvard guy, worked on Henry Waxman\u2019s campaign. He would be self-described as a pretty strong liberal. I remember the first time we sat and talked. He said about our orphan care work, he said, \u201CI never knew anything that good would come out of Focus on the Family.\u201D What you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re committed to completely eliminating those waiting lists, right, or for foster care. Well, that would be a goal. Or is that something else? Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s one of our goals. It\u2019s really practical. In Colorado, we began working on, I think, we had 850 kids in the foster care system available for adoption. If you know church history, that is one of the things the early church engaged. We were known for taking care of the orphan, and it\u2019s in part what the early church was built upon. And so for us in this country, with all that we have, particularly the Christian community, to be able to engage that, so over a couple of years, we were able to get that number down from 850 kids waiting to about 300. That was the most progress that had been made on that issue in the state for a long time. So that\u2019s why John wanted to meet with me and that\u2019s why he said, \u201CI didn\u2019t know anything that good would come out of Focus.\u201D So John, it just evolved into a wonderful relationship and I remember what he said to me. He said, \u201CFor 17 years, we\u2019ve been carpet bombing you. We\u2019re going to wipe the slate clean and start writing more favorable articles.\u201D So I was thankful he finally admitted that. So here\u2019s what he wrote. He wrote, \u201CHere\u2019s something you need to know.\u201D This is to his readers. \u201CThe Independent is involved in a community-based partnership with Focus. No, Hell has not frozen over. Here is what happened. Our publisher, John Weiss, realized that there was at least one issue on which Focus and the Indy can agree. We want all kids to grow up in a loving home.\u201D Yeah, and I appreciate John. I think John\u2019s got a great heart, and once again it\u2019s that example where we can come together. And, with the recent fires we had this summer in Colorado, 347 homes burnt down, we were able to call John and say, \u201CWould you like to co-sponsor an event.\u201D And I think that event in total raised about a million dollars for those victims. But the news of it was Focus on the Family and the Independentworking together. Right. So, you know, I think we can do some things to come together. That\u2019s the point. I\u2019ll just jump in here. I mean, I think to the point of these conversations we\u2019re having tonight \u2014 and I commend you, your team, for hosting it \u2014 this is how we break down the problems I think we\u2019re all feeling and experiencing is when we disagree with people who recognize that labels are not an appropriate way to try to identify people, that we need to come together, meet face to face, talk to those who have a challenge with us, try to hear one another out. It\u2019s amazing once you just sit down for five minutes how much you really do find common ground, find that the person you had perceived to be a certain way was not. And I think you\u2019re speaking to the fear-based mentality that drives not just Christians, but a lot of our culture. Politicians use it, media uses it, it\u2019s entertaining, but we really try to stir up fear and we try to make people afraid of an imagined future that really isn\u2019t true that nobody\u2019s really pursuing and we do it because it\u2019s good ratings, it raises money, it engenders a spirit behind you and the momentum behind a crowd to be behind you and for you. And I think that slowly we\u2019re going to have to break that down and it\u2019s going to take more conversations like this, but examples like I think what Jim described to John. You know, Gabe, I want to talk about some of the interesting ways you have talked about another one of these hot button issues, which is gay marriage. You know, you talk about internal discussions among younger evangelicals, that the question gets framed like this, how to remain biblically faithful yet credible in a post-Christian culture. How can Christians who care deeply about traditional marriage \u2014 and would you describe yourself that way \u2014 move forward in this new era? And so you lay that out there and you also said this pretty provocative thing. If a recent New York law \u2014 this was, I don\u2019t know, 2011 \u2014 becomes the impetus for Christians to stop reacting and start leading in these ways and these ways was really working on what you say, what we can control, the health of heterosexual marriage, of families, of creating community for marriages in trouble, of supporting healthy sexuality. You said, \u201CIf this kind of law becomes the impetus for Christians to start leading in these ways, it may be the best thing that\u2019s happened to traditional marriage in more than a generation.\u201D Yeah. I mean, I think we all have obviously heard so many conversations about marriage and it\u2019s constantly framed as this debate about gay marriage. We have to look back to our own marriages, to our own communities, to our own faith communities, and say what are we doing about marriage amongst ourselves? You know, I\u2019m encouraged to think about pastors I\u2019m talking to now who are thinking about how do we raise the level of commitment in our marriage and have more covenant marriages taking place within our communities where it goes beyond even what the state might require, but that challenges couples to commit, to not doing a no-fault divorce, to seeking two years\u2019 worth of counseling before they would get a divorce, and to do things where the Christian energy is propelled forward in making our own marriages healthier, requiring people that are going to be a part of a church to once a year participate in some kind of a marriage retreat? I mean, little practical steps that we can be taking that puts the emphasis back on our own marriages and back on families, I think, is critical. You know, I think a lot about a conversation I had with \u2014 he\u2019s actually a global conflict resolution. He\u2019s a mediator. He\u2019s Mennonite, which they have this great tradition of peacemaking. He talked about how we tend these days to think about social change coming in terms of mass movements, but in fact, he said movements, critical mass, often helps societies move beyond some injustice, but it doesn\u2019t point the way forward. And that where transformative change happens that really changes the way people live and makes that conflict unimaginable in the future, it\u2019s not critical mass, but critical yeast and it\u2019s about unlikely groups of people coming together. You both in your books, both of you tell stories of pivotal encounters you\u2019ve had and I think they both are in this category of unlikely encounters, but you really describe them as spiritual high points with people who I think outsiders would not associate your movement with embracing. And Jim, the story that you tell in your new book is with a prominent gay activist. You don\u2019t name this person. Unnamed. Unnamed, that\u2019s right, unnamed. On purpose. Yeah, you know, for months actually, this gentleman\u2019s name was on my heart and I kept moving his phone number around my desk, a bit embarrassing. We have a woman that comes in to clean the offices, and she kept moving the number next to my phone. And I took that as a sign. But I ended up talking and agreeing that we\u2019d meet at Starbucks. No note takers, just the two of us. And it was profound. I mean, again, to Gabe\u2019s point, when you can sit down and actually just be human with each other and talk, it\u2019s amazing what comes out of that. And, you know, we talked about the differences and they\u2019re plenty and we all know them. But at the end, I remember I just said to him, I said, \u201CI think the reason I felt compelled to call you and meet with you is just to let you know I know God loves you as much as he loves me.\u201D And he started to cry. Then I said, what do I do now? But it was human. There was \u2014 he told me a beautiful story about being raised in a Catholic family and his dad being 85 going to Mass every day. Two weeks prior to our meeting, he was with his dad and the priest was preaching against homosexuality, and his dad just reached over and took his hand and said, \u201CI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with me today.\u201D And I started to cry because it\u2019s just the love of a father\u2019s heart. To me, that\u2019s the picture of God. God is in our corner, no matter what is going on in our lives, whether you\u2019re straight, gay, whatever. That was just one of the high points. But I do remember coming back to Focus and I had a colleague who stopped me and said, \u201CHow could you meet with that man? That\u2019ll be an embarrassment.\u201D I got to tell you, that was one of the low points of my time at Focus. And I think that in a nutshell describes what Gabe and I are talking about. If you don\u2019t have a heart for people, then you don\u2019t have the heart of God. And that encounter didn\u2019t bring either one of you to a different place on the issue? No, no. That\u2019s a big issue. You don\u2019t want me to go further, do you? But, you know, we\u2019re so results-oriented in this culture, right? Aren\u2019t we? And I think there is a result clearly, but how do you talk about this? Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s difficult. This is probably one of the most difficult topics in the culture today. It is very volatile. We just believe \u2014 and it\u2019s very simple \u2014 that family, that the design \u2014 God\u2019s design in human sexuality is male and female and that we will do harm \u2014 and I know that many in this room is \u201CCan you being say that?\u201D \u2014 but we think there\u2019s harm in opening that Pandora\u2019s Box. We know it exists. I think there\u2019s less energy about same-sex marriage today within the Christian community, certainly under 35: 65 percent of those under 35 in the Christian community will support same-sex marriage. If that is not change, then that debate\u2019s pretty much over. But as we move forward, how can we address these issues in a way that\u2019s constructive, that\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s not mean-spirited? I\u2019ll tell you, there is an apology in this because I believe that the Christian community has not handled this well. There\u2019s a video on YouTube. It\u2019s a little boy in a church \u2014 and this angers me, to be quite honest. This little four- or five-year-old boy is singing a song in church, which is Romans 1:26, 27, \u201CAin\u2019t No Homo Gonna Get Into Heaven.\u201D The pastor on the platform is going, \u201CYeah, boy!\u201D That\u2019s the problem, that\u2019s the problem. That is not the God that Gabe and I know. And somehow we have got to address that. You can watch, listen and download this conversation between Focus on the Family\u2019s Jim Daly and Q founder Gabe Lyons. That\u2019s at onbeing.org/ccp. This is the first of four Civil Conversations we\u2019re holding to speak to deep divides in American life, which only become more polarizing in an election season. A great group of policy centers are joining us: the Humphrey School of Public Affairs, the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics, and the Brookings Institution. Learn more and please add your voice, your questions, and your ideas. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org/CCP. On Twitter, use hashtag CCP2012. and I\u2019m on Twitter now too: @kristatippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, \u201CThe Next Christians.\u201D I\u2019m with two leaders in an undertold story of our time \u2014 the evolution of young and conservative Christians working for common good beyond politics and polarization. Focus on the Family president Jim Daly is less high profile \u2014 and less of a lightening rod \u2014 than his predecessor James Dobson. Gabe Lyons is a 30-something thought leader and activist. He\u2019s the founder of Q, a learning network and TED-like annual gathering that exposes young Christians to cutting edges of culture. Gabe, there\u2019s this line, you wrote: \u201CThe longer I live, the more I am inspired by the life of Jesus, the way he sat down with people who were unlike Him.\u201D So, Gabe, your experience of sticking your neck out and also taking some heat for it was inviting Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf to a Q gathering where you interviewed him. That was around the time when the Islamic Cultural Center in Lower Manhattan was a really big heated issue. Tell me about that. Again, do you describe yourself as evangelical? I don\u2019t really use that word. I\u2019m definitely positioned that way. That\u2019s how media would describe me because of how I grew up and what I believe. I just don\u2019t find those terms helpful. I find most people don\u2019t even know what that means or the perception that they have of it certainly doesn\u2019t identify with who I am. I tend to think of myself as a Christian, somebody who\u2019s trying to follow Jesus and not attach too many more labels to it. OK. So I think that even for Q, that felt risky to people. Yeah. Well, I think partly, you know, the media climate was certainly heated around that moment. And what was important, again, with Q is we want to engage ideas and questions and we want Christian leaders to understand better how to engage with our neighbors. I mean, this is the principal point of what Jesus tells us matters most next to loving him is to love our neighbor. So it was important for me. I live in Lower Manhattan now and to be able to have a conversation with a neighbor that people actually really hated, I mean, a lot of Americans just thought that this cultural center, as he would describe it, should not exist and that it was something that our laws and Constitution basically should stamp out. And yet we all know and we understand religious liberty, that there\u2019s really no case for that legally. And so I wanted to have a conversation with a Muslim to say, \u201CLet\u2019s hear your views. I want you to sit in front of 700 Christian leaders and I want a dialogue and I want to better understand what you not just were proposing for this cultural center, but more your views on this relationship between Muslims and Christians because over 2,000 years it\u2019s been pretty bad, and as we look forward in our culture today, it\u2019s likely headed towards a really bad place.\u201D Right, and tell me what was so meaningful for you about that experience. Well, for me, it was a friendship beginning. I mean, personally for me. I mean, I literally was with him yesterday and we were continuing our ongoing conversation about finding common ground and finding ways where, as he would put it, moderate voices within Islam are not heard. They\u2019re drowned out by extremists and it\u2019s not just in the Islamic world. It\u2019s in the Christian world, that the extremists get the airtime and they\u2019re the ones that will fight harder for their position, whereas the moderates have a really hard time getting airtime. So part of our relationship, he\u2019s introducing me to younger Muslims in New York that I can get to know, where our friendships can start to flourish in a city where I think in many cases it\u2019s gotten beyond, maybe in some context in American culture, it\u2019s not where New York is. I mean, a lot of New Yorkers have good relationships with people of multiple faiths. I found as a Christian in New York, I can talk about my faith more openly than I could in Atlanta, Georgia, which might be shocking. But people are more open-minded, they want to hear your story. There\u2019s opportunities to dialogue with respect because so many people are different. You can\u2019t exist without that, and I think there\u2019s something we all can learn from that experience. Are we ready to do some questions? OK. I\u2019m going to invite Larry Jacobs to the microphone. We\u2019ve got some great questions here both from online, from folks in the audience. We hear of the weaknesses of the American evangelical movement. What are the strengths? I appreciate that. I think, you know, we at Focus on the Family, we see that. For example, we know divorce happens. I was with a Supreme Court justice, not one that you would probably associate with Focus on the Family, but we were talking about poverty and I said to this Supreme Court justice, \u201CDo you know the interesting thing for Focus, the number one predictor of poverty is divorce? A woman and her children will fall below the poverty line after divorce.\u201D So in essence, at Focus as we try to keep families together, we\u2019re fighting the number one contributor to poverty. And I\u2019ll never forget. He sat back and said, \u201CI\u2019d never thought of it that way.\u201D That\u2019s important. Family is important and I guess it breaks my heart that we\u2019ve kind of accepted the fragmentation of family and we\u2019ve got to do all we can to maintain healthy family structure because it\u2019s what will stabilize the culture. And social science is right there in agreement with that. So that\u2019s where you find common grace, common ground, where you can work together to that end. The other positives, I mean, I would just say and add to that, compassion clearly which aligns with that, but especially in the next generation, a real sense of volunteerism, desire to not just talk about faith, but to roll up their sleeves and go to work on it in their communities. Maybe they\u2019d get criticized in some cases for not being as evangelistic, so maybe not proclaiming why they\u2019re doing it or asking a bunch of people to commit to Christ as they\u2019re doing it, but they\u2019ve moved beyond that to just say, \u201CLook, part of what I have to do is make sure my actions show what I believe versus just my words.\u201D I would say Christians are, you know, the some of the most generous people in terms of giving and giving when our country\u2019s in calamity and crisis. I think of Tad Agoglia who runs something called First Response, motivated by his faith. And he\u2019s the first to show up after a tornado with all the heavy equipment, going into that community, working to get peoples\u2019 lights and power back on, but then working to make sure they have water. I mean, on and on. I think these are some of the stories over the last decade we\u2019re seeing as Christians tend to be some of the first to show up with their wallet and with their time when our communities are in crisis. I hope over the next decade that continues in our economic situation as the church probably becomes even more critical to trying to supply for those who need it. I believe that was true in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina as well. It was the Christians who were there and who stayed. Exactly right. Mm-hmm. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being. Today, \u201CThe Next Christians.\u201D I\u2019m in a public discussion with Focus on the Family president Jim Daly and Q founder Gabe Lyons. You\u2019ve talked about politics not being the dominant thrust of your organizations and your efforts. But when you do think about politics, are there ways in which the political involvement goes beyond party and the partisan polarization? For instance, the evangelical movement\u2019s been associated with conservative social issues. Are there conversations about supporting, for instance, higher taxes to show mercy for the poor, the ill needing health care and for single mothers heading homes? I\u2019ll give you one example. One for me was the White House. President Obama invited me to come and talk about the issue of fatherlessness. He held a Town Hall meeting basically. And I had to really think about that because, OK, does this provide political fodder? But, you know, I came down to the conclusion that, with this president, he didn\u2019t have a dad just like me and he has a concern about fatherlessness. And if I can\u2019t go to that meeting and participate, I lack integrity. That\u2019s the bottom line. I do think on the taxation issue, the church \u2014 it\u2019s interesting because I think the church, when we tax and redistribute wealth for the purpose of taking care of the poor, the church always saw that as its responsibility. I don\u2019t think it did a very good job taking care of the poor, unfortunately, especially in these most recent years. So, but I would think that we need to rethink that. A lot of state budgets are going bankrupt. We had a situation in Colorado where the school lunch program was running out of money. And it actually was humorous because Gary and I talked about it and we thought, well, the budget wasn\u2019t huge to finish the years, like $160,000. I said, \u201CLet\u2019s cover it.\u201D It created turmoil in the state capital because we can\u2019t let Focus do that. Was politically charged? So the Republicans said, \u201CHey, why not? Private sector probably could do something\u201D and the Democrats in the State House said, \u201CNo, no, no, we don\u2019t want religious or nonprofit organizations doing that,\u201D which is unfortunate because, like orphan and foster care 80 years ago was taken care of by the church with all its mess. I get that. But the state took that over about 80 years ago and guess what? There\u2019s a lot of mess. So I think as states become more strapped for dollars, it\u2019s a great opportunity for the church to once again draw close to its core call and do some of these things. Yeah, and I found \u2014 we just did our most recent Q gathering in Washington kind of for the point of saying, look, we need to realize that the way we get along isn\u2019t by being just one party or the other, but through relationships. So we had multiple presenters that represented different views participate in our gathering and share with us their points of view and lots of conversations happening all over D.C. from the State Department to the White House on and on where Christians were saying, \u201CI want to roll up our sleeves and get engaged in the issues I care about,\u201D whether that\u2019s the environment and getting better educated on that or a movement like human trafficking where the Christian Church has been behind that for the last seven years really driving that and it\u2019s become such a forefront social issue. It does remind me of what the church ought to be like. Not that we\u2019re trying to represent one party or the other or be seen as a voting block that can be won by one party or the other, but I\u2019m encouraged that today evangelicals aren\u2019t seen that way. I mean, I would say in the last two elections, you\u2019ve seen that completely change. The evangelicals, you know, we don\u2019t even have a candidate in the race right now, so it\u2019s not something that\u2019s just going to be won that easily. There\u2019s hardly a Protestant in the race. There actually is one. There is one. It\u2019s President Obama. Yeah. Just to add to what Gabe has said there, the interesting thing with this is there\u2019s two terms in the church lexicon. One is orthodoxy, the truth of God\u2019s word, and then orthopraxy, the doing of the word. And I think one of the problems we\u2019re facing now is that, for many years and it\u2019s really played out in the political arena, the drive for orthodoxy. We need to maintain orthodoxy, and I think we have lost our way and I\u2019m so excited about Gabe and the younger generation because I think what God is doing through them and the vision and the heart and the passion is to revive orthopraxy, the doing of the word. And, you know, orthodoxy should be the foundation of the building. You don\u2019t really see it, you know it\u2019s there and you\u2019re glad it\u2019s there because it keeps the building up, but the building is actually the orthopraxy, the things that we\u2019ve talked about: taking care of the poor, being engaged, talking life, talking about the right things and doing the right things. I want to close by circling back to the word \u201Cfear.\u201D I think, Jim, you used that word early on. Because it\u2019s so clear, when we can be clear-eyed and calm about these things, that behind our attacks on each other, that fear looks like anger and fear looks like violence. And you talked about a lot of Christians being fearful and not necessarily even fearful. There are a lot of specific things to be fearful about and then there\u2019s the fact that we live in this moment of huge change. I mean, if you took technology alone, but it\u2019s bigger than that. And as human beings, one of the things we\u2019re learning from science, change is stressful and it sends us back to our lizard brains, right? So there\u2019s some aspect of all of this incivility, which is not a big enough word for what we\u2019re talking about, that is just about being human. And I wonder if the two of you would think about people in this room, people who are listening, you know, what can anybody here do to calm that fear of people who are different from them and so make new relationships? You know, make kindness more possible on both sides. Mm. Well, I think it starts with addressing the fear and trying to understand in our own life where\u2019s that fear coming from? What am I really afraid of? Likely what you\u2019re afraid of doesn\u2019t exist in just another person. It\u2019s some idea. It\u2019s some imagination you\u2019ve been taught. It\u2019s some way you\u2019re seeing the world that\u2019s driving this anxiety about what could happen or why somebody disagrees with you and why that\u2019s so bad for the world. And we have to work through that and then decide to engage with people. And I \u2014 and I \u2014 to me, a first step is engaging with somebody who you think you disagree with or you maybe like but maybe you\u2019ve never had a conversation with because you think you guys just don\u2019t get along or they look different than you or you prejudge them in some ways that I used to do when I was a Christian who thought anybody who looked different than me was not believing the right things. And I think when we reach out and just start to engage and have conversations with people, we find on the human level people want community, especially in this technology-saturated world. People want eye-to-eye contact, human-to-human relationships, and I think that\u2019s one of the call as Christians. I mean, we have a story that\u2019s essentially the story that we believe, is God sends Jesus to be fully embodied in a human culture to give people a new experience that was very different than what they had seen the religious leaders represent to them. And \u2014 and Jesus has to come fully embodied to do that. And it\u2019s our call, today, one of the most counter-cultural things we can do, but refreshing things we can do is to be fully present, fully embodied, with other human beings and listen to them, look them in the eyes, ask them how they\u2019re doing, have these conversations not just with strangers, but with your parents, with your children, with your spouse. We need it and it\u2019s something desperately missing in our society. And if we don\u2019t work on that \u2014 being human, having conversations \u2014 I think 10 to 20 years from now, we\u2019re going to see incredible suffering in our world as a result. I would only add, you know, the Scripture is pretty clear. The Lord says, \u201CI do not give you a spirit of fear.\u201D It\u2019s pretty straightforward. And for us to run around fearful is the antithesis of what God\u2019s character is. So it\u2019s very easy for me in the Book of Galatians, the fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, longsuffering. Then you look at the other part of Galatians, the ugly fruit \u2014 jealousy, strife, envy, anger. If you\u2019re seeing that fruit, you\u2019re not seeing God\u2019s heart. So it doesn\u2019t mean we live that perfectly. I think sometimes the non-Christian community, if we become human and we can\u2019t live perfectly, they point that out, so you\u2019re a hypocrite. Well, no, we\u2019re not Jesus. You can\u2019t live it perfectly every day. And my point there is simply to say that that\u2019s common grace. We are striving to do these things, to live by the spirit of God. Sometimes we fall short, and we need to be accountable to each other in that context. You know, I didn\u2019t set this up as \u2014 it\u2019s not like the two of you are on opposing sides of something, but you represent nuance and diversity within a large sector. So I wonder if you could just say a little bit in closing, you know, what you\u2019ve learned from each other. Well, Gabe? Well, I\u2019ll go first because it\u2019ll be easier. No, I think, again, what I see in Gabe and Lou Giglio and Brad Lomenick and others that have really gone out on a limb, they have led the way. And it\u2019s important for older Christians at 51 [laugh] \u2026 You are not old. \u2026 to say, you know, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m learning a lot from them in terms of that orthopraxy, courage to line themselves up with Scripture and go for it and take the knives both in the back and in the chest both from those that oppose you and your friends. I\u2019ve seen that with Gabe, you know, when he was talking to religious leaders. And it\u2019s refreshing. And I think when people and the older Christian leaderships says, \u201CWhere are those future leaders? They\u2019re just not there,\u201D because they want gladiators. They want culture warriors and the amazing thing is I think God is answering their question and they don\u2019t even see it. That\u2019s very kind of you, Jim. And I think what I\u2019ve learned from Jim is the courage it takes to stay with an institution that he could never talk about it like this, but in my opinion, Focus on the Family did represent so much of what was wrong with Christian life in American culture. Brand-wise, I think we all recognized the brand that it had as you read, you know, kind of this religious right powerhouse. And for Jim to be able to go into that environment and be faithful, into an institution, not just go start something new. It\u2019s easy for me. I went to just start something new, but Jim went in and has been a part of reforming really an institution \u2014 which is a much harder thing to do \u2014 and has stuck with it, I know, through probably really tough conversations and people who have probably left supporting Focus on the Family or have given up on more focuses because it\u2019s not carrying that gladiator mindset. But they\u2019re actually getting back to what the big critique was, if you recall over the last decade ago, as why don\u2019t you just focus on your own d-a-m-n family, right? That was a bumper sticker. It was? Big John Weiss did that bumper sticker. I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m serious. I feel like Jim has done that and he\u2019s doing that, and it\u2019s giving Focus on the Family in many ways a new life and a new generation that\u2019s moved beyond its founder. It gives me great hope that institutions can continue to grow, continue to transform with the times, with the moment, and we need Focus on the Family. I know in my own family my kids listen to \u201CAdventures in Odyssey,\u201D this resource that Focus on the Family has put out for years helping children understand character qualities and values. I mean, these are the kind of things that families need and they might not want to admit it, but anybody who is a parent and has kids and they\u2019re trying to figure this out, knows they need these kind of resources. So it\u2019s big gift not just to the body of Christ and to the Church, but I think to our culture at large. Well, I think this is a fine beginning to this Civil Conversations Project and I want to thank all of you for coming and everybody out there listening, and so much gratitude to Jim Daly and Gabe Lyons. Well, thank you, Krista. Thank you, Krista. Jim Daly is president of Focus on the Family. He\u2019s the author of the new book Refocus: Living a Life that Reflects God\u2019s Heart. Gabe Lyons is founder of Q. His books include UnChristian: What a New Generation Really Thinks about Christianity\u2026 and Why It Matters and The Next Christians: Seven Ways You Can Live the Gospel and Restore the World. Watch my entire public discussion with Jim Daly and Gabe Lyons at onbeing.org. It included more audience questions and other topics, including Jim Daly\u2019s framing of immigration as a family values issue. The next event in our Civil Conversations Project is Wednesday September 26th: \u201CPro-Life, Pro-Choice, Pro-Dialogue.\u201D We\u2019ll be with activists who are forming real relationship with their political opposites. And we want you to be involved, join us online and watch our live video stream at onbeing.org/CCP. We\u2019ll also be live-tweeting this public discussion, follow us @Beingtweets and I tweet with the handle @KristaTippett. Special thanks this week to Larry Jacobs, Kate Cimino, and their colleagues at the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs."
