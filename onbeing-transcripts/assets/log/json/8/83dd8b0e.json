  "fullText": "You want to know what my real charge to people is? My real charge to people is look around and see who\u2019s missing. And try to invite that person. In any given moment\u2026 In any\u2026 \u2026in any given situation. Look around. Who\u2019s not here? Who\u2019s not here? Who\u2019s not here? So there\u2019s all this, like, I\u2019m sad that this is this way. OK. What is the one thing you could do to fix it? Go do that thing. Just go do that thing, you know? If journalism is a primary way we tell the story of ourselves and our time, Michel Martin is a person helping us tell that story and shape it more completely. Her daily NPR program Tell Me More was often labeled as a \u201Cdiversity\u201D or \u201Cminority\u201D show. But in fact, she and her journalism are about a more generous and realistic sweep of who we are now \u2014 and how we\u2019re creating our life together anew. In this third episode in our American Consciousness series, we mine her wisdom on the emerging fabric of human identity. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I spoke with Michel Martin in a week of live conversations as part of the 2014 season at the Chautauqua Institution. We were in the outdoor Hall of Philosophy. So, this is the day that I get to indulge in drawing out a contemporary, and a comrade, and an esteemed colleague in my field. Michel Martin. And we\u2019re going to talk about the shifting American consciousness, as it pertains to our world of journalism. And also about the wisdom she\u2019s gained, um, about the world through her life, and her work in this field. Although we did just set the ground rules that I\u2019m \u2014 this is my interview and I\u2019m in charge here. If she gets out of control, I\u2019m going to call her on it. Um, Michel Martin has spent more than 25 years as a journalist. She\u2019s worked in print, on television, and now in radio. She\u2019s covered state and local politics for The Washington Post, the US Embassy bombings in Africa for \u201CNightline,\u201D and she\u2019s been the White House Correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Michel Martin studied sociology at Radcliffe College, at Harvard University, and has also done graduate work at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. She joined National Public Radio in 2006 as the creator and host of Tell Me More, which broadcast it\u2019s last show on August 1, 2014. And we\u2019ll talk about that in a moment. So, did you spend your whole childhood in Brooklyn? I did. OK. I did. My father was a firefighter. Your father was a firefighter. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. OK, we are a family of people who respond to bells ringing. My, uh, my aunt is a police officer. She was one of the first black women to become a detective in the New York City Police Department. My uncles \u2014 two of my uncles were cops. Whenever I get called for jury duty, I\u2019m up there for a very long time. And, was there a, um, religious spiritual background to your childhood? You know, \u00A0I\u2019ve heard people use the phrase, uh, culturally Jewish, not religious. So, I would say, culturally Christian, but not disciplined. Um, in the sense, I think it was really more of a function of the kind of the chaos of the way we were raised. Uh, we were church-goers periodically, like we were a lot of things periodically. And it really wasn\u2019t until I became an adult that I started seeking kind of a specific, uh, discipline, um, a specific frame for those ideas. I went to an Episcopal high school. I went to St. Paul\u2019s School, um, so I think, you know, I would say, culturally Christian, in the way that so many of us are. Particularly those of us who are African-American, you know, you are kind of steeped in the story. It\u2019s fundamental to you, even if you don\u2019t have a particular label to place on it at any given time. Yes. Um, well, let me say \u2014 I want to talk about journalism. Sure. And also, I\u2019m just going to note here that it\u2019s rare to be \u2014 we\u2019re two of the very few women hosts in public radio. So here we are. Yeah. And we get to have a conversation with each other. Um, it \u2014 what \u2014 how did you first get into journalism? What drew you? Interestingly enough, it was that, um, in college. Because I think like a lot of people of my era, we all assumed we were going to law school, whether we wanted to go or not. And, you know, for some \u2014 I don\u2019t know how that happened that we were all supposed to go to law school. Yeah, what year were you born? Can you\u2026 Um, \u201959. \u201959. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We were all supposed to go. Yeah. That\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know why we were all supposed to go, but we were all supposed to go. And I started writing for The Harvard Crimson, and I was just \u2014 I just fell in love with it. And it was \u2014 at the time, there was a series of assaults on young black girls in the Allston, you know, Brighton neighborhood and in Roxbury. And it was somebody, like a serial sort of predator preying on these girls. And I was never reading about it in the paper. And I just thought that was crazy. And you know how the arrogance of your youth, you think well, I\u2019ll fix this. You know. Yeah. And I wrote my little story for The Harvard Crimson, and you know, and it was fascinating \u2014 it was just all those things opened up at once for me. Like, for example, I called the Boston Police Department to ask for a comment about this series of assaults, and I\u2019m quoting accurately. When I called up and I said I\u2019d like to have a comment from you, he said, \u201CWhat am I talking to?\u201D And I said, \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D \u201CWhat am I talking to: black or white?\u201D Really? So, you know, I said, well, I\u2019m black, does it matter? And he said yes it does. And I don\u2019t remember anything after that. I don\u2019t remember anything about what his comment was after that. But just to give you a sense of what the environment was at the time, where people felt like they could just tell you \u2014 ask you, you know, to your face, like what \u2014 or over the phone. And, I just think that once I kind of did my piece for The Crimson and I had people stopping me and saying, I didn\u2019t know about that. And I think I got hooked on that. I got hooked on the, I didn\u2019t know about that. Yeah. So for me, that was the driver, was telling people something that they didn\u2019t already know. And, you know, so there it is. And so, mm-hmm. OK, so I also \u2014 I mean, I was born in 1960, and I also got into print initially. And, you know, when I went to college, I started reading The New York Times religiously. And, um, I\u2019m sure you feel this way, too. We would never have imagined back then that in our lifetimes we would see the decline of newspapers. Um\u2026 No. Growing up in New York, which is\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s incredible. \u2026three-newspaper town, I mean\u2026 Yeah. \u2026my parents had three newspapers in the house always. It never would have occurred to me, no. And it is shocking, and it\u2019s still shocking to me, but, I also, just in the last few years, realized how incredible it is that, let\u2019s say those of us who love The New York Times, every morning we read this thing that at the top said, \u201CAll the news that\u2019s fit to print.\u201D How absurd. You know, but, I mean, what you\u2019re pointing out is it wasn\u2019t true, it was never true. And there\u2019s so many things that we can bemoan about the loss of newspapers as we\u2019ve known them, but that awareness that there\u2019s so much more story and reality is essential. I mean, that\u2019s what you were seeing. Well, I have very \u2014 as you would imagine, I have mixed feelings as I\u2019m sure you do, too. I mean, the decline of the big newspaper is similar to like the decline of the department store. Yeah. where you could find\u2026 Yeah. \u2026a, you know, a little bit of a lot of things, let\u2019s say. And now it\u2019s boutiques, and everybody\u2019s, you know, people are too cool to go to a department store, \u2018cause they want to go to this boutique that nobody knows about but them. But the problem is that there is no gathering place for us all to find out things that we all would benefit from knowing, really. And\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that\u2019s the \u2014 that is the tension for me. And don\u2019t you think that\u2019s what we have to create now somehow? I mean, that\u2019s the next innovation. We have to try. But we have to want to. I mean, on the one hand, I am very interested in, I think, my work has been of attention of on the one hand, validating the experiences of people who are not always heard from, and letting them know they\u2019re not crazy, but also connecting people who otherwise do not meet. I mean, I think that\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 shall we? That\u2019s ambiance. I don\u2019t\u2026 So I think both and, the question then becomes, I mean, I remember when I was working in New York. I worked in New York, I was, uh, I worked in a television \u2014 well, I worked at ABC for what, like 13 years or something like that, and I was working on a program there, and I would go up to New York quite often to film the, you know, interstitial segments, right? The studio segments were all filmed in New York. And I remember going to get my hair cut once at this place in, uh, very nice salon that geared toward women of color, African-American woman. And the girl who was washing my hair said, \u201CWell, let me know when you have the black segments on, because that\u2019s \u2014 those are the only ones I\u2019m interested in.\u201D Mm-hmm. I remember this, you know, this kind of swoony feeling coming over me, like, oh, God, I\u2019m just trying to get my hair cut, but now I have to educate this girl about why she\u2019s wrong. You know, and, uh, and I was trying to kind of sort of gently suggest to her that that\u2019s just not right. You know, you can\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 you just can\u2019t live in your bubble and not come out of it. Yeah. Yeah, and\u2026 And we\u2019re choosing that. We\u2019re validating that by our choices. And so the question then becomes is how do we persuade people to come out of their bubble. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in a live conversation with journalist Michel Martin. We\u2019re in the outdoor hall of philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York \u2014 in a week devoted to exploring the \u201CAmerican Consciousness\u201D. We spoke shortly after Tell Me More, the NPR program she created and hosted for seven years, broadcast its last show. You know, one thing that disturbed me as I was getting ready to interview you and, you know, just steeping myself in the show, and then things written about the show. And even in the way NPR describes the show \u2014 or it\u2019d be described as an NPR program aimed at minorities. And, you know, I think what you do in your journalism on NPR is you \u2014 \u00A0and I really think you\u2019ve followed that thread that you pulled out those years ago, that you want to tell more of the story. So, it\u2019s not at all that you don\u2019t have mainstream white voices or, you know, some of the same kinds of intellectuals who are other programs, but you bring an array of voices in that reflect the array of who we are. And there seems to be something really troubling at the idea that because you know you are an African-American woman, and I think that\u2019s the inference that\u2019s being drawn, you know, that it\u2019s a program aimed at minorities, but whereas a \u2014 so many of the programs, and let\u2019s just say on public radio in particular, which are hosted by white men, are for everybody. Well, I \u2014 no, I agree with you. I find that very annoying. Like, how is it that, you know, white people are universal\u2026 Yeah. \u2026but the rest of us are not. Like it\u2019s like, you know, white people get to be universal peanut butter, but we\u2019re always the crunchy. You know, I mean, what is that? You know, why is that? I feel like I\u2019m very mainstream. I had a woman once complain about the music on the program and she said it was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what she said, it was something insulting. I don\u2019t remember. But it was something about the music on the program, about how it wasn\u2019t, you know, mainstream enough or something of that sort. I said, I started laughing. I said, lady. I went to Harvard. My husband\u2019s on the symphony board. I don\u2019t know how much more mainstream you want to get. You know, \u00A0what does that mean? That is \u2014 that\u2019s privilege, isn\u2019t it? You get to universalize yourself and decide that you\u2019re everybody, and these other people are different. That\u2019s privilege. Um, I think that what I tried to do is just exactly\u2026 \u2026well, thank you. I mean, what I try to do is exactly what you said, is kind of pick up the loose ball. What\u2019s the side of the story that isn\u2019t obvious? Like, for example, during the beginning of the, you know, conflict between, you know, Ukraine and Russia, we had a Russian Orthodox priest, and a Ukrainian Orthodox priest in the studio and I said to them, what\u2019s your job at a time like this? How \u2014 who are you in this? Yeah. And one of the things that they both pointed out was how much intermarriage there is between Ukrainians and Russians. In fact, the Russian Orthodox priest was married to a woman of Ukrainian heritage. And realizing that\u2019s what happens on borders, right? And that was the first I had heard of that, or even thought about that. And so was that for minorities? But I dunno \u2014 look, it\u2019s our broader discomfort with race. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2014 was it Condoleezza Rice, called it our birth defect? It\u2019s that \u2014 which isn\u2019t to say that I feel defected, because I don\u2019t. But the circumstances by which people particularly of African descent, and also I would say by Asian descent who came here under circumstances which were different from people who came by choice, even if the choice was pressure, starvation, and, you know, poor economic conditions, who came here under duress, uh, is something that we have not really come to terms with in a way that we can commonly talk about. You know, when people say things like, I don\u2019t even see color, I don\u2019t see race. And I always want to go, what\u2019s wrong with it that we can\u2019t see it? Right. I like mine. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m \u2014 I like my color. I\u2019m fine with it. You can see it. I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 we don\u2019t say that about other groups, other things. Like, I remember, you know, we go to the beach in the summer on the Delaware shore, and there are a lot of people who put, you know, flags on their porches. And I see a lot of Irish \u2014 flags from the Irish, you know, the Irish Republic. I see a lot of flags from Italy. People are just declaring their heritage. And nobody says, I don\u2019t see that. Right. And \u00A0don\u2019t you think that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about our discomfort and it\u2019s also about something that\u2019s come up, you know, this week in the conversations here that, journalism \u2014 journalists \u2014 so let me just say, I think the context of this conversation is you and I are two people in the field\u2026 Yes. \u2026talking about how we\u2019re going to recreate, you know, how \u2014 the work we have to do. Um, because every \u2014 all of our institutions are being recreated and reinvented. The problem that, um, the same destructive, let\u2019s say, religious voices, or racial voices get so much airtime, you know, I mean, it came up in the context of this week at Chautauqua with Richard Rodriguez, you know, he was talking about where the Christians were, the churches when you have children in despair at the Mexican-American border. And I think that\u2019s a valid question to ask in our culture, but I also know, and I think you know, that there are a lot of Christians, and a lot of churches, and a lot of people of different faith out there, but the cameras get pointed at these ugly, terrified, hateful voices and people, and they get pointed at them over and over again. I agree with you. And I\u2019m always puzzled by that. I mean, I know that, you know, when my last show on August 1st, um, one of the people that I had on was a Rabbi in Washington, D.C. \u2014 Orthodox Rabbi in Washington, D.C. And obviously one of the reasons that we called him was to ask the same question, what\u2019s your job at a time like this? When there\u2019s so much going on, you know, in Gaza, in the Middle East. And, you know, part of what he said, and I\u2019m not going to quote him in a way that he deserves, was to say that part of my job is to speak to people\u2019s higher \u2014 a higher purpose at a time like this. And, part of the reason I felt it was my job to put on voices like that. I mean, one of the things he said to me is it\u2019s so much of the coverage of the religion is either infantile or incendiary. Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s either infantile in this kind of this \u2014 \u00A0forgive me local news, because I know that\u2019s an important and hard job, but it\u2019s either \u2014 isn\u2019t it interesting that those people do that? You know. Wow, look at their funny customs, you know. Right. The \u201Creligion is for weirdos\u201D, school of journalism. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s either that or\u2026 Yeah. They \u2014 they mean well, but it\u2019s still\u2026 Quaint. \u2026annoying. Yeah. And then \u2014 or, it\u2019s incendiary, people who are deliberately provocative, people who are burning Qur\u2019ans, people like that, who is \u2014 I mean, these people who are doing all this agitating in New York against the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, which, by the way, was nowhere near Ground Zero\u2026 Yeah. \u2026were people who were, you couldn\u2019t tell me right now what their job is, what they \u2014 what standing do they have, that would cause people to follow them? Other than that they\u2019re racist and loud. And so, you know, I don\u2019t know why that is. I confess to you. I have been in this business as \u2014 you and I have been in this business a long time, and I continue to be puzzled by why\u2026 Yeah, and I also\u2026 \u2026is that. It\u2019s appalling to me that journalists make mistakes and sloppy generalizations about religious people, and about religious tradition, that they would never let themselves make, or that some editor would correct them about if it were political or economic. That is true. And I \u2014 but I think it\u2019s in part because \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s in a way like similar to race in that people act as if they don\u2019t notice it, it somehow will go away. And I mean, this is where, you know, the whole question of, right, people saying I don\u2019t see race, I don\u2019t see color. It\u2019s a false doctrine of politeness. It \u2014 they mean well\u2026 Yeah. \u2026but it\u2019s actually \u2014 they\u2019re demeaning you, in a way that they don\u2019t mean to. There\u2019s this kind of a glossing over of difference. I mean, I agree \u2014 you know, I enjoyed your conversation with Richard Rodriguez, but I disagree with him on this whole question of diversity. He said diverse comes from divide. Well, we recognize the value of diversity in other spheres. I mean, biodiversity. We couldn\u2019t exist without biodiversity. I mean, those of you who are in the financial field, I\u2019m sure, have preached the doctrine of the diversity in portfolio. Yeah. Why then is it so shocking that diversity of opinion, background, is also important to the healthy functioning of societies? I don\u2019t\u2026 And I\u2026 \u2026understand why that\u2019s such a hard concept. Yeah. I, you know, I think what he was getting at is that\u2026 \u2026um, yeah, is that sometimes \u2014 that there\u2019s a flatness to the way we talk about celebrating diversity, which actually is about, you know, saying aren\u2019t we all wonderful and don\u2019t we have so much in common? And in fact, not getting at that richness and vividness and vitality of what makes us different. Well, I remember, when I was a White House correspondent, you know, back in the day, and we were, you know, first of all, I\u2019ll just apologize in advance, \u2018cause reporters have a sick sense of humor. That\u2019s just a fact. I\u2019m sorry. So, just letting you know in advance. And I remember we were flying over the Andes, and we were getting, you know, we were on our way to a Latin America swing. This was \u2014 I covered the George H. W. Bush, Bush 41, and I was in that press corps, and we were flying over the Andes, and we were having all kinds of turbulence. And so we were, you know, so reporters sick sense of humor, they were talking about if the plane crashed, who would get the headline. And, you know\u2026 \u2026it would be \u2014 we said, oh, no, Leslie Stahl was in that press corps. She\u2019s oh Leslie\u2019s going to get the headline. I wonder if I\u2019ll get a paragraph? And, all this. But when the conversation got off the kind of the sick side of it, we started thinking about our skill sets. And one of the reasons \u2014 one of the things we observed is that we had the skill sets to survive because some of us were \u2014 had been former Marines. Some of us \u2014 some of \u2014 particularly some of the videographers, some of our camera operators, were Marines. Former Marines and who had had survival training. And some of us had been trained in emergency medicine. Some of us \u2014 I guess what I\u2019m saying is, even this rarified group, the diversity of experience\u2026 Yeah. \u2026we realized would have helped us to survive. And that is how I would like us to think about this. Yeah. I would like us to think about the diversity of perspective and experience that\u2026 \u2026would help us to survive. And then the biodiversity context\u2026 Yeah. Yeah. Right. I wonder \u2014 so one of the things you\u2019ve done in your journalism at NPR and certainly on Tell Me More is to say that faith and family are huge topics at the center of your journalism. And I wonder, um, how you respond to the \u2014 because, you know, I think in journalism these are considered to be soft, and subjective, and\u2026 Girly. \u2026girl \u2014 well, girly, yeah, even that. Um, how do you respond to that? How do you think about that? Don\u2019t care. Brush it off, haters. Don\u2019t care. Take a hike, haters. Go. Don\u2019t care. I just think that these things are so fundamental to the way we live that they deserve the seriousness that we impart to other topics. Yeah. And part of what I am trying to do is \u2014 elevate is the wrong word, because they don\u2019t need my elevation. But to allow us to discuss these things in a way that allows my values to come to the fore, which are facts, first of all. I\u2019m in the fact-based side of journalism. Let me just put it this way. Yeah. The people who are enemies-driven, who look for their enemy, and then try to fire at that person, that is not me. And I hope that all of us here are lifting up the fact-based side of journalism. And so what I try to do is impart facts to things that we have opinions about. For example, I just did a book last week about, uh, a couple of weeks ago, about the long shadow, and a very deep study of the life chances and trajectories of a large group of children in Baltimore over 25 years, remarkable work. Half the subject sample black, half the subject sample white, and they destroy many of the myths that people have. The fact that, for example, that the white boys with a high school education only, far more likely to be employed than the black boys with a high school education only. Why is that? Their social networks. Their social networks allowed them to be employed. The fact that drug and alcohol use among the white kids was greater than that among the black kids, but it \u2014 drug and alcohol use had a far more deleterious impact on the employment opportunities for the black kids. So these are knowable facts. So even though I recognize after all these years in this business that a lot of people don\u2019t care what the facts are, I\u2019m hoping that other people do. My work is for them. And so it\u2019s knowable facts and also to help us talk to each other about experiences that could be helpful to each other. I mean, one of the reasons I got very interested in the parenting conversation, is that I look at all these parenting magazines, you know, when you\u2019re \u2014 when you\u2019ve got little kids, I don\u2019t know. If you \u2014 if you\u2019ve got little kids, you\u2019re like desperate for information about, but I found that so much of the conversation was how to get your kid to eat carrots. All right, well, once you\u2019ve gotten your kid to eat carrots, what else is there? Yeah, right. But\u2026 But I\u2026 Reams and reams of books and volumes on how to get them\u2026 It\u2019s all about the carrots. \u2026to sleep and how to get them to eat. Get the carrots. OK, now that we\u2019ve got the carrots together\u2026 Yeah. \u2026what happens when your kid goes out to the playing ground and somebody calls him the \u201Cn\u201D word? What are you going to do? What happens when you \u2014 your son is the only white boy on his basketball team? And you know, the kids on the other team are jealous because they want to play for that team because it\u2019s a good team, and they think he\u2019s taking their spot. And they rough him up in the locker room. What do you do? What do you do when your, um, you\u2019ve taught your children, use your words to diffuse conflict, and then you go to a sporting event and the other parents are, knock him down! Knock him down! And you\u2019re like, oh, wow. What do I do about \u2014 what? You know, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m interested in. And I didn\u2019t see a lot of that being discussed in these parenting magazines. So that\u2019s kind of what I wanted to talk about, the kinds of the things that I think a lot of people are talking about, but bring in voices that they might not have access to. Yeah. And, but the facts alone don\u2019t take us there, either, right? The parenting magazines need to think bigger, and so does journalism as a discipline. And I mean, I think, you know, what you do is you work with facts and you also bring, um, human voices of wisdom and experience, because that rounds out the facts, right? I mean, the facts don\u2019t tell us the whole truth. Well, I think in part what you and I do is in part offer people a way to talk to each other. Mm-hmm. That they might not have in their own lives. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I got letters from people who would say, I feel like I\u2019m kind of standing at the window listening to a conversation, and I want to join in, but I don\u2019t know how. And just as there are certain people telling us how to talk to each other, which is to basically yell at each other until the other person submits, I think part of what we\u2019re doing is showing people another way to talk to each other. And I\u2019m hoping that people will draw inspiration and courage from that. If I \u2014 I hope I\u2019m not being too grand, but I\u2019m hoping what they will do is say to themselves, I can do that, too. Because I\u2019m sorry, I mean, I, you know, I love you to death, but this is not rocket science, what we\u2019re doing here. I mean, I love it\u2026 I know. I know. \u2026but we\u2019re not, you know\u2026 I know. It\u2019s true. \u2026you can all do this. We\u2019re all qualified. Yeah. We are all qualified to do this. Yeah. Because I think all we\u2019re really doing is setting an example. And I\u2019m hoping that other people will use our work to open the door to those conversations themselves. Yeah, I totally agree with you. We\u2019re so form \u2014 we have these few templates about how you discuss a difficult issue. And it\u2019s a dead-end, and we know how it will end. Yeah. But if you can start it with a different framing question. Yeah. And you can have a completely different conversation. Well, like people talk about citizen journalism, now. And citizen journalism, I think, is important. I appreciate it, because we were taught \u2014 last night at dinner was funny. These ladies asked me to, um, take a picture of them. And they had a camera. I\u2019m like, wow, a camera. I haven\u2019t used one of these in years. Where\u2019s your phone? I said, let me have your phone. And so, you know, so like the technology has allowed people to kind of take pictures of things that are happening and to make that journalism. And I appreciate the importance of that. But I would like \u2014 I think people can practice journalism in other ways. And the technology is not the relevant aspect of it. The relevant aspect of it is the question and the listening. And anyone can do that. You can listen again and share this conversation with Michel Martin through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in the third episode of our American Consciousness series, we\u2019re with NPR\u2019s Michel Martin, mining her wisdom on the emerging fabric of human identity. Her journalism seeks a fuller, more generous and more realistic sweep of who we are now \u2014 and how we\u2019re recreating common life. She reported for The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and ABC\u2019s \u201CNightline\u201D before she joined NPR in 2006 to create and host Tell Me More. That daily program broadcast its last show in August, 2014, just a week before I spoke with her at the Chautauqua Institution. So again, what we\u2019re used to getting, especially from news, is uh, the extraordinarily terrible thing that happened today, right? We get pictures of people frozen in the worst moment of their lives. And we get that same terrible picture ten or 100 times and the news cycle moves on. I think what you\u2019ve tried to cover and draw out is how people survive, flourish, grow, keep loving and laughing, which is also part of the story. Right? There is also this irony that good news is not as riveting. I mean, good is not as riveting as evil. I mean, I say that, and I \u2014 and I \u2014 as I say it, I think, you know, part of what I want to do is show that good can be as riveting and that you have to draw it out a certain way. But you know what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s this thing to work with. Well, I mean, tricky question for me, because I \u2014 because both things can be true. I mean, if you are a person in dire circumstance, then being noticed, that\u2019s the most important thing you can do for that person. I mean, I think sometimes what we do as journalists is, if I could use this expression, a ministry of presence. Mm-hmm. What we are simply saying is, I see you. I mean, I know for example when \u2014 you know, when I was working for \u201CNightline,\u201D and I went to Turkey after there was a terrible earthquake there, and like, you know, thousands of people were killed. And I was feeling really useless. Um, thinking, boy I wish I were a doctor. I wish I were a structural engineer. I wish I could do something more useful. But then people would come up to me and say, thank you for being here. And I would feel, like, wow, why are thanking me? And then I thought \u2014 and I called my \u2014 you know what we do at a time like this. You know, I called my husband, because I really feel like so useless. What am I doing here? And he said, you are showing them that they exist. And I appreciated that, because I\u2019ve held onto that. It\u2019s like sometimes the best thing we can do for people is let them know that we see them. Mm-hmm. And so sometimes, you know, other people\u2019s bad news is, you know, their lifeline, and letting them be understood. In fact, this was the very first story I did when I was at The Post as a little baby reporter at The Washington Post, and I was sent out on the summer \u2014 it was one of those terrible stories that you hate to do because some little boy had fallen out the window of the projects. Yeah. And I had to knock on the woman\u2019s door to get a comment from her. And I kid you not, I walked around the block three times before I mustered the courage to knock on her door, because I knew I had to. And I felt like, you know, and I knocked on the door. And she \u2014 and I said, I\u2019m so sorry, I heard about your son, I came to see if there was any \u2014 a comment that you had. And she said, where have you been? Because she felt that if someone from the media didn\u2019t come, then this was invisible and it had no meaning. And she had things she wanted to say, like why weren\u2019t there any safety screens on the windows, which there were supposed to be. So, I bring that up to say a lot of times, what sometimes what middle class people see as intrusion, other people with no power see as validating their existence. Yeah. So, both things need to happen. Mm-hmm. And I think part of what we do in the media is we are a bridge to people who are isolated for whatever reason. And I think we can be that connection. I mean, I \u2014 \u00A0like you, I\u2019m disappointed that we don\u2019t often use that connection for better purpose. And, you know, I continue to be puzzled by why that is. But, uh, you know, one has to be hopeful because \u2014 you know, to rise in the morning is to have hope, isn\u2019t it? you know, I mean, let\u2019s just \u2014 I happened to be driving across the country when all the Trayvon Martin, I think, at some point in \u2014 \u00A0at one of the days in that \u2014 in that whole drama where it was on the news again. And, you know, you \u00A0drew out people on every side of that human drama, people who loved both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, for example. And I think that, you know, you actually delivered a sermon that I listened to online. I think you \u2014 we may be the only public radio hosts who\u2019ve given sermons. I don\u2019t know. I bet Ray Suarez has done a sermon somewhere, too. Um, you talked about also the need \u2014 and I think you were speaking to journalism as well. But in our culture, for the \u2018What now? What next?\u2019 question. Right? So, like, even in telling that woman\u2019s story, and just witnessing \u2014 being \u2014 bearing witness to her reality, almost the moral challenge we have to also help ourselves and our listeners, our \u2014 consumers of our journalism start looking towards hope beyond that moment. And also maybe their place \u2014 their potential place in that. Well, I thank you for that. That is a \u2014 that is a high compliment. Um, and so I thank you for that. You know, on the Trayvon story, that I have to say that one of the things that, um, I offer a challenge to white people who care about these issues to stop allowing themselves to be disappeared in this story. And it happens time and time again. I interviewed the Congresswoman Corrine Brown who represents the district where this took place. And she is an African-American woman, and she told me that the first person to meet her at the airport to talk to her about this, was a white parent in that neighborhood who was outraged about what had happened. And he met her at the airport when she came in for her district visit, and said, \u201CYou\u2019ve got to get on this. This is wrong.\u201D But somehow that voice has disappeared. Yeah. In that story. Yeah. And similarly, who were many of the witnesses who talked about what happened who felt that, you know, that an injustice had been done, they were white parents in that neighborhood. And similarly, I remember I had a speaking engagement up at Syracuse, and it was a number of \u2014 there was, you know, ladies who lunch, kind of thing, I don\u2019t know what it was. It was like a group of people \u2014 they were supporters of the public radio station. I remember a number of these people came up to me, who were white, I\u2019m saying that in air quotes, whose grandchildren were black, or who had kids who were biracial. Yeah. And they were saying, you know, this has really rocked my world. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, you know, why don\u2019t you see these voices in that story? Yeah. Why is it that \u2014 so my challenge is that when you have institutions that are failing, citizens must rise. And I feel that I would like that people who do not see themselves in these narratives to step forward and demand to be heard. Because the dynamic of the black people are over here, mad, and the white people are over here with George Zimmerman, is simply not true. Yeah. Is simply not true. And I, you know, tried to interrupt that dynamic, that binary dynamic, which I know to be false, but you know, I\u2019d like some help. I\u2019m looking at you. Yeah, I like that. And I like the idea of journalism in the 21st century being more interactive, which it is. Yeah. Except what have we done? We created comment sections, which are full of vitriol, right? But interactive in a real way. I mean, you also, in your sermon, which was excellent, I think, if you are looking for another career, you should think about that. Um, you said, you know, and here you\u2019re speaking to yourself, but you\u2019re also speaking to consumers of news. Maybe we could stop being bored with the stories of how hard things are, keep paying attention after the verdict is rendered and the story is no longer in the headlines. That\u2019s a challenge to all of us. It\u2019s a really interesting question, because for example, I have never wanted my work to be seen as a repudiation of other peoples\u2019 work like my colleagues. No, yeah. Particularly people who do like the drive time shows, like the morning show and the afternoon show. They feel like it\u2019s their job to tell you the thing that you need to know right now. And I just don\u2019t feel that way. I\u2019ve never felt that that way. I mean, when \u2014 before I went to NPR when I was working at \u201CNightline,\u201D it, you know, which is 11:35, I mean my colleague and my, you know, mentor Ted Koppel, I mean one of the reasons he always wanted to be on at 11:35 at night was that other people weren\u2019t fighting over that space. Right. So he could kind of put on the programming that he felt was most important. Mm-hmm. And so, one of the reasons I liked being on in mid-day is I don\u2019t \u2014 I never felt that I had to do the one story that everybody feels they have to \u2014 the same story that they\u2019re doing over and over, and over again. I never felt that I had to do that. And that\u2019s kind of my challenge, is how do I, you know, recreate that opportunity. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: in a live conversation with journalist Michel Martin. We\u2019re in the outdoor hall of philosophy at the Chautauqua Institution in New York in a week devoted to exploring the \u201CAmerican Consciousness.\u201D I want to open this up\u2026 Oh, yeah. \u2026to all of you in just a minute. Um, there\u2019s so many things I wanted to talk to you about. Um\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I know, except they are. I\u2019m happy to keep you company until\u2026 You \u2014 you wrote a piece that\u2019s gotten a lot of attention in the National Journal recently. Yes, mm-hmm. Playing off \u00A0the piece by Anne-Marie Slaughter, which got a lot of attention earlier, a few months ago, um, this idea that women can have it all is just not true, and those of us who grew up in a world believing we could have it all, one day you wake up and you have children, you have a job, and you realize it wasn\u2019t true. And you still have to work this out for yourself. Um, and you pointed out that, uh, even when we start to have that discussion, which is overdue, that it still ends up being a discussion not really about women, but about a certain class of privileged white women. Well, I was very, um, it\u2019s interesting because they \u2014 the National Journal asked me if I wanted to offer some reflections on this piece. And, um, I didn\u2019t realize I had that much to say about it, until I just started writing about it. Well, and you said, what did you say? You said this is your version of King\u2019s Letter from Birmingham Jail. So, tell me why that analogy, I mean, because that\u2019s a big statement. It is a big statement, and I apologize if it sounds grandiose, because I don\u2019t mean it to, uh, but it was, because I felt like I had been in so many rooms where people kept talking about \u201Cwe\u201D this, and \u201Cwe\u201D that, and they weren\u2019t talking about me. And again, it was not aimed at the mean, you know, racist people who don\u2019t want to hear it. It was aimed at the good people who are oblivious to other people\u2019s truths. Yeah. And they\u2019re sitting right there. They\u2019re colleagues, people down the street. Mm-hmm. And I guess I want to say, again, that here\u2019s what \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 you want to know about my real charge to people is? My real charge to people is look around and see who\u2019s missing. And try to invite that person. In any given moment\u2026 In any\u2026 \u2026in any given situation. Look around. Who\u2019s not here? Who\u2019s not here? Who\u2019s not here? And see \u2014 and I know, you know, and a lot of people think, well, you know, I don\u2019t want people to be mean about it. Well, OK. So? Go on to the next person. Who\u2019s not mean and say you know, I was thinking, this group is just a little narrow, and would you \u2014 \u00A0you know. You know, like, for example, I\u2019ll give you an example. There was this women \u2014 you know the PepsiCo chairman, Indra Nooyi is the chairman of PepsiCo. Yeah. And she gave this talk at the Aspen Ideas Festival. It was \u2014 got a lot of attention about her, you know, here she\u2019s this big executive of this Fortune 500 company, and she talked about how at her children\u2019s school they had all these coffees at 9:00 in the morning on Wednesday when the working mothers couldn\u2019t go. And so, and that made her sad. And I was like, does this woman not write a check to these people? Yeah. I was thinking what \u2014 and then she talked about how she\u2019d called up, you know, some of the other mothers to find out who also didn\u2019t go. Why don\u2019t you call up the other mothers and say, hey what? How about we switch it up? Right. So that sometimes you can go, and sometimes we can go. How about you call that school and say, you know what, you have excluded an entire class of people who, oh by the way, are writing the checks for your tuition. Right. Why don\u2019t you think about sometimes at 9:00 in the morning, sometimes at 6:00 when we can go. How about switching it up. You see my point? Yeah. So there\u2019s all this, like, I\u2019m sad that this is this way. OK. What is the one thing you could do to fix it? Go do that thing. Just go do that thing. That\u2019s good. You know? So, anyway. Um, in Charleston, West Virginia, we have a excellent shelter for physically abused women, who when they escaped from the situation, they have a place to live and stay, and they get food, and shelter, and everything they need. They can bring their kids there until they can move on to the next part of their life. And, um, the Today Show has a program where, in \u2014 once a year, Al Roker goes out with a truck and donates things that places like that need. So, they came, they interviewed, uh, the director of this program, and multiple times, she made it very clear that this was totally funded and developed and initiated by a group of Christian churches, Protestant churches, and the Jewish synagogue, and the Jewish temple, OK. And I mean, she said it multiple times. So when they showed the piece on this, no mention of Christ, no mention of Christianity, no mention of Judaism, no mention of religion in any way. And that was a fact, I mean, this \u2014 that\u2026 I believe you. She didn\u2019t make this up. I believe you. That was a true fact. Why does mainstream media feel compelled to just leave that out of stories? I mean, I \u2014 I completely believe you, and I think it\u2019s the same reason something I talked about, you know, earlier, which is this whole thing of, like, I don\u2019t see color. Now in part, I would say, I think it\u2019s because a lot of people who are kind of trained in a certain style of journalism have been led to believe that it\u2019s icky, and therefore, you know, you can\u2019t win, and somebody\u2019s going to be mad. So you\u2019re looking for this false middle. Right? I will say, I think that\u2019s \u2014 it was a terrible editorial decision. And I think that\u2019s the kind of thing that cries out for a person to call him up and say let me explain to you why that\u2019s a bad idea. You missed a fundamental part of the story. And I just think that people have been trained in a certain way, and I think it\u2019s also unfortunate that a certain wing of Christendom has so captured public dialogue in the current era that people associate any kind of, you know, religiously motivated experience with the bully-boy wing. Yeah. You know. And I just think it\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s a shame and I\u2019m sorry that happened. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late. And I think that you should call them back. It\u2019s not. I think you should call them back. First, I think you\u2019re both national treasures. Thank you. And I was\u2026 \u2026extremely disappointed personally when I learned, Michel, about your program being canceled. Um, what I\u2019m wondering is to look forward in the broader realm of journalism, it\u2019s going through a lot of changes, it\u2019s messy, it\u2019s crummy when it makes some of the kinds of decisions it made recently. Um, what would be your hopes with a tinge of reality in terms of if there are some positive possibilities for journalism as it goes through this messy transformation? What do you see as possible that might come out of it in the future? Well, I will say one of the things that \u2014 on the \u2014 in the near term, the \u00A0disappointing note, and \u00A0I will not end on a disappointing note, but on the disappointed note is that there are a number of new media outlets, which are even less diverse than the old media outlets. I mean, this is very disturbing to me. And I just think that can\u2019t continue. And this is the kind of thing where I would ask people to use their voices in the audience to say, not acceptable. I mean, it can\u2019t just be me. Right? I can\u2019t just be like, you know, it\u2019s got to be the audience broadly defined saying this is not acceptable. This is not what we expect and you need to do better. Because I guarantee you, they will. Um, I am hopeful, because as I said to get up in the morning is to be hopeful. And that \u2014 I see enough of an appetite for the kind of work that we do that my feeling is that if we can get a couple of the pieces right, then we can change the paradigm. Because people who \u2014 when we change the structures, we change what\u2019s possible. I mean, why does a place like this exist? Because somebody needed \u2014 people had the idea of creating a structure where different things can happen. And the people created this and then revised it over time. And so that to me is what needs to happen in our field, and I\u2019m hopeful that we will figure that out. So I just want to ask you two quick questions before we finish. Um, I wonder as you have pursued the stories that aren\u2019t told, as you\u2019ve interviewed so many different kinds of people about so many aspects of life these last years, this is a big question, but how has this shaped, evolved, the way you think about what it means to be human? I know it\u2019s huge, but what comes to mind? It \u2014 you know, it\u2019s, um, it\u2019s interesting that, uh, one of my, um, mentors, you know, Ted Koppel, told me that you know, the more famous he got, the more humble he got. You may or may not know this about him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d mind my telling you this. He was actually quite a fiery young man. He was kind of a spicy young man who would like he\u2019d throw hands over a parking space. I mean, he was just an angry young guy. I mean, I think he\u2019s written about this, so hopefully I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. But, uh, that era has long since passed, and he quoted that, that when he got older and became more famous and people were just so nice to him just for existing, he found it really hard to be angry, or, you know, to be so caught up in something so petty seemed so wrong. And, um, I was never that way, I\u2019ll just be honest. I but the more you get to know people, and the more they trust you to tell their stories to you, they \u2014 they \u2014 it\u2019s like a gift. Every time somebody tells me their story, I feel that they have given me something precious. And it\u2019s my job to protect it. And, I \u2014 and that cannot help but change you. And, um, you know, you wrote me another beautiful note, you know, I think, some people know this after my brother died. Yeah. He took his own life, um, very, very hard. And he had been a responder after 9/11. He\u2019d been a first responder. 9/11. Yeah. And, you know, I, um, had to learn a lot about \u2014 that brought me into a community of people that I had not been part of before. And, there is no why. There is a why, but the why doesn\u2019t really matter. You know, he was my brother, and I loved him. And he\u2019s not here. But it brought me into connection with so many people who had had that experience that all I can say is thank you, because they gave me that gift of connection. And not leaving me alone in my pain. And so, I think I would say that, um, really what I\u2019m left with is gratitude, such profound gratitude, that people despite all of their pain and all of what people go through, are still willing to reach out to each other. And, um, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve answered your question, but I feel that it\u2019s just made my world so much larger, and I hope that I\u2019ve done just this much to make the world larger for other people. Thank you."
