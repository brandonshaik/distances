  "fullText": "Sometimes you have to fight things, when people want to kill you, when people want to blow you up, then you have to fight them. But that\u2019s not the case with the vast majority of people who could possibly become tomorrow\u2019s terrorists. That\u2019s where the fight for the world will be. It will be in the next generation of these young people, the ones caught between should we go the path of happiness as martyrdom or should we go to the path of yes, we can. They\u2019re both very enticing paths. I think one has a lot more to offer, but we have to show them it has more to offer, and we have to show them now. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for right now. For over a decade, the French-American anthropologist Scott Atran has been listening to the hopes and dreams of young people from Indonesia to Egypt. He\u2019s explored the human dynamics of what we analyze as \u201Cbreeding grounds for terrorism\u201D \u2014 why some young people become susceptible to radicalism and others, in the same circumstances, do not. His work sheds helpful light on the question on so many of our minds as we watch horrific news of the day: How could this happen \u2014 and how could we possibly help transform it? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Scott Atran holds appointments at the University of Michigan, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, and at France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research. He began his career working with the great anthropologist Margaret Mead. In the early years of this century, he turned his attention to global Islamist terrorism. Scott Atran tells some of this story in his 2010 book Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists. I interviewed him the following year. As we begin, I\u2019m interested \u2014 I mean, you have spent a lot of time in recent years studying the power of religion and sacred values in human life, and I did wonder was there any kind of religious background to your life? Oh, not much. I mean, I had a Jewish upbringing and I\u2019m pretty much non religious myself. But I was always interested in religious and ethnic conflict, so I started especially \u2014 actually I first started working on this stuff in the Middle East within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and then sort of branched out across the world as my interests became more general in terms of how human beings think more broadly and what brings them to the ideas they have. I mean, why are there certain universals and general patterns of reasoning and behavior across the species? Mmm. Then I discovered that these notion of sort of transcendent or sacred values is really what drives people forward, what frames who they are, what their existence is all about. It\u2019s not really about struggle over economic possibilities or resources. Those are secondary to the fact that you need them to create who you are. And even more interesting was the groups that are created, human groups, are so different from other animals in that they\u2019re mostly groups of genetic strangers. I mean, take the notion of the nation. It\u2019s a really imagined group of fictive kin and yet people are willing to make the greatest sacrifices, to die and to kill for these groups of genetic strangers that are bound together by these preposterous beliefs. And then I started thinking about our own society\u2019s preposterous beliefs. I mean, think of something like The Declaration of Independence, where they\u2019re taking on the mightiest empire in the world at the time and they say they\u2019re pledging their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor for inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I mean, that\u2019s crazy. If you look at all of human history up until then, and they say that we\u2019re endowed by the creator, it\u2019s all natural, and it worked. I mean, they actually engineered this through different laws and mores and wars, and they changed the world. You know, as you apply this mindset, right, this approach, these core questions that you named basically, you know, how do human beings think, how do they act, how do they \u2014 how are they capable of change over time. You\u2019ve been applying that to this phenomenon of global terrorism or breeding grounds for terrorism. And I know that, over these past few years, when I\u2019ve interviewed, Muslim scholars and thinkers, for example, about Islam, and trying to understand their roots of violence in the name of Islam, people will often kind of reflexively object that what we\u2019re, you know, ultimately trying to do is justify violence or relativize extremism, or humanize crime that needs to be punished. And I wonder if that\u2019s also a criticism that you come under, just for doing the work you do, for asking the questions you ask. Sure, you know, when I talk to, religious leaders, especially those involved in things like Jihad, first thing they do, of course, is give me a Qur\u2019an and try to convert me to their particular point of view. And then are fairly highly suspicious that I\u2019m trying to, hook them into, saying that, their philosophy of life is a violent philosophy of life. Mm-hmm. On the other side I get it from, sort of secular liberals, that I\u2019m, you know, a patsy for these guys, and that I \u2014 I\u2019m an apologist for religion \u2014 you know, sort of Sam Harrison\u2019s latest book points out that I\u2019m moral relativist\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026which I\u2019m really am not. And that my interest is in just sort of this touchy-feely hippie hermeneutics, where everybody can get along in the world. But, my interest in dealing with the Jihadis is both general and concrete. The general part is I\u2019m always interested in those people who are as different from me as possible. Whether in the Maya rainforest, because except for wilderness freaks nobody in our society could last months out there in the middle of the rainforest and survive, but these guys do it all the time\u2026 Mm-hmm. Or these Jihadis \u2014 say, suicide bombers, who blow themselves up, which sort of seems to go against all evolutionary dispositions, for this greater cause. Now, nothing could be further from me. So, my idea is that if I can understand what moves these people, I can much better understand, sort of, what it is to be human. Mm-hmm. And I find they\u2019re really just people like everybody else. And you\u2019re also talking to people who are in those extended spheres of human beings, right? But who don\u2019t actually make that move across the line of bombing a subway train. Right. So if you take, you know, these polls if you put any credence in them, like the Gallup and Pew polls, you find that about 7 percent of the Muslim world has some sympathy for bin Laden. That\u2019s about 100 million people out of 1.3 or .4 billion Muslims in the world. But then if you look who actually is willing to do something violent, you find that it\u2019s an extremely, extremely small number of people. But when you look at \u2014 of those thousands out of the 100 million who actually do anything, you find that the greatest predictor \u2014 it has nothing to do with religion. The greatest predictor is whether they belong to a soccer club or some action-oriented group of friends. Right. In fact, almost none of them had any religious education whatsoever. They\u2019re all born again, sort of between the ages of 18 and 22. So if it\u2019s not religious inculcation, if it\u2019s not religious training, if it\u2019s not even religious tradition, what could it possibly be? And again, it\u2019s first of all who your friends are. That\u2019s the greatest predictor of everything. Mm-hmm. Hm. Then there\u2019s a sort of geopolitical aspect to it. I mean, people talk about a clash of civilizations. I think that\u2019s dead wrong. There\u2019s a crash of territorial cultures across the world. Right. Yeah. I want you to talk about that. I think that\u2019s a very intriguing distinction you draw that it\u2019s not a clash of civilizations, but you\u2019ve also said a crash of civilizations. So tell me what you\u2019re describing there. Well, globalization, of course, has provided access to large masses of humanity to a better standard of living, better health, better education. But it has also left in its wake many traditional societies that are falling apart, that just can\u2019t compete. And so what you have is young people especially sort of flailing around looking for a sense of social identity, as these traditional territorial cultures and their influence disappears. And they\u2019re trying to hook up with one another peer to peer. And this is paralleling another new development in history of humanity and that is this massive media-driven global political awakening where, again, for the first time in human history, you\u2019ve got someone in New Guinea who can see the same images as someone in the middle of the Amazon. And so you\u2019ve got these young people, paradoxically, focusing in on a smaller and smaller bandwidth in this sort of global media trying to hook up with one another and make friends and give themselves a sense of significance. And the Jihad comes along. I mean, the Jihad \u2014 you know, I interviewed this guy in prison in France who, wanted to blow up the American Embassy and I asked him, you know, \u201CWhy did you want to do this?\u201D and he says to me, \u201CWell, you know, I\u2019m walking along the street one day and someone spit at my sister and called her sale Arabe, a dirty Arab, and I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I realized that this injustice would never leave French society or Western society, so I joined the Jihad.\u201D I said, \u201CYeah, but that has been going on for years.\u201D And he goes, \u201CYes, but there was no Jihad before.\u201D Mm. Mm-hmm. So it\u2019s a sort of receptacle. You find it\u2019s especially appealing to young people in transitional stages in their lives: immigrants, students, people in search of jobs or mates, or between jobs and mates, and it gives a sense of empowerment that their own societies certainly don\u2019t. Yeah. I mean, the message of the Jihad is, look, you, any of you, any of you out there, you too can cut off the head of Goliath with a paper cutter. That\u2019s what we did. Mm. We changed the world with paper cutters. That\u2019s all you need. All you need is will and truth and meaning, and you will correct injustice in the world and you\u2019ll be heroic and you\u2019ll have the greatest adventure of your lives. And that\u2019s surely powerful. And are you drawing connections between this scenario you just described of hopes and dreams and also skewed hopes and dreams with this ferment that\u2019s now happening? Oh, yes, absolutely. So let me just sort of give you two anecdotes that comes out of my work with the Madrid bombing. So, I went to trial and I interviewed, you know, the surviving plotters and their families and their friends. And then what I discovered was that of the seven plotters who, when cornered by police blew themselves up, were actually from a little barrio in a northern Moroccan town, T\u00E9touan, called the Jamaa Mezuak. So I went there and found out they all grew up within about 200 meters of one another, and then some more of their friends \u2014 they all went to the same elementary school. You know, this elementary school had Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, they all went to the same high school except for one who was brilliant and then, went to train with the, Moroccan Royal Air Force. And then, when they blew themselves up, some friends and kinsmen, other young people went to Iraq to blow themselves up. And, while I\u2019m in this neighborhood, two things struck me. First, all of those kids, none of them had a religious education to speak of. They all came into religion quite late. In fact, some of them right before the plots. And they were involved in Spain in petty criminal activities, drug trading. It\u2019s these guys who were killing themselves. Hmm. Now, what that means is they\u2019re sacrificing the totality of their self-interests, which goes against all economic theory, and giving up their lives for an idea. Why? Because all of a sudden, they are telling themselves we really don\u2019t want to be criminals. We want to be somebody. We want to be something significant in this world and this is our chance. And then I started interviewing the little kids. Well, first I tried interviewing the 18-year-olds. I would ask them, you know, \u201CWho\u2019s your hero?\u201D and they\u2019d tell me, \u201CGeorge Bush\u201D or \u201CDick Cheney\u201D or \u201CDon Rumsfeld.\u201D They were just pulling my leg. OK. The younger ones don\u2019t lie, right? So they\u2019re all playing soccer \u2014 their world is sort of divided between the Barcelona soccer team and the Real Madrid soccer team \u2014 and I\u2019m asking them what they want to be in life. The answers were sort of stunning. I mean, the first little kid, eight years old, he tells me, \u201CI want to be an archaeologist.\u201D I say, \u201CWhy? You want to get treasure?\u201D He goes, \u201CNo, I want to find out who we are.\u201D Mm. Then the next kid says, \u201CI want to be a doctor, a surgeon.\u201D And then I say, \u201COK, who\u2019re your heroes?\u201D Number one hero, Ronaldinho, who\u2019s a Barcelona soccer player. OK. Number two hero, The Terminator \u2014 no idea he\u2019s related to the past governor of California. And number three was Osama bin Laden. Then I went back a week after Barack Obama\u2019s election and I did the same survey in a few towns. Number one was a sort of tie between soccer guys, Sergio Morales from the Real Madrid team, Eto\u2019o, a striker from Barcelona. Number two now was Terminator II, and number three, just beating out bin Laden, was Barack Obama. Mm. So what is that telling us? It\u2019s telling us that these young people are looking for something important and they\u2019re looking around for role models in life and where are they finding them? Well, they\u2019re finding them in soccer, which is exciting; they\u2019re finding them in action figure heroes, which is also exciting. And these political figures would seem to agitate everything that\u2019s going on. I mean, it\u2019s mostly in barbershops and fast-food restaurants and caf\u00E9s and on the streets that peoples\u2019 images of society are formed. Right. And, Barack Obama suddenly appears on the scene and is a hope for these young people. They just look at the guy\u2019s face, you know, and the color his skin and they say, if he can do it, we can do it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with anthropologist Scott Atran. My conversation with him predated the recent spectacle of ISIS. But his long fieldwork on why young people succumb to \u2014 or resist \u2014 radicalism speaks to an ongoing challenge: the dangerous distraction, as Scott Atran describes it, of over-emphasizing the threat of any terrorist group itself, beginning with al-Qaeda. You\u2019re right. I mean, there tends to be this generalized view of terrorism and it\u2019s all al-Qaeda, right? And it\u2019s not even what al-Qaeda is, but something that we imagined on September 11, 2001, I mean\u2026 Al-Qaeda was a specific group and they were a specific group of bad guys that got lucky. There hasn\u2019t been one successful attack against the United States since 9/11. Most of the plots are sting plots by our law enforcement agencies. All the plots in Europe were not al-Qaeda directed. None of them were except for a sort of indirect one in the London underground bombings. They\u2019re completely homegrown. I think never in human history have so few people with so few actual means cause such fear in so many, but it\u2019s not an existential threat to our society and it\u2019s blinding us to the possibilities of political change, and political change which really could bring the world forward in an interesting way. Mm-hmm. So, you know, I wanna keep talking about what you know from the scope of your work about the human dynamics that have fed, the terrorist threat in recent years in the world. I mean, so one thing you mentioned a minute ago, is that we have been able to look at particular \u2014 at schools, for example, that have been then labeled breeding grounds for terrorism \u2014 madrasas. One of the observations you made is that \u2014 I think you\u2019re saying that we\u2019re not necessarily asking the right questions, we\u2019re not saying, \u201CWhat is it about that school that makes it a breeding ground for terrorism?\u201D But the more pertinent question might be, \u201CWhat is it about human friendship that becomes such a powerful force?\u201D Yeah I think that\u2019s right on, I mean, what is it about the way people bond? And even law enforcement \u2014 so I\u2019m asked a lot to brief law enforcement or counterintelligence or, you know, military people about what I find in the field\u2026 Mm-hmm. And, I find that they always concentrate on people who actually do things: who are involved in plots, or who do something they call criminal \u2014 just like, you know, the law enforcement or FBI concentrates on the criminal act and actor. Then you realize that, first of all theres no command and control or hierarchy to any of this. It\u2019s pretty spontaneous, the Jihad. And people come in and out of it all the time. Mm-hmm. They don\u2019t even know what the others are up to. Their plots are sort of scatter-brained. All of them fail except for one or two. OK? Mm-hmm. Out of the hundreds of plots, how many have succeeded? Really, almost none. And if you look at even the ones who have succeeded, like Madrid, it was 39 people who didn\u2019t know what the other was doing. It was \u2014 I can tell you \u2014 it was like the Keystone Cops, it was so ridiculous with the police infiltrating three different groups, but never able to figure out what was going on. The groups themselves weren\u2019t able to figure out what was going on. 9/11, too, the Hamburg plotters \u2014 the bomb plotters \u2014 like Atta and Jarrah and al-Shehhi, they were confused guys, they were sort of doubly alienated in their neighborhood in Hamburg, they weren\u2019t Turks they weren\u2019t Germans, they were all Middle Easterners. And they wanted to go to Bosnia \u2014 they got an apartment together, they sort of got into their parallel universe. Right. The neighbors told us the place stank because they never went out of the apartment. They brought in like twenty mattresses for their fellow travelers. They watched videos of Bosnia and things. They came out of their cocoon wanting to do something heroic. So they wanted to go to Bosnia and the Bosnians told them \u201CForget it. Maybe you can get us some Russian goggles or something that are coming on the market in Germany.\u201D Then they wanted to go to Chechnya and someone said, \u201CWell the Russians aren\u2019t gonna let you into Chechnya.\u201D Then they met somebody on a train who basically said, \u201CWell maybe if you go to Pakistan you can eventually get to Chechnya. And they wound up, basically near al-Qaeda where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \u2014 whose proposal to al-Qaeda \u2014 I mean, al-Qaeda\u2019s like a funding organization, like the National Science Foundation. OK. You know, you apply to it. Nobody \u2014 they have no recruiters, I mean, people go looking for it they don\u2019t go looking for anybody \u2014 they accepted about fifteen to twenty percent of their applicants and they accepted Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s proposal to blow up planes. And he basically said to bin Laden, \u201CLook boss, look what I got. I got these guys who wanna go to Chechnya, they got visas, maybe we can use \u2018em.\u201D So they\u2019re out there looking for adventure and you don\u2019t even know which ones will eventually wind up in the plot or doing anything. Because, again, they themselves don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. They have these sort of vague ideals and motives and hopes and desires. Mm-hmm. It congeals almost randomly around an opportunity that arises spontaneously. But you also have said, uncategorically, and I believe you\u2019ve said this in testimony before congress that people in the end don\u2019t kill for a cause, they kill and die for each other. That it\u2019s those human bonds. Yeah. I mean, if you look at them. You know, people often ask me, so, how we gonna, you know, come up with these sophisticated models and predictors and I say, \u201CYou really wanna know, you know, who\u2019s involved in a plot? Well, find one of the guys and look at what he eats and what he wears. And then you\u2019ll find the others.\u201D Because they\u2019re friends. Almost all of them are friends. Sometimes there\u2019s a family member, you know, a cousin or something and then friends start marrying one another\u2019s sisters because this is just cook for them, and they get to know one another. So you really wanna know who gets involved, look at their networks, look at their \u2014 look at what they eat, look at what they wear, look where they hang out. And it\u2019s not in mosques, by the way, people pray in mosques, you gotta be quiet. You plot in barber shops, you plot in cafes, fast food restaurants, you plot in soccer fields. You plot at picnics. You know, I found so many plots in weddings because it\u2019s like the opening scene of The Godfather, you know, people shmooze and mingle. It\u2019s a great place to get family and friends together and plot. OK, now here\u2019s another really interesting thing you\u2019ve pointed out, that organizations that are effective in bringing off these kinds of things awaken this instinct of family and tribe that\u2019s so strong in us as human beings, right? That we\u2019re biologically hardwired. I mean, I think that\u2019s a really interesting point and it\u2019s no accident that the names of organizations will be something like the Muslim Brotherhood or, you know, Bands of Brothers. We think of that when human beings are capable of things that we wouldn\u2019t normally do, for those who we consider to be part of our family. Yeah, that\u2019s sort of the \u2014 you\u2019ve sort of got the essence of what I\u2019m actually interested in. I mean, I know of no political movement or territorial movement or even transnational movement \u2014 that is, no large grouping of human beings that don\u2019t consider themselves in terms of brotherhoods or sisterhoods or fatherlands or homelands or motherlands. All that family vocabulary. And it\u2019s very strong. And all the sort of rites of passage and oaths people say are all couched in terms of these families. Mmm. Now these families, they\u2019re biologically weaker, of course, than real genetic families. But how in the end do they become stronger? Well, there are evolutionary reasons why human beings who are absolutely the weakest of all primates physically bond together with strangers to survive. And we got into competition with larger and larger groups and we needed mechanisms to build these larger and larger groups, and that\u2019s what these sacred and transcendental values are all about. Now here\u2019s the interesting thing. Monotheism created something completely new in the history of the world. The Jewish notion of a chosen people under God and the Greek notion of universal laws merged in these universal religions along the Silk Road, along these Eurasian commercial networks, and they started the notion that human beings could be saved, that there was good \u2014 those who were saved \u2014 and there were evil, those who were bad. No cultures before that actually thought in terms of good and evil. They thought in terms of the other? I mean, the tribal other, but not \u2026 \u2026 the tribal other. But now with the European Enlightenment and the French Revolution, these universal monotheisms became secularized and brought down to earth. But if you think about it, these secular ideologies, all modern secular ideologies, all the isms: fascism, communism, socialism, anarchism, colonialism, democratic liberalism, are all variants on this monotheistic theme, however secular they are in appearance. They\u2019re salvational Messianic ideologies which believes the world must be saved and should be saved whether they like it or not, and that\u2019s what drives us. You can listen again and share this conversation with Scott Atran through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this On Being. Today, with the French-American anthropologist Scott Atran, we\u2019re seeking context, pulling back a human lens on dynamics unfolding in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and beyond. Scott Atran is the author of Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood and the (Un)Making of Terrorists. His global field work examines the conditions that drive young people into, as well as away from, violent radicalism. What he\u2019s learned is not what we generally talk about when we analyze these events in news and strategic terms. So, tell me what you\u2019ve learned in these past years as you have been out there talking to suicide bombers and potential suicide bombers. I mean, what have you learned about how people get out, how they walk away from that how that longing and that passion can be transferred in more positive directions? What\u2019s powerful enough to take them away? Well, as you sort of implied, there\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a pathway to violence, and it depends on where along this pathway you catch these young people. So, it usually happens like this. So, there\u2019s sort of a larger counterculture out there. For whatever reason, people are not happy. They believe there\u2019s injustice in the current state of things, and so they protest and they want change. Then usually what happens is that a small group, for whatever reason, maybe one or two individuals in this small group break away from this sort of counterculture and they say, \u201CYou guys haven\u2019t been doing enough. You\u2019ve been talking and talking and talking and nothing has happened and we\u2019re going to do something.\u201D And when they break away, we find they move into a sort of parallel world. They usually get a place together or go out into the country together and live their sort of isolated life or lock themselves up in an apartment or somehow withdraw and build this world that they think is better and will be better through their actions. Now once they\u2019re in this mode, it\u2019s a lot harder to get to them because they\u2019re sort of locked in. They\u2019ve built this sort of sacred view of one another and they\u2019ve locked it into their own personal friendships so that the notion of the cause and their friendship is almost inextricably bound. And once they\u2019re in that stage, the only people I\u2019ve found that can bring them out of it are those very, very close to them that haven\u2019t made this move. So the only groups that I \u2026 \u2026 so, again, it comes down to this relational, the friendship circle somehow. Yeah. So, I was in Sulawesi with a bunch called al-Muqatila, suicide attackers, against Christian militia. The only ones who could get them out were a group of Salafis who talked to them and said, \u201CLook, I understand what you want. You want to reduce injustice in the world. You want Islam to prosper. This isn\u2019t the way to do it. This is a better way.\u201D And they got them to do it. Now when I hear our people or president of France talk about, you know, we\u2019re going to have moderate imams and preach the true nature of religion to these people, I ask what world are these leaders living in? First of all, moderate, you gotta be kidding. When was the last time you told your kids to be moderate about their boyfriends or choice of career? I mean, they basically say, \u201CYeah right, Mom; right, Dad, OK,\u201D and then they become \u2014 and as far as true message of religion, the whole thing about religion is it has no true message. It is true for people in a certain time in a certain context. Otherwise, religions would have disappeared once conditions changed. So it can\u2019t be about some eternal message and it can\u2019t be about moderation. It\u2019s got to be, again, about things that are exciting, thrilling, hopes and dreams. And if we go back to that poll I took where Obama beat out bin Laden, that was in November 2009. But look what happens now. We just did a poll, comes out in 2010. He comes out dead last. Ahmadinejad beats him out, Nasrallah beats him out, bin Laden beats him out. OK, so what\u2019s that about? It\u2019s because these young people were looking to him for hope and they found their hopes in him. And then, for whatever reason \u2014 and it\u2019s quite understandable from our domestic political agenda that he couldn\u2019t really deliver in a short time on those hopes. And when they look around, they see things like Israel and Palestine or Afghanistan and things get just way worse, then they think that they have been taken down the garden path and they become angry and it\u2019s almost better as if he said nothing at all. Now, again, you know, I often try to talk to even leaders in these different countries and say, \u201CLook, the American political establishment is such that if a president tries to do too much on intractable foreign conflicts, especially in his first administration, then he\u2019s out, so you usually have to wait until the end of the second administration where a president can really concentrate on these intractable issues.\u201D But, again, those people live in their own world and their own priorities, and so they see this as hypocritical rather than\u2026 Well, Americans don\u2019t even have patience for that, right? . Yeah, but they\u2019re a little more understanding. Yeah. Something that comes up in your writing and is very much on my mind is we have no memory in the United States of how important religiously based, very deeply religiously based civic organizations were in the beginnings of American democracy, right? The YMCA, the YWCA, the Boy Scouts and even well into the 20th century. Do you think about how Islamic Muslim religious organizations can be a very \u2014 could be a very constructive part of what will be young democracies if things unfold peacefully? Yes, they could well be. Now if you look at the history of the United States, you\u2019re right. I mean, when de Tocqueville, even Engels, when he goes to California, he\u2019s writing back to Marx and saying, \u201CLook, we got this all wrong. We\u2019ve got to change the Communist Manifesto.\u201D It\u2019s not the opium after all. I didn\u2019t know that Engels wrote to Marx from California. Yeah. Marx says, well, we\u2019ll deal with it when we \u2014 he goes, \u201CWe got this all wrong.\u201D I mean, these people are very progressive and lively and seem to have free exchanges, and they\u2019re basing their lives in these community churches and things like that. And he goes, \u201CWe\u2019ve just got to reconsider here.\u201D It was America\u2019s community-based religious establishments that were the basis of things like credit. I mean, the Americans virtually \u2014 Right. I mean, the Jewish community introduced credit, but the Americans were the first nation that were based on credit. And credit, which made the economy flow and produce, was strictly a church-based, family-based community affair. I mean, there\u2019s this wonderful anecdote of Max Weber, one of the founders of sociology at the turn of the last century. He was in a train going through the South of the United States and he\u2019s sitting in a car with an undertaker and a sawmill owner. And they\u2019re talking for two days about their families and the church. And then just as the undertaker\u2019s about to get off, he asked for so many million board feet from the sawmill guy. Weber goes, \u201CWell, what the hell happened here? I mean, you guys have been talking for two days. You never mentioned business and, all of a sudden, you make this huge business deal.\u201D And the undertaker says, \u201CWell, sure. I mean, if he didn\u2019t care for his family and his church the way I did, then I wouldn\u2019t give a plumb nickel for the value of the deal.\u201D So it is and it was still and still is to a great deal a part of what made America, America. Mm-hmm. Now that\u2019s falling apart. I mean, Robert Putnam in this wonderful book called Bowling Alone describes how that is breaking apart and that, as a result, we\u2019re into a different culture based on, you know, sort of legalistic lawyerly contracts and transactions and where personal notions of trust, especially with strangers, increases inordinately. And I think that also feeds into our political system. It makes us less able to understand what is happening in the rest of the world. Right. I remember right after the war in Iraq started and ended, back when we were still talking about building civil society, you know, before it just turned into this entrenched conflict. And I spoke with a young Iraqi American who\u2019d been over there with the Coalition Provisional Authority consulting on how to rebuild the school system. He was saying, \u201CWhy isn\u2019t the U.S. government helping create Muslim Chambers of Commerce?\u201D Because that\u2019s exactly the kind of organization that was the glue, again, of early American democracy for hundreds of years. I mean, Christian-based Chambers of Commerce, that kind of thing. Because one of the things is that the reaction to 9/11 has created this notion of Muslims as an alien force, to the United States and a rival in the world. But the idea that, you know, Islam is very similar to Christianity or anything else, I mean, it\u2019s a broad-based social movement. It gives a sense of significance to people. And it runs the gamut just like all religions do basically from good to bad. There\u2019s huge diversity. Everything good you can think of has been religiously inspired from creativity in art and music to intellectual endeavors. And everything bad from war and genocide and murder to torture. But that\u2019s also been the case with secular governments as well. I mean, there are modes of being, of how people reconcile the contradictory yearnings and aspects of their human nature. We need them. We can\u2019t exist in a logical world because we can\u2019t even accept things like death and deception, which are inevitable, because our brains don\u2019t accept it. I mean, if they did, then we\u2019d spend our entire time trying to struggle against it. So there\u2019s a reason that we have these transcendental ideas, however secular in appearance, and unless we find a way to reconcile ourselves with these changes in the world, then I have a feeling we\u2019re going to be left in the lurch. So it\u2019s easier to draw implications, of this kind of insight to how foreign policy might change, right? How diplomats might behave. I wonder how you think about how ordinary citizens might take in some of the larger perspective that you and others offer and, you know, is there a way in this technologically connected world also for American citizens to weigh in more positively, you know, let\u2019s say just taking this premise of yours that so much of our thinking and acting has to start with what it means to be human and take that into account in all its fullness? Well, it\u2019s hard because people are constantly reminded of their sort of tribal aspects, that there\u2019s an enemy out there. And we seem as human beings to need enemies to drive us forward as well. I think that there is a place for spontaneous movements of our people, especially our young people, in forging new ideas and perhaps eventually weighing in on our society. But I had an interesting dinner with someone very close to the president and his administration. And, I went through my sort of shtick about never before have so few people cause such hysteria in so many. And he posed an interesting question to me. He said, \u201COK, maybe the president agrees with you. Maybe the president does agree that the threat of terrorism and the reaction of the United States to it has been outsized, that we have overreacted, but now what do you do? What would you advise the president to do to help convince the American people that the political landscape has changed and we should deal with the rest of the world in a different way?\u201D So it\u2019s a little bit like turn \u2014 the way policy works, is you \u2014 it\u2019s like turning a giant aircraft carrier in a small port. Right, yeah. You cannot give, as most people do on their blogs or in op-eds, these grand sudden changes and expect them to be meaningful at all. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s got to be by small steps and what small steps? Well, I went to the University of Virginia and the University of Michigan and I posed this to, you know, foreign policy people. And I said, \u201CSo what would you suggest?\u201D It\u2019s fascinating. They all come with data-driven, evidence-based arguments for what\u2019s wrong and what we should do. And I sort of said, \u201CLook, guys, that\u2019s not going to work. First of all, outside of the economy, people are not interested in evidence and data or even truth. People are interested in persuading, in victory, and confirming what they believe in or love. Second, you haven\u2019t addressed any of the emotional aspects of this which really drive people\u2026 Right. \u2026revenge, revenge and fear. Fear. Mm-hmm. You haven\u2019t even touched on those. How do you lessen that? Why is it that an earthquake or what was called back in the 1920s in an old study by Henry Ford, the \u201Cjerk effect\u201D when all of a sudden you hit a pothole, why is that so much more powerful emotionally than real threats? You know, if you look at the data, you\u2019d find that even frequent flyers have a better chance of being killed by a lawnmower than in a terrorist attack. OK. But people aren\u2019t worried about dying by lawnmower. Didn\u2019t you tell a story in one of your books about, even at the height of the Cold War, that some American president said that, if only we were attacked by Martians, we would \u2014 all of our differences would disappear? Right. That\u2019s Reagan to Gorbachev when walking in the woods. Reagan to Gorbachev, right, right. Yeah but that\u2019s the \u2014 see, here\u2019s what I think is the greatest political challenge of all. In addition to dealing with fear and revenge, there\u2019s something which I like to call sort of the principle of enmity. Human beings are most mobilized when we have enemies. Just look at novels. Look at the news. No one\u2019s interested in happy, good-feeling cooperative things. I mean, people \u2014 when they\u2019re tired of war and they\u2019re tired of conflict and competition, then they\u2019ll go back on it. But what really drives interest and passion is competition and conflict. So the question is, can we actually lessen conflict without having enemies? Well, there are two answers to that. One is the sort of Gorbachev/Reagan \u2014 Reagan\u2019s proposal to Gorbachev. We can come up with some kind of enemy, maybe an \u2026 Yet another common enemy. And the enemy of my enemy, right? Or we can change it to a sort of abstract enemy like poverty or killing or something like that. And that sort of reminds me of how I actually ended the book. You know, Abraham Lincoln is making a speech during the latter stages of the Civil War where he\u2019s describing the Southern rebels as human beings like anyone else. And a woman, an elderly woman, a staunch Unionist, abrades him for speaking kindly of his enemies when he should only be thinking of destroying them. And Lincoln says to the woman, \u201CMadam, do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?\u201D And if you think about it, wars are truly won only in two ways. You either exterminate your enemy or you make them your friends. And I think that we have not thought very deeply about the latter alternative, especially when I see how we\u2019re reacting to these young people around the world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with anthropologist Scott Atran. For the past decade, he\u2019s listened to the hopes and dreams of young people from Indonesia to Egypt. He\u2019s explored the human aspects of what we speak of, in political terms, as \u201Cbreeding grounds for terrorists.\u201D This does present a moment of opportunity, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, you have been writing about this restlessness and rootlessness that defines a lot of young peoples\u2019 reality in the world today and, in some cases, has led them to be receptive to this terrorist message. I mean, this could present an opportunity for us, right? For\u2026 It does. I mean, it\u2019s like those little kids who are between Obama and Osama. I mean, the ones right now who are out in the streets of Cairo and Oman are hopeful that a democratic change is possible and that they can, for the first time in their lives, not only achieve some kind of modicum of economic security, but hopes for their political aspirations, whatever they may be, and they see this as an opportunity. And the United States, regretfully, is not seeing that, or at least not seeing it in their terms. They\u2019re seeing it through the old lenses of how the political structure of the world appeared to them on the eve of 9/11 or before. You have even talked about us being \u2014 not with regard to very recent events, but they may be an expression of it \u2014 talked about humanity being on the cusp of the second great tipping point in human history. Tell me what you mean by that, pulling the lens way back? Well, I sometimes see myself, you know, sort of among the ancient Maya or in ancient Sumaria when writing is first coming onto the scene. And if you think about writing, what it did. I mean, establishing words and records and memory for all time, augmenting the memory that human beings have, establishing things like contracts, making long-distance trade possible, even making things like the building of roads possible. And then you see what\u2019s happening in the world today in internet and Facebook and the media, and you realize that things like nations and libraries and the world as we have known it over the last 3,500 years is changing at an incredible pace. Now young people are beginning to \u2014 they\u2019re born into it now, so they grasp it right away and they\u2019re moving in a completely different space than us old geezers. And we\u2019re now seeing it has political power in a way. Yeah, but unfortunately, most of our political guys are still in a completely different world. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re in a world of, you know, buggies and carriages and horses. Then I hear them come out with their political proposals and it\u2019s like saying, \u201CWell, I have got a really good buggy stick\u2026 \u2026It\u2019s really the best one we can find.\u201D You ask yourself what is the relevance of a buggy stick in this new world? And I see the vast possibilities of this world, of a social brain. Just think about the networking possibilities of knowledge and access to knowledge that people have now. Yeah. I mean, again, people now in New Guinea can link up with what people in New York are doing and work together with their different experiences and lives and come up with new possibilities for human life. And this is happening at an incredibly fast rate and it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think our traditional political establishments are at all capable of dealing with and I think there will be huge upheavals as a result, economic and social. So you know, at the beginning of your book, which is called Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists, right before the table of contents, you have this absolutely beautiful picture of children. It looks like they\u2019re either coming out of school or going to school. They\u2019re beautiful children. It\u2019s kind of a heartbreaking picture in a lovely way. And then I read underneath that it\u2019s a school that you mentioned early on. You say, school\u2019s out at this school in Morocco from which five of the seven plotters of the Madrid train bombing who blew themselves up attended, as did several volunteers for martyrdom in Iraq. Tell me why you put that picture at the beginning of your book and what you would like a reader or someone coming to these ideas to see in that picture. Because those are the terrorists. Those are those who would be terrorists or would be us or our friends. And it is up to us and how we deal with the political world and the hopes and dreams that emerge in their own societies that will decide whether they go one way or the other. It\u2019s not, again, the fact that there are good or bad ideologies out there. It\u2019s not the fact of lack of presence of economic opportunities per se. It\u2019s whether there are paths in life that can lead them to something that\u2019s more congenial to the way we live in the world. I think we have many things to offer, but not in the way we\u2019re doing it. I mean, I\u2019m reminded very much of Maximilien Robespierre\u2019s statement to the Jacobin Club in the French Revolution, a statement he promptly forgot, which was, \u201CNo one loves armed missionaries.\u201D No one loves armed missionaries. No one loves the fact that we have troops out there in the world trying to preserve or push democracy or whatever. As Jefferson said, \u201CThe way we\u2019re going to change the world is by our example. Never, never can it be by the sword.\u201D Now sometimes you have to fight things. When people want to kill you, when people want to blow you up, then you have to fight them. There may be at the time no opportunity. But that\u2019s not the case with the vast majority of people who could possibly become tomorrow\u2019s terrorists. And that\u2019s where the fight for the world will be. It will be in the next generation of these young people, the ones caught between should we go the path of happiness as martyrdom or should we go to the path of yes, we can. They\u2019re both very enticing paths. I think one has a lot more to offer, but we have to show them it has more to offer, and we have to show them now. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for right now.
