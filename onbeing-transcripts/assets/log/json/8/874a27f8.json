  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CA Spirit of Defiance.\u201D My guest, Mariane Pearl, was married to The Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl, who was murdered by al-Qaeda operatives in Pakistan in 2002. A film based on her memoir, A Mighty Heart, opens in theaters this month. Daniel Pearl was killed, in part, because he was American and Jewish. Mariane Pearl, a Buddhist, speaks this hour about making sense of her husband\u2019s murder and her spiritual ethic on what she calls the \u201Cfrontlines of the war on terror.\u201D Danny and I were very, very aware of what was going on. I think Danny knew he could die. I think I knew he could die. And I think we both knew that, somehow, we had to oppose those people. So he did it in the face of death, and I did it in the face of life, you know? But it\u2019s the same defiance. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This month, a film based on Mariane Pearl\u2019s memoir, A Mighty Heart, opens in theaters nationwide. Her husband, Daniel Pearl, was murdered in Pakistan four months after September 11th. At that time, she was pregnant with their first child. In our 2004 conversation, Mariane Pearl spoke openly with me about her experience of human and spiritual dynamics on the frontlines of the war on terror. She says that years of Buddhist practice gave her the clarity to see what the terrorists\u2019 goals were and how to resist them, an ethic of compassion and defiance that sustains her even today. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CA Spirit of Defiance: Terrorism, Love, and Survival with Mariane Pearl.\u201D On January 23rd, 2002, in Karachi, Pakistan, Daniel Pearl went out to interview an elusive imam with suspected ties to Al Qaeda. He never returned home. The last time that Daniel Pearl was seen before he was abducted was outside this restaurant in Karachi. He came here to meet a contact and then simply disappeared. Weeks after his disappearance, Daniel Pearl\u2019s captors released a chilling videotape of his murder. They killed him, in part, because he was an American, a journalist, and a Jew. They killed a man, and that\u2019s who I lost. I didn\u2019t lose a symbol. I didn\u2019t lose a Jew. I didn\u2019t lose an American. You know, I lost Danny. So that\u2019s the blindness of terrorists. Mariane and Daniel Pearl had been married for three years. They were adventurous journalists committed to being agents for change. He was South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal. She was an award-winning documentary film producer and a former radio host in France. They came from disparate backgrounds. He was of Polish, Israeli, and Iraqi extraction. She is French and of Cuban, Dutch, Spanish, African, and Chinese descent. She\u2019s also a practicing Buddhist. Mariane and Daniel Pearl often discussed religion in the months prior to his abduction and murder. They reflected on the danger of religious extremism in the parts of the world they\u2019d come to inhabit. They also spoke often about the dangers and ethical perils created by poverty in that part of the world. In her book, A Mighty Heart: The Inside Story of the Al Qaeda Kidnapping of Danny Pearl, Mariane Pearl recalls one conversation a year before their last trip together to Karachi. She asked her husband which values he considered most essential. I was wondering whether he, having been born Jewish and having been educated also, did he really actually believe in God, and would he call himself a practicing Jewish. And he said, \u2018No, what I would call my, my strongest beliefs is ethics.\u2019 And I could say the same, even though I\u2019m a practicing Buddhist. Because I believe that, you know, it is \u2014 I think religion, for me, is a tool. It\u2019s not a mean, but a tool to be able to live up to your own beliefs. That\u2019s what I use it for. And I think that\u2019s what he meant. But he also said like, if something like a life-and-death situation would happen, then he would go to his own roots. To, to his Jewish roots? To his Jewish roots. He would explore that because that\u2019s the most natural thing for him. But in terms of a belief on which you ground your life, ethics was his answer. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s fascinating to me that his mother was an Iraqi Jew, that she was born in Baghdad of an ancient Jewish Iraqi family. Right. Right. Of course, what happened to you and your husband was set in a much larger context of terrorism and the war on terrorism. I felt, you know, that, for us, it was like we were at the crossroad of international geopolitics\u2026 Yeah. \u2026because of the situation in Palestine and Israel, and now in Iraq, but also, I mean, just with the Muslim world and America and Afghanistan, obviously. So I felt, yes, you know, here we have the Jewish element, and we have the American element, and then the Muslim element. And, really, that\u2019s like being at the center of the whole situation. And I think, you know, for Danny and I, that\u2019s why he said ethics, you know, because that was his way of approaching the world. He might have been Jewish, but that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t, as far as I saw, alter his approach to people. Like, he would not come as a Jewish person. He really came as a journalist. And what he put forward as, you know, his reason to meet the people or to do his job, really were journalistic reasons to do that. You know, he really, I think it\u2019s this whole role of transparency and truth and truth-telling, that\u2019s what mattered to him. So I think, also, for me, religion is something on which you act upon. And the fact that he died for that is still not something that make me change my mind. You know, the word ethics can sound a bit dry. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of generic meaning. You just used the words truth-telling, and truth and transparency. I mean, flesh that out for me a little bit more, what that word ethics meant for you and Danny in that place in which you found yourselves as journalists, but also as human beings. Well, it\u2019s very concrete. Yeah. It was very concrete because it really is about how we were going to conduct our daily life and our work. So, for instance, you know, one of the main challenges for journalists abroad would be toward the prejudices, your own prejudices. So, for instance, that was a constant battle to always double-check with yourself your opinion on things. And having this really demanding attitude, which was, you know, never take impressions for granted or people for granted and, you know, that kind of approach. It was very difficult in India or Pakistan because it\u2019s such a strong country, and that you have so many impressions. And you have so many prejudices. And you have so many clich\u00E9s, that to fight them, it has to be a very conscious effort. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s what I mean, for instance. And that was also an ethical act for you, was fighting your own prejudices as you encountered that new culture. Yeah. Yeah. It was the basics of it, yeah. It\u2019s really like a conduct, like on how you behave as a human being, as a professional. It really is about your interaction with the world. That\u2019s what I mean by ethics. In no way, for me, ethics is something, you know, like a general, broad, you know, system of value. It\u2019s really something that I walk on. It\u2019s really the ground on which I walk, yeah. So something else that really jumped out at me as you describe arriving in Pakistan is how very aware you were of poverty, of the condition of people. There is this scene where you meet, I believe, the servant of the woman you\u2019re staying with. And you say, \u201CShe was pregnant, but I dare not say \u2018like me'\u201D because you were aware that, that life of that child growing up would be quite different from the life of your child. Right. You know, the poverty in the world is, is something that I had, you know, seen before. But in this part of the world, especially in India, the scale of it, it was completely overwhelming to me. I found it interesting that you might live in Europe, for instance, or in America and completely ignore that whole, huge part of the world. And we\u2019re talking about a billion people in India. When you confront it every day, you know deep inside you that there\u2019s not going to be any world peace unless there\u2019s some kind of wealth distribution somehow because those people are also human beings. They don\u2019t have lesser needs than we do. If you\u2019re a journalist, you have to confront it. And when you confront it, you know, it\u2019s a very \u2014 for me, it was something very difficult to confront because, first of all, of course, I felt powerless, but also, I was angry. I was angry that I hadn\u2019t acknowledged that before. I had no idea of that reality. So that\u2019s something that really stayed with me. Journalist and author Mariane Pearl. She was married to The Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl, and was expecting their first child when he was kidnapped and murdered by Islamic extremists. In her memoir, A Mighty Heart, Mariane Pearl writes of her increasing awareness in Karachi of the human cost of poverty. Here\u2019s a reading from that book. \u201CAs I awaken, I struggle for the right words to describe this place. It is the curse of all journalists, I suppose, to be writing a story even as you are living it. \u2026 There are so many people in this city, but no one seems to know how to count them all. Are there ten million? Twelve? Fourteen? Most of Pakistan is landlocked, pressed between India and Afghanistan with parts of its borders touching southwestern Iran and the farthermost reaches of China. But Karachi, on the brown coast of the Arabian Sea, is the country\u2019s major port and, as such, is a magnet for migrants who drift in from the Pakistani countryside and across the border from even poorer places \u2014 Afghan villages, Bangladesh, the rural outposts of India. By day you see the poor burn under the scorching sun, selling vegetables and newspapers at dusty crossroads. At night they disappear in the labyrinthine streets, lending the city an air of foreboding. To us, this third-world city may glow with a feeble light, but Karachi draws the desperately poor like a torch draws fireflies.\u201D From Mariane Pearl\u2019s book, A Mighty Heart: The Inside Story of the Al Qaeda Kidnapping of Danny Pearl. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CA Spirit of Defiance,\u201D a conversation with Mariane Pearl on terrorism, love, and survival. She came face to face with the violence of Al Qaeda extremists even as, as a journalist, she was analyzing the social conditions that breed terrorism and extremism. I asked Mariane Pearl if she tried at the time to make sense of the larger context in which her husband died, not just who killed him, but what drove them. You know, he was killed by hatred. And to me, to put a label on that hatred, and not to know whether he was killed as an American, as a journalist, as a Jew, it doesn\u2019t matter so much. Whatever label you put on it doesn\u2019t change anything to me. It\u2019s not worse or better to have died because you were American or because you were Jewish. You know, both ways has no \u2014 this is not a reason to kill someone. So I am very suspicious of labels. And, you know, if they use that, I\u2019m certainly not\u2026 You mean the labels they put on him as reasons. On him. You know, they killed him as a symbol, right? Yeah. So symbolism is something I\u2019m very wary of. And, you know, they definitely used that to justify their action. For me, it\u2019s crap, you know? They killed a man. And that\u2019s why I wrote a book because \u2018OK, here\u2019s the reality. Here\u2019s the truth. That\u2019s the man you\u2019ve killed.\u2019 And that\u2019s something that is my reality. That\u2019s who I lost. I didn\u2019t lose a symbol. I didn\u2019t lose a Jew. I didn\u2019t lose an American. You know, I lost Danny. So that\u2019s the blindness of terrorists, you know, who, in front of their own people, justify action by saying, you know, \u2018This was the enemy,\u2019 which is a big lie. So, so for me, it\u2019s important to clearly state that, you know, there\u2019s no color on hatred. One reason is not better than the other. You quote a letter that a Pakistani journalist wrote to your friend Asra, that \u201CWe have a depressed society and all other avenues are closed. Only this avenue of violence is open.\u201D I\u2019m not asking you to excuse, whether you excuse the men who killed your husband. That would be a ridiculous question. But I wonder if your thoughts in trying to make sense of this, of how this could happen, if you do look at the larger context in which this happened, and find some reasons there for how this could happen. You know, I know that for a long time, that this can happen. I know it because, because it\u2019s enough to travel to know that. And it\u2019s enough to explore the world. You know, for instance, in the Arab world, once you are \u2014 I\u2019m pretty familiar with the Muslim world. And when I traveled on Nigeria or even Gaza Strip or Morocco, whatever, or Pakistan, you see thousands and thousands of young men who are frustrated in every way, including sexually, have no perspective, have no work, no hope, no nothing. You know something is going to happen. You know it\u2019s going to either implode or explode, but something is going to happen because they are human, and you know what human means. You can \u2014 you\u2019re not a cow. You can\u2019t just like stay there until you die. So this is actually common sense. So I knew that for a long time, and Danny knew it, too. I think, you know, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been very aware of for a very long time. And that\u2019s when I say, you know, it\u2019s time to maybe embrace the complexity of the world because it\u2019s not fair to just say, \u2018Oh, you know, they\u2019re just bad guys out there,\u2019 you know? There are a lot of those people who are involved in al-Qaeda operation are illiterate, young \u2014 you know, maybe they\u2019re 25 years old \u2014 completely desperate young men. But it is true that they have no access to education. They have no access to dream, period. They have no access to hope. Could you have thoughts like this in the midst of what was happening to you when Danny had disappeared and you didn\u2019t know whether he was alive or dead? Yes. You know, you can\u2019t change reality. I mean, it\u2019s something that anybody, whatever your beliefs are and your political inclinations are, everybody can see that. It\u2019s just common sense. And so it\u2019s just a matter of are you going to open your eyes or not. But if you are going to have some kind of honesty to the world, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s impossible. And if you have a knowledge of also the history of the region, then you understand. I think it\u2019s a pretty easy task to be a terrorist over there, you know? It\u2019s easy to recruit people because all the elements are there. And what you\u2019re saying is very straightforward, but I think it\u2019s pretty remarkable that you can say that having gone through what you\u2019ve gone through, having lost your husband to those dynamics. Mariane Pearl writes: \u201CAnother official-looking man in his mid-thirties, polite and smiling and dressed in a suit, summons me with a discrete gesture. He tells me he is from an acronym\u2019s police branch, and he asks for a photo of Danny \u2018for the needs of the inquiry.\u2019 We happen to have made identity photographs recently and I riffle through Danny\u2019s computer bag for his. When I pull it out, Danny\u2019s sweet and slightly ironic glance crosses mine and something suddenly starts screaming inside me. I experience an instant of pure panic. I feel a devastating urge to charge into the streets shouting his name, demanding that he be given back to me now. \u201C\u2026 The anger that rushes through me goes well beyond the hellish night I\u2019ve just lived through. In a flash, I feel a terrible bond not only with the victims of September 11th but also with the kids brainwashed to become instruments of death in the name of an invented Islam. The terrible absurdity of it all overwhelms me.\u201D From Mariane Pearl\u2019s memoir, A Mighty Heart. You, you were asking me about forgiveness. Yeah. Forgiveness, for me, is not so \u2014 it\u2019s not an incentive. Like, I have no incentive to forgive those people, and to a certain extent they, particularly those who made decisions are responsible for what they did, and they should probably die for it. So I\u2019m not forgiving them. And even though the situation is the way I described it, it doesn\u2019t mean that everybody goes into fundamentalism. And I think at some point, what they learned what to do in terrorist camps is to even \u2014 and there\u2019s no wisdom there. There\u2019s not any more logics. It\u2019s just passion, right? So in my own personal challenge, I am not interested in forgiving them, but I\u2019m interested in winning over them. And I think because I\u2019ve understood them and I have, and I\u2019ve seen them and I have faced them, I know them. And I know what I\u2019m facing, and I know how to, thus, I know how to, to challenge it. And what does it mean to win over them? What does that mean? Well, it means something very, very deep and very personal, but, you know, to give you an example, if I was somebody who could not trust people anymore because of what happened to Danny, then they would have claimed some part of my soul, I guess. You know? If I was overwhelmed by bitterness or if I hated Muslim, which is, you know, all, all of those are goals that they\u2019re trying to achieve by act of terrorism. When they kill a target, whether it is 3,000 people or one person, like Danny, it\u2019s the same goal. It\u2019s like, you know, it\u2019s not about the people who they kill, it\u2019s about the people who relate to them. So because what they\u2019re trying to achieve through act of terrorism is so clear to me, so clear that I was able to stand up against those goals each time they did it. And that\u2019s what gave me the strength. I knew that if, you know, if I was going to be bitter, I was going to be half dead, and that\u2019s exactly what they wanted, right? I can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s impossible. But it\u2019s a defiance. It\u2019s not a forgiveness. I have no reason to forgive them. You know, defiance is not a Buddhist term, but I do sense your, I do sense a sort of fierce Buddhist practice\u2026 I\u2019m a fierce Buddhist, right? \u2026running beneath that. No, Buddhism, I think, you know, there\u2019s 84,000 teachings actually in Buddhism, so it\u2019s, you know, I guess, and I don\u2019t know them all, at all. I\u2019m not a specialist. I know the one I practice. For instance, here\u2019s a tool. When I, you know, when I feel \u2014 I have a legitimate feelings of, for instance, you know, anger, I chant to, to overcome that anger. But it\u2019s more of a determination than a prayer in a way. But I use the force of Buddhism, like whatever He brings me, whatever He awakes in me, to achieve my goals. You know, I don\u2019t look in the texts to see whether it\u2019s a Buddhist attitude or not, you know? I just \u2014 what I do is to be as honest and sincere with myself as I can be. And that really works with Buddhism. And, you know, I like it that it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a philosophy that has this moral on what is good. You don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad, you know? It\u2019s more like what\u2019s value-creating and what\u2019s, what isn\u2019t. So, for instance, it is a Buddhist victory for me to, I mean, that I relate to Buddhism the fact that I can live, for instance, you know? That I can love after all that, and that I can understand, for instance, the \u2014 in Pakistan, I chanted, obviously, to try to save Danny, and I think what Buddhism brought me at that time was a very strong insight into what\u2019s, what was going on. I think Danny and I were very, very aware of what was going on, I think. In that place? Yes. I think we were in the same mind frame. I think Danny knew he could die. I think I knew he could die. And I think we both knew that somehow we had to oppose those people. And he did it in the face of death, and he did it through gestures and, you know, in the photos, there were photos of him. And you can see him giving the fingers or showing the \u201CV\u201D for \u201Cvictory,\u201D you know? And he did what he could. And some sentences that he, that he said also in the video that was going to document his murder. So he did it in the face of death and I did it in the face of life, you know? But it\u2019s the same defiance. From Mariane Pearl\u2019s memoir, A Mighty Heart: \u201CTo the end, he fought back. In the video, my friends tell me, Danny says, \u2018My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.\u2019 Yes, I\u2019m sure they made him say that. \u201C\u2026 But here is how I know Danny was undefeated to the end: He says on the video, \u2018In the town of Benei Beraq in Israel there\u2019s a street called Chaim Pearl Street, which is named after my great-grandfather, who was one of the founders of the town.\u2019 \u201CThis was not a piece of information his captors could have known or forced Danny to utter before the cameras for their propaganda purposes. The choice of those words and the decision to say them was pure Danny Pearl, his own act of defiance, essentially saying, \u2018If you are going to kill me for who I am, then do it, but you won\u2019t have me.\u2019 Danny said this for me and for our son and for his parents. He said it so we\u2019d know. So we would be proud, so we would go on. His words about the past created a future.\u201D This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, Mariane Pearl\u2019s stories of the Pakistani policeman who helped her through her ordeal, and the human face they put on the war on terror. The interesting part was that we ended up being two Jewish people, one Buddhist, two Catholic, and two Muslim. So that\u2019s where we were. And so I think the reason why people became so deeply involved was that it was almost like two visions of the world were fighting each other. Also ahead in our conversation, the birth of her son, Adam. Many times we can\u2019t fit all of my conversation into the radio broadcast. Here\u2019s your chance to hear what was cut.

Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CA Spirit of Defiance.\u201D My intimate 2004 conversation with author and journalist Mariane Pearl. Her story is dramatized in a new movie starring Angelina Jolie. The kidnapping and murder of Mariane Pearl\u2019s husband, Daniel Pearl, in 2002 in Karachi is a source of continued international speculation. Pakistani authorities convicted four men for the crime. One, Omar Sheikh, was given the death penalty, which he has appealed. In March of this year, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al-Qaeda\u2019s third in command who is now in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay, confessed to Daniel Pearl\u2019s murder. Mariane Pearl is a French journalist of Cuban and Dutch extraction, and a practicing Buddhist. Terrorists beheaded her husband and sent a videotape of that act around the world. But Pearl says they didn\u2019t win. In her memoir, she devotes great detail to the courage of the Pakistani security officers who fought to find her husband and save his life. She later told President George W. Bush that these men have barely functioning transportation and communications. Yet, they are on the front lines of the war on terrorism. I found this such an important part of your story. There\u2019s captain, this Pakistani\u2026 Right. Was he a police officer? He\u2019s a, he\u2019s an anti-terrorist\u2026 OK. \u2026person. So he\u2019s from the police, some special unit. But he\u2019s from the police corps, yeah. And you sort of refer to him with great respect and affection as \u201CCaptain.\u201D Yes, I respect him a lot, yeah. And he\u2019s really another face of that part of the world and this struggle that we\u2019re engaged in together. Yeah. See, he puts a human face to what I was telling you earlier, which is\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s not about Islam, it\u2019s not about Muslim, it\u2019s not about even Pakistani, you know? This is not it, like, you know, people claim those elements or features. It\u2019s just a hijacking. And if you see the people, the Muslim people, how, first of all, they\u2019ve been suffering from terrorism in that part of the world is the Shi\u2019a-Sunni killings. But also you see how \u2014 like can you imagine \u2014 I don\u2019t know which, which is your religion, but if someone claims to be of your religion to kill someone, it\u2019s horrible. They\u2019re taking your beliefs and they\u2019re making them, you know, something that destroys. It\u2019s about hatred. It\u2019s very difficult to deal with. And that\u2019s something that Captain had, so \u2014 that\u2019s why I knew he was going to fight so hard against those people because he was personally attacked as a Muslim. Describe him \u2014 for someone who hasn\u2019t read the book, describe who he was and what role he played in your experience. He\u2019s a man who had been in the army for a long time. That\u2019s why I nicknamed him Captain, even though it sounds like a lower grade than he was. But then he started fighting terrorists. And he had been involved in the Shi\u2019a killings in, in Pakistan. And, and that\u2019s a horrible story because even in the time I was there 11 doctors were killed. They were killing doctors, Shi\u2019a doctors. So 11 doctors, that\u2019s a lot of people, and just targeted killing. So he had been dealing with that. He\u2019d been working on that, those cases? Yes, he\u2019d been working on those cases, so he had to know a lot of broken families and people that died for nothing. I mean, killing a doctor, I mean, how, you know, more ruthless can you be? That\u2019s just because they\u2019re curing other people, you know, other Shi\u2019a, whatever. But he\u2019s also \u2014 he\u2019s a man, he\u2019s a Muslim and he\u2019s a practicing Muslim and one of the most noble men I\u2019ve ever met in my life. To me, he has all the beauty of Islam in him in what he brings to the people. I\u2019ve seen, you know, people like him in other countries, in other parts of the world. What, what do you think of when you say that one, that phrase, the beauty of Islam? It\u2019s just that he\u2019s a man who has very high principles, and those principles are brought to him by his religion. And he lives up to them, and that\u2019s what matters to him. So that makes beautiful people, because it\u2019s not only something out of yourself or, you know, just like the, the system in which you have been brought or whatever. It\u2019s something you have chosen for your own life. So when, when the time came, for instance, for Captain to decide whether he really should risk his life to save Danny, that\u2019s what, you know, went into his mind. He\u2019s like, \u2018As a Muslim, I have to do that.\u2019 You know, \u2018This man is innocent, I have to save him.\u2019 I wonder if you could take us inside that house in Pakistan as you\u2019ve learned that Danny had died. Tell me what happened and where this wonderful spiritual balance that you have. Was that with you in that moment? Well, I think, and I said earlier, what the real benefit of having practiced and chanted at that moment, I think was that I was so clear on what was going on. This is a time where I didn\u2019t think about myself at all. For the first time, I thought, \u2018OK, the reality is, like, one of us made it, and the other one didn\u2019t.\u2019 So that\u2019s \u2014 I had to confront that, but otherwise I was so clear on who killed Danny and why they killed Danny, and what I had to do to oppose that. That\u2019s what saved my life, I think. It was a time where if I was going to live on because at some point, you know, we\u2019re going to forget or get over it, I don\u2019t think I would have done anything like that. Was it your friend and protector, Captain, who gave you the news when they finally learned\u2026 Yes. Yes. Yes. And I, I know it was very striking how broken-hearted he was and all the people, all the police officers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was a very strange thing to see all these tough guys, because they are very tough guys, and obviously they\u2019re fighting tough guys, too, so they are very trained and very, you know, emotionally and physically and \u2014 but they were all crying because they had involved themselves so much, and because Danny was dead and because they like me, and they were, felt real kinship, I think, with me and with Adam. And I think they did that because they thought I was very courageous, and that gave them a lot of hope, I think. So that\u2019s, that was my role in this house, and, yeah. To give everyone else hope? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It would have been different if I had been, you know, it may be difficult to convey, but that\u2019s what Buddhism brought me at that moment. I mean, I could face what happened, and if I have to have someone who were, who was more \u2014 had more, less defenses, it would have been a completely different story. We led a war. It was a war, but that was possible because of me and \u2014 it\u2019s not really me, but it was faith at that moment. And Buddhism, I think, one of the big aspects of Buddhism is wisdom, is insight. That\u2019s what it brings you. So I really needed that at the time. Journalist Mariane Pearl. Here\u2019s a reading from her memoir. \u201COn our last night I invite over all the men who helped me look for Danny. Randall snags beer and bad wine for the non-Muslims and the non-pregnant from the U.S. consulate commissary. \u201C\u2026 We gather in a circle, and for a while we sit in silence. \u201C\u2026 Finally, I find my voice. \u2018You are the bravest men I have ever met. You went straight to hell, where darkness is the deepest, because you hate injustice, and racism, and tyranny. You did it for Danny and for me and for our child. But you also did it on behalf of the rest of the world. You are on the front lines of the fight against terrorism, and still, nobody knows you and how brave you are. Nobody sees how your willingness to fight the darkest threat for humanity actually makes each one of you shine as an individual.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, today in conversation with journalist Mariane Pearl. The security officials who supported her during the ordeal of her husband\u2019s kidnapping in Pakistan were joined by friends and family from several countries. For five weeks before Daniel Pearl\u2019s body was discovered, they formed a community in the house where she was staying, watching, searching, and praying around the clock. Looking back, Mariane Pearl sees in that mix of humanity an alternative to the terrorists\u2019 vision of the world. The interesting part was that we ended up being two Jewish people, one Buddhist, two Catholic, and two Muslims. So that\u2019s where we were. So I think the reason why people became so deeply involved was that it was almost like two visions of the world were fighting each other. And in one hand, there were the people who held Danny captive and had some fascism, you know, as a vision for the future, and we were the world. And, so it was almost two ideologies fighting each other. And I think everybody just threw themselves in this battle because of its almost symbolic value. We could not let those guys win. That cannot be the future of the world. And everybody, I think, at some point was ready to die for that. You know, I\u2019m sure someone would hear the description you just gave of these two worlds, the terrorists who were holding your husband and who killed him, and then this world of people fighting that. And they would say that they won, that the bad guys won. But that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not what comes through your book. I mean, how do you explain that way you came out of this? For me they clearly haven\u2019t won as I\u2019m still standing, because to take somebody\u2019s life is nothing, you know? If you have seven, eight people in a room and the person has shackle and you kill him, you know, then that\u2019s not a victory. And there is something bigger than that, and the spirit is what makes us human. And that\u2019s the only way you can challenge those people because, physically, I could never be as ruthless as they are, and I\u2019m not interested in being as ruthless as they are. So that\u2019s not even something I\u2019m considering. But you cannot get hold of a strong spirit, and I think that\u2019s why Danny opposed them. That\u2019s why I oppose them, and that\u2019s why hopefully our son will oppose them. And that\u2019s something, whatever you do, you can imprison someone, you can kill that person, if they resist you mentally, you \u2014 that\u2019s it. You haven\u2019t claimed anything. And I think they know that. You mentioned your son just now, and we haven\u2019t even talked about the fact that when you were going through this you were pregnant. And I have to say, for me, reading the book, it seemed like such a miraculous and necessary part of this story \u2014 that you had a part of Danny inside you, right, that you then brought into the world after he died. Mm-hmm. I received some letters saying that he was the Messiah or, you know, the son of Jesus. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s a, he\u2019s a child, and I think he really is the best of us. I\u2019m more and more confident about this fact. And he\u2019s, he represents victory, I think, also, that\u2019s concrete element because, you know, he could have died pretty easily just because of the stress and because of what we went through. And bringing him into the world in good health was one of my concrete, when \u2014 it\u2019s a manifestation as a result of my determination not to let those people win. But if I was going to bring him into the world, I was going to bring him happiness. I was not going to bring a kid to which I had no hope to offer. So that was very clear to me. So it meant that I have to win my fight. Could you tell this story that you tell in the book about just how you spent the couple of days before you went into labor? Well, it was just a very difficult time because we had found Danny\u2019s body in Pakistan and a lot of details about what happened to him, and it was very graphic, and it was very horrible, very ruthless. And I was finding that out. And I found things out just by chance, in a way, because I was trying not to read e-mails and not to, I mean, trying to concentrate on the birth. But I did find some e-mails and, and read about it. So I realized the violence is something that terrorists use as a tool. Violence is made to terrify you. You know, it\u2019s a very concrete cold-minded thing. So the more violent it can be, the more they have power over you because you can\u2019t beat them. So I knew that violence was meant for us to be paralyzed. I was worried because I had never had a child and I knew that birth is something that kind of overwhelms you and all kinds of feelings can appear or things like that. So I knew that the violence, you know, that\u2019s when I had to confront the violence before I gave birth, because if I didn\u2019t do that then it would have some power over me. It might be too much or it might be paralyzing me or taking strength away from me. So I did that. And I isolated myself, and I thought about everything that I had to think about, and, you know, I\u2019m not going to say more than what I said in the book because part of it\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is very personal and belongs to me, but\u2026 You really thought about what you knew concretely about what had happened? Yeah. I confronted the violence, you know? And I thought about that, and I thought about, you know, everything that I needed to think about. And I did it, but I did it, again, in a spirit of defiance, like it was something that was the ultimate thing they could make me collapse with, you know, the amount of violence that Danny was confronted with. One thing that really helped me was that he died pretty fast, and he doesn\u2019t know what happened afterwards. So that\u2019s something that helps. And I was so close to him that somehow for me it was like, you know, once we\u2019re dead, we\u2019re dead, and, you know, the rest is for us to be traumatized. It\u2019s done for us. So I needed to do that, and I did it. I isolated myself for two days, and I did that. And then you went into labor. Yeah. But at the end of that, those two days, I, you know, I knew it was going to be OK, and I was going to be fine. And do you still feel that way now? Was it the cathartic experience that you wanted it to be? Did you really get that out? Yes and no. I mean, sometimes it comes back to you, and that\u2019s something to deal with. But I was not trying to get over it, because there was no way to get over it. I was trying to not let them win, you know? And letting them win was \u2014 would be anything from having a very difficult labor to Adam not making it. So I was, I was fighting. I was not trying to heal. And I think I\u2019m still in that same mood. Journalist Mariane Pearl. Her son was born nearly four months after his father\u2019s death, but early in the pregnancy, Daniel Pearl had already chosen the baby\u2019s name, Adam. He would be, Pearl said, a universal baby. Adam is \u2014 in his veins, he has blood from Iraq and from Poland, from Israel, from Holland, from Cuba. That\u2019s our four origins. And then, you know, his father\u2019s American, and I\u2019m French. And he was conceived in Bombay. And so the whole world is in this little kid, little child. And, you know \u2014 and it was wishful thinking that, hopefully, that would be the people it the 21st century that, you know, they can live with all this cultures and origins. It would sit inside them and just be beautiful. It seems like he\u2019s, he is a physical embodiment of that, that parallel world you described in your house in Pakistan\u2026 Right. Exactly. Yeah. \u2026all those people countering\u2026 Right. \u2026that world of terrorism. Right. Exactly. Tell me about Adam. What\u2019s he like? He\u2019s very \u2014 he\u2019s, he\u2019s adorable. I\u2019m really not objective, but\u2026 No, he looks adorable. I saw his picture. He\u2019s very, he\u2019s very nice. He\u2019s a very caring and loving and funny little child. He\u2019s a good traveler, obviously. And he\u2019s, he\u2019s very joyful. He\u2019s a very joyful kid. Hmm. I know you worried so much, which any \u2014 I mean, mothers worry, pregnant women worry about everything, and then you were going through this huge trauma of how this would all be affecting him, what you were going through. I mean, do you still think about that as you watch him grow? People were more worried than I was. I think a lot of people around me were completely so scared that he would be everything. And I wasn\u2019t scared because to me, it felt like we\u2019re either going to make it or not. But just during this whole time, we were \u2014 it felt to me like we were one entity. So I was not making any separation between me and Adam at that time, because it was just such a life-and-death situation. So that\u2019s something very difficult to communicate, but I did \u2014 he was always, for me, like as I wrote in the book, I trusted him, and I don\u2019t know how you can trust a fetus, you know? But I did. I really did. I felt like, you know, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t have to worry about him.\u2019 Or if I had, then it\u2019s about all of us. It\u2019s about the three of us. So to me, he was just part of us, and he was exactly in the same fate. He was more actually a reassuring presence than he was a person I was worried about. People panicked around me, that\u2019s for sure. They really wanted, like, a doctor to come. And I knew that, you know, it was, it was deeper than that. We \u2014 it was a deeper battle than, you know, than regular worries that people have. Same thing when, when I gave birth and people told me about the baby blues, you know, you know? \u2018Sure. You know, I have the baby blues, whatever.\u2019 You know, it\u2019s, it was much deeper than that. So, the only thing for me is, you know, I\u2019m going to have to tell him the story, so I\u2019m going to have to, to find the words. Yeah. And, and I will. So, when you think of him growing as an individual, as a third person, then, you know, you have to just see how we\u2019re going to deal with the situation. But it\u2019s his fate; it\u2019s his story, too. And I don\u2019t know, I think he\u2019s going to have a strong sense of his father. You published your memoir really pretty quickly after the events, and I wonder if just at this remove of months, is there anything as you\u2019ve continued to live with this and make sense of it that you think you might have written differently or included? Not at all. I have absolutely no regret. There are things I haven\u2019t written about and I could write about, but the purpose of this book was to, to just give my experience, tell the story from my point of view. And I did exactly that. And I just went back step by step to everything that we went through and, and with no \u2014 I didn\u2019t step back. I didn\u2019t interview anybody. I just told my experience. And I needed to do that for Adam, just that he knows the truth. What I\u2019m going to tell him 10 years from now will have 10 years of, you know, distance and, and our lives will be different. I needed him to know exactly what happened, and that\u2019s exactly what I wrote, not a word more than that \u2014 or less. Mariane Pearl speaking of her memoir, A Mighty Heart: The Inside Story of the Al Qaeda Kidnapping of Danny Pearl. The book included excerpts from dozens of letters she and her son received from around the world. \u201CAfter this excruciating ordeal,\u201D she wrote, \u201Cthere was nothing I needed more than to be reassured about human nature.\u201D Here are readings from some of those letters. \u201CThough you don\u2019t know us, we are deeply grieved by your loss and feel as if we have lost someone from our own family. Take courage, for something good, however small, will always come out of such a tragedy, or so I believe. With deep regret for your loss and prayers for Danny, Zarina Mehta, Bombay, India.\u201D \u201CDear Mrs. Pearl, The enclosed money order was purchased with donations made by friends, family and customers of Deegan\u2019s Liquor Store in Woodhaven, New York. We were touched by you and your husband\u2019s story, and we hope this relatively small contribution can help out with some baby expenses. Best wishes, Elizabeth Deegan, Woodhaven, New York.\u201D \u201CDear Mrs. Pearl and family, I would like to offer my condolences on the untimely death of Mr. Pearl. May he rest in peace. As a Pakistani, I am ashamed of being one today. His unborn son will come into this world hating us, but is he not justified to hate us? I have no words to say how sorry I am for what happened to Danny. My heart goes out for your family. Danny died for a great cause, and he is a martyr. I had hoped for him all along and now console myself knowing he is happy up there with his creator and looking down and smiling and longing to see his beautiful unborn son. He will be your guardian angel. People like Danny make this world worth living in. May he rest in peace, and God give you the strength you need. Sultan, Sara, Ryaan, and Raniya.\u201D I asked Mariane Pearl what such letters meant to her. Well, one of them is, is a lady \u2014 an older lady from Syracuse, New York, who sent me a $10 check, and I\u2019ve kept that check, actually. I have to confess I never cashed it because she\u2019s \u2014 for me, she represents the number of people who, who just expressed everything they could to, to help and an amazing empathy. So from that kind of people to a man that is on a death row, for instance, in Pakistan for blasphemy, you know? And he is going to die, and still he thinks that it\u2019s important that he communicate, you know, his solidarity to us. And he\u2019s worried that we have the wrong impression of Islam. And to me, now it feels like a lot of those letters were written with, like, real soul. There was no personal interest there. There was just a real solidarity. And to me, they\u2019re very important, those letters, because I think, you know, we were talking about Adam, and I think, you know, he\u2019s going to have to confront like a story of absolute darkness, because that\u2019s exactly what those guys are. But on the other hand, you know, you can only oppose light to darkness, and that light is those letters. I mean, those letters, that\u2019s what they represent for me because to that, he can only, you know, light, and, and the only light we have is the light of our humanism, right? And that\u2019s what they express. Whoever they come from, you know, they can, you know \u2014 some people are very known; some people are not well known. Right. There are several presidents in there, but there are also just average people. Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s not like \u2014 there\u2019s less chance, maybe, that a president will be sincere, you know? And I published those I thought were sincere. But, you know, it comes down to \u2014 because it\u2019s about life and death and the death of an innocent man to humanism. You know, there\u2019s something common to all of us we can all express, and they have those people. And for Adam, they are, I think, going to be the balance that will make the world a possible place to live. Mariane Pearl lives in Paris.
