  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, for the first time, we feature a wide-ranging conversation I had with child psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Coles in his Boston living room in the year 2000. He says that our children can teach us about living searchingly and gracefully even in hardship if we will let them. We explore what he\u2019s learned across a lifetime of listening to children and how that\u2019s formed his sense of the deepest meaning of religion and of humanity at every age. The spirit of religion I think is what children connect with: the questions, the inquiry, the enormous curiosity about this universe, and the hope that somehow those answers will come about. This is Speaking of Faith. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippet. In the early days of Speaking of Faith, I sat down for a wide-ranging conversation with Harvard psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Coles in the living room of his Boston home. He is best known for his unparalleled research on the inner lives of children. This year my producers and I listened again to that interview with Robert Coles, most of which had never been aired, and we found it enduringly resonant. It was a different world in which I spoke with him: the summer of 2000, a period of relative peace and prosperity in the U.S. Yet one of the strongest points Robert Coles made with me then was that we err when we try to create an illusion of a perfect world for ourselves and our children. They are witnesses to the fullness of our humanity. They are keenly attuned to the darkness as well as the light of life, and they can teach us about living honestly, searchingly, and courageously if we let them. They may be brought up in a secular world, but they have deep inner sides to them that are non-secular in nature, which have to do with eternal questions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. You might call them verity and evil or whatever, but children do come up with that, amazingly, while they\u2019re witnessing it. And they\u2019re holding on to it and they\u2019re asking why and they\u2019re wondering about things. And that is a very important part of childhood and maybe an important part of all of our lives. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Inner Lives of Children: A Conversation with Robert Coles.\u201D Robert Coles found his personal calling in a crucible of American social change. One day in 1960, as a young psychiatrist working in New Orleans, he happened to drive by crowds of adults heckling a first-grader, Ruby Bridges. She was one of four children to integrate New Orleans public schools and the only black child to enter the William Frantz Elementary School that year. Robert Coles was stunned by the evident dignity and apparent wisdom with which she comported herself. \u201CHad I not been right there,\u201D he wrote later, \u201CI might\u2019ve pursued a different life.\u201D But Robert Coles got to know Ruby Bridges and her family, and over the next two decades he listened to children all over the world. He wrote books about the psychological, political, and moral lives of children. In 1973, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his series \u201CChildren of Crisis.\u201D Then one day late in his career, Robert Coles\u2019s friend Anna Freud suggested that he might look back at all his research and see if there was anything he\u2019d missed. And he found, to his surprise, that his notes were full of religious and spiritual observations from children, insights he\u2019d largely ignored for the sake of academic respectability. Those observations were the impetus for his 1990 classic work, The Spiritual Life of Children. Robert Coles\u2019s own formative religious background was confusing, as he put it to me when we began to speak. His mother was a devout Episcopalian from the Midwest. His father was a half-Catholic, half-Jewish Englishman. He was a scientist and an atheist, though in the years of Robert Coles\u2019s childhood, his father\u2019s Jewish identity was coming painfully into relief with the rise of fascism in Europe. My father would drive us to church. He\u2019d sit and read the newspaper. He wouldn\u2019t go into the church. He\u2019d read the Sunday Times and then we\u2019d come out and he\u2019d ask my brother and me what we learned. Interesting verb. And I wonder \u2014 I remember asking my mother, I must\u2019ve been seven or eight years old, \u201CWhy doesn\u2019t Daddy come into church?\u201D She said, \u201CWell, your father doesn\u2019t believe in what he would hear here.\u201D So when she said that, that was an invitation to me to be skeptical. OK. Because, you know, I was his son and I very much looked up to him. So I want to know why doesn\u2019t Daddy believe this, and that got the whole thing going, because he explained to me that what he believed in is understanding predictability through science and all its achievements. So I distinctly remember in the sixth grade, that would make me 10 years old, understanding the position of the agnostic skeptic as well as the faithful believer. I had it in my bones and I had it in family experience. And very important, what I had was my mother and father, memories of my parents talking to one another out loud so that my brother and I could hear and understand their different points of view. And I remember my mother telling me, oh, do I remember this, I remember my mother telling me that when I heard people saying things that were anti-Semitic or slurring against Jewish people or toward any people, I remember her saying hate is a sin. And then of course she reminded us that Jesus was a Jew. In fact, what she said then, even now I can remember, she said he had the courage to believe and to stand up for his beliefs and even to die for his beliefs. And that rebellious side of Jesus I think my mother held onto with great passion. And I think it\u2019s tragic in a way that all too many of us allow ourselves to become so conventionally religious that we lose that, shall I say, skeptical, rebellious, questioning side to religion. Right. Which I think is what I\u2019m trying to say here as I speak with you, as I go back to my parents and to my childhood and try to recapture some of that spirit that I knew as a boy. It\u2019s interesting to me that those words you used, \u201Cquestioning spirit,\u201D and not a conventional religious sense are also qualities that you found in children and even in children who came from homes in which the tradition was much more set. That\u2019s a very good point you\u2019ve just brought up. Children are by nature questioning. I mean, I know it as a pediatrician and a child psychiatrist. I know it as a parent. I think we all know that children are questioning. And I think there is no doubt that a lot of the religious side of childhood is a merger of the natural curiosity and interest the children have in the world with the natural interest and curiosity that religion has about the world, because that\u2019s what religion is. Right. It\u2019s our effort in this planet as creatures who have a mind and use language to ask questions and answer them through speculation, through story-telling, to explore the universe and answer those fundamental questions: Where do we come from? What are we? And where, if any place, are we going? And those fundamental questions inform religious life and inform the lives of children as children, and that merger is a beautiful thing to behold when you\u2019re with children. You know what\u2019s nice about what you just said to me too, is I suddenly realized that what you discovered in speaking with these children and listening to them is not only revealing about childhood but it\u2019s revealing of an aspect of religion which we probably don\u2019t pay as much attention to as we should. That\u2019s the great tragedy, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. Because after all, if you stop and think about Judaism, the great figures in Judaism are those prophets of Israel, Jeremiah and Isaiah and Amos. They were prophetic figures who asked the deepest kinds of questions and were willing to stand outside the gates of power and privilege in order to keep asking those questions. And then came Jesus of Nazareth who was a teacher. You might call him the migrant teacher who walked about ancient Israel \u2014 now called Israel, Palestine, whatever, the Middle East \u2014 seeking and asking and wondering and reaching out to people and daring to ask questions that others had been taught not to ask or even forbidden to ask. And this kind of inquiring Jesus, this soulful Jesus, searching for comrades and, let\u2019s call them in our vernacular, buddies. They were his buddies, and they were willing to link arms with him in this kind of spiritual quest that he found himself, shall we say, impelled toward or driven toward. I don\u2019t want to use driven in any psychoanalytic way \u2026 Right. \u2026 but just in a human way. And this was the rabbi, the teacher, the exalted figure, a descendant, really, of Jeremiah and Isaiah and Amos. It\u2019s that prophetic tradition of Judaism which is so profound and important and which the Christian world is, at its best, the beneficiary of. Right. Now, both in Judaism and Christianity, of course, there are rule setters, and at times they can be all too insistent, some would say even a bit tyrannical. But in any event, the spirit or religion, I think, is what children connect with. Right. The questions, the inquiry, the enormous curiosity about this universe, and the hope that somehow those answers will come about, which is what we do when we kneel in a church and sit and pray in a synagogue or whatever. Also what I think you\u2019re getting at there and what is also in this compatibility between children and religion also has something to do with, I mean, there\u2019s something mysterious in it as well, something about the mystery of those questions. Mystery is such an important part of it. And mystery invites curiosity and inquiry. You know, Flannery O\u2019Connor \u2014 talk about a religious person, she was Catholic in background but she was beyond Catholicism; she was a deeply spiritual person. And she once was talking about the kind of person who becomes a good novelist, hoping that she would be included in that company but not daring to assume that that had happened. But once she said, beautifully \u2014 it\u2019s in her letters if the listeners want to get one of her books. It\u2019s called, The Habit of Being \u2014 but in one of those letters she says, \u201CThe task of the novelist is to deepen mystery.\u201D And then she pauses and she says, \u201CBut mystery is a great embarrassment to the modern mind.\u201D And there\u2019s our tragedy, that we have to resolve all mystery. We can\u2019t let it be. We can\u2019t rejoice in it. We can\u2019t celebrate it. We can\u2019t affirm it as an aspect of our lives because, after all, mystery is an aspect of our lives. We come out of nowhere, don\u2019t we, in the sense that we\u2019re a total accident. Our parents met. There\u2019s the accident. And, you know, we\u2019re born. Obviously, we come from someplace physiologically. And then comes the emergence of our being, which is the psychological and spiritual emergence of our being that takes time, experience, education of a certain kind with parents and neighbors and teachers and relatives and from one another humanly. And this slow emergence of our psychological being and our spiritual being is itself a great mystery. And mystery, you bet \u2014 mystery is a great challenge. It\u2019s an invitation, and it\u2019s a wonderful companion, actually. Child psychiatrist and author Robert Coles. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Inner Lives of Children: A Conversation with Robert Coles.\u201D Let me ask you about something that intrigues me in your work and also in other kinds of work around children and around their spiritual lives in particular, that this curiosity and this ability to connect with the mystery and to be wise about it in a way, seems to be there in very young children and in many kinds of children in many circumstances, both good and bad. And then there comes an age, which might be nine or 12 where, again, sort of in many kinds of children in many circumstances, they become more like us, like adults. How do you make sense of that? Are children somehow born closer to God? I mean, that\u2019s one way some people would say it. In all the work you have done, how would you describe what\u2019s happening? Well, that\u2019s a question not only about spirituality, but maybe psychology too, because I know from my own experiences as a parent and now as a grandparent, I have two grandsons and I watch them and I see their spontaneity, their curiosity, let me even call it their delving spirit. They\u2019re probing. They want to know. Almost physically they poke around and explore and touch things. They want to know. They want to understand. They\u2019re yearning. This is just part of their being. And if they lose that at home and school, this, of course, and in the neighborhood, this can be a tragedy. But I think insofar as that curiosity is allowed to flourish and is encouraged \u2014 not encouraged ritualistically or compulsively, but just celebrated and enjoyed by the adult world \u2014 this brings them toward religion. Because I know children. I\u2019ve taught in a Sunday school, and the children ask me, for instance, \u201CWhy are you teaching?\u201D and I say, \u201CWell, I\u2019m teaching so I can learn from you about God.\u201D \u201CWell, I don\u2019t know anything about God,\u201D they\u2019ll say. \u201CWell, what do you know,\u201D I say, \u201Cabout God?\u201D \u201CWell, I know that God created the world.\u201D How did he do that?\u201D Other children ask; this isn\u2019t me as a teacher in Sunday school. \u201CWell, he decided he wanted company.\u201D Listen to that, I heard from one girl. She said, \u201CHe decided he wanted company.\u201D \u201CWell, why did he want company?\u201D \u201CHe just wanted some people around him that he could talk with and learn from,\u201D she said. I was stunned. If that isn\u2019t the whole existentialist tradition, I don\u2019t know what is. And she had it right there in the palm of her hand. God\u2019s search for meaning, which is what some of the existentialists, philosophically sophisticated writers have told us, but she was just being natural, intuitive, human, and attributing to God her own, of course, search for understanding and companionship and a meeting of minds. It\u2019s wonderful to be in a classroom sponsored by a church or a synagogue and realize that there it is. Children and the prophets of Israel and Jesus of Nazareth all and his buddies, if I may use that word again, searching for answers about what are we doing here and how should we spend our time here? What\u2019s important? Right. And these children know this out of their humanity. They\u2019re trying to figure out what the world is like. And they\u2019re trying to figure out, among other things, their own parents. In fact, one boy said to me, \u201CYou know, my parents worry a lot.\u201D So I said, \u201COh?\u201D He said, \u201CWell, they\u2019re always worrying about everything.\u201D And then he brought up the questions of money and education, but he said, \u201CI think that they\u2019re just worrying that they should really stay around and be with us.\u201D So I thought that was interesting. I said, \u201CIs there any reason, do you think, that they\u2019re worried about that?\u201D He said, \u201CMy father lost his brother.\u201D And this just became a poignant story about frailty and loss. \u201CAfter my father\u2019s brother died, my father became more religious,\u201D this boy said to me. And then I realized, there he\u2019s making that eternal connection between suffering and loss and vulnerability and faith, or the search for faith, or the search for meaning, especially if you\u2019ve been hurt or you\u2019ve lost someone. Well, now, there\u2019s that mystery again too, I think. There\u2019s that mystery. There\u2019s something that children have that also adults sometimes grasp in the midst of suffering or when they face death. And suffering is both mystery and common human experience, isn\u2019t it? And religion is there to help us ponder suffering and its significance to us and, indeed, even redemption. Redemption means that out of suffering can come strength, understanding, reflection. And that same boy that I just mentioned, he said, \u201CYou know, after my father lost his brother, he started thinking a lot about the world.\u201D And I thought there\u2019s a redemptive response, that the boy isn\u2019t using a fancy word like redemptive, but he\u2019s getting right down there into the nitty-gritty as religious experience as a consequence or post-mood to human experience equals frailty, suffering, despair, loss, injury, vulnerability, those words. Which of course the Bible\u2019s filled with stories about, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. And I might add also storytelling. We\u2019re the storytelling creature. We are the creature of language and narration. We want to tell about what we remember and tell stories, and that\u2019s what the Bible says, \u201CYes, indeed. That\u2019s how you understand the word. You tell stories to one another.\u201D You know, now that\u2019s interesting, to think about how storytelling is so much at the heart of all of our traditions. Like, I can\u2019t at the moment \u2014 there may be some, but I can\u2019t think of a religious tradition which doesn\u2019t have storytelling at its heart. And, I mean, is that perhaps a connection that children have? Because they know how to listen to stories. They know how to listen. They know how to be told stories. Yeah. They\u2019re told stories all the time. And we lose that, don\u2019t we? That\u2019s right. They go to bed and they\u2019re told stories. They wake up, they\u2019re told additional stories and the world becomes a series of unfolding stories that come to them. And of course the Bible, reflecting that as an echo of that in the strongest sense of the word echo, as an echoing presence, the Bible says, here are some stories, stories of meaning, stories of loss, stories that are redemptive in nature, because they\u2019ll touch you to the bone and to the quick. Even as we ourselves are a story of struggle and hope, but also we have our downsides. Yes. It\u2019s not all happily ever after. No. We have our downsides struggling with our upside, all of us. So as we grow older, we don\u2019t just stop being tellers and listeners of stories, but in that process we also lose a sense of how stories convey truth. That\u2019s right. Which is what our traditions try to preserve for us. We hope so. And if we lose that then we\u2019re in a different kind of jeopardy. I mean, then that\u2019s what it is to be lost. To be lost in such a way that you don\u2019t have any stories to think about and fall back on and that you wander around in your own self without any larger frame of reference or purpose or meaning. I wrote a book called The Call of Stories, and boy, did I mean that, because stories call us. And of course that\u2019s what religion is. It\u2019s stories, in the best sense of the word story, calling to us. Events, these are larger-than-life figures who took part in larger-than-life human drama. There\u2019s no question. I mean, if start thinking of what went on between Abraham and Isaac, which Kierkegaard talked about a Christian echo of Jewish experience. Kierkegaard knew how important that was, that a father could say to a son, you know, \u201CIf necessary, even the loss of your life.\u201D I mean, it stuns us. I think some early Judaism comes so powerfully to the point of human drama, you know, and possibility. Yes. And I think that \u2014 I know from my own children also that it\u2019s not just that they are curious but that their imaginations are so alive. I mean, drama is something they are given to naturally. And they\u2019re ready for that, aren\u2019t they? Yeah. And they\u2019re ready for it and they\u2019re interested in it. And of course they\u2019re interested in a lot of things that a lot of us are not so willing to talk about. I\u2019ve had children in Sunday school ask me about the Virgin Mary, and they want to know about the mystery of Jesus\u2019 appearance among us and, boy, they want to get down to all kinds of details. And I try to bring us to a more lyrical and symbolic level, which is, I think, what the Bible intends, although who am I to speak about what the Bible intends? But the figures in the Bible, men and women, older people, children, they all tell us about the world we\u2019re a part of, and they tell us about ourselves. And children know this. They just know it in their bones. And they\u2019ll speak it out. Robert Coles\u2019s warm and wise presence was on full display during his 2008 Lowell Lecture at Harvard University. In the filmed talk, he shares what he\u2019s learned from children in crisis across the world, and he recounts the moving details of his first encounter with six-year-old Ruby Bridges during the desegregation of her school in New Orleans in 1960.

After a short break, more conversation with Robert Coles, including his observations of qualities of childhood that mark adult lives of leadership. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CThe Inner Lives of Children.\u201D For the first time, we\u2019re featuring a wide-ranging conversation I had with renowned child psychiatrist Robert Coles in his Boston living room in the year 2000. We\u2019re exploring what he has learned across a lifetime of listening to children and how that formed his approach to the meaning of religion and humanity at every age. Robert Coles won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for his book series Children of Crisis, which emerged from his studies of how children in the 1960s and 1970s developed in times of social upheaval. He is now 79 and retired from Harvard, but still writing and speaking. His classic 1990 work, The Spiritual Life of Children, is still widely read and studied. For that book, Robert Coles spent thousands of hours interviewing children around the world, including children of migrant farm workers, Hopi children, and Swedish children, Pakistani children living in London, and children of affluence in his own Boston backyard. I worked in Israel too when I was doing the spiritual life book and the whole effort involved in it. I talked with children in all parts of the world, but I made a point of going to Israel and talking with the children there, Jewish children, Christian children living in Israel, and Arab children living in Israel, a religion I know very little about. But of course there are certain convergences that bring together Judaism, Christianity, and the Mohammedan world. Tell me about those that you observed in speaking with children. Well, the convergences have to do with God and the mystery. The convergences, by the way, are also calendar-like in nature. The humanity of us all that connects to calendars, to the end of the year, the beginning of the year. To our need for ritual. And for holidays and the importance of a holiday as means of marking time and pondering and reflecting. What the religions say to us is this is what we share as human beings and this, by the way, is what children pick up very quickly. They know. They know. They know the origins of this and our origins, you know. The connection of all of this, by the way, to eating, what foods you eat sitting around a table, of prayer as an aspect of our urgent human need to hope and to settle things with the unpredictability of the fatefulness of life \u2014 which is where mystery comes into this \u2014 the fatefulness of life, which is around any corner, isn\u2019t it \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 for all of us. So the convergence is there. And I\u2019m also intrigued in your work in how the differences come out. For example, you\u2019ve often had children drawing pictures, and it sounds like children have great pride and ownership of the pictures they draw and the things they understand. They sure do. When they look at \u2026 By the way, talk about children and drawing. I\u2019ve asked them if they want to draw a picture of how you would represent God. Well, they turn to me and say, \u201CNo, you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t picture God.\u201D \u201CWell, you can,\u201D I\u2019ll say, repeating what they said to me. \u201CYou can\u2019t do it, because God is not in a picture.\u201D \u201CWell, where is God?\u201D Listen to the theology that\u2019s getting going here between me and them. They\u2019ll say, \u201CWell, he\u2019s beyond. Beyond.\u201D And then I had a kid say to another kid, \u201CWell, where is he beyond? Is he in the sky? Is he up there near the stars?\u201D Of course, these are the questions we all ask. Then I\u2019ve had girls say, \u201CHow about she? God is a she.\u201D \u201CGod is a he.\u201D \u201CWell, God is God,\u201D I\u2019ve had kids say to settle the argument, which is quite beautiful. God is God. And they put in their pictures, boy do they, they put in their pictures the emotions and the stories that they\u2019ve learned as a result of their religious experience in churches in synagogues. Now, in the Jewish religion, they\u2019re told you don\u2019t represent by pictures God, of course. But then I\u2019ve had children say, \u201CYou don\u2019t represent him in pictures, but you can think of him,\u201D they\u2019ll say. \u201CYes.\u201D \u201CYou can talk about him?\u201D \u201CWell, he must look like something,\u201D I heard in a synagogue in a school there, \u201Cbut we can\u2019t tell you what he looks like.\u201D Which is a good way of settling it theologically. You know, in a way when they settle these things theologically, they\u2019re settling it the way that theology had to settle it. I mean, if the rules are and if the experience is this is almost unfathomable and it\u2019s beyond understanding, then you settle it that way finally, even when you\u2019re thinking of drawing pictures. But they draw pictures of people of power and influence, evocative pictures that render the evocative nature of religious experience, the mystery of it all. I wonder if in your career you\u2019ve encountered skeptics who wonder whether the children you speak with haven\u2019t somehow been trained to talk about God through their environment or through their families. But I think that in what I\u2019ve read you also find that children who are living in very secular environments are making these same kinds of observations and asking questions which are essentially spiritual questions. Is that right? Yes. I think it\u2019s an aspect of their human nature. They may be brought up in a secular world but they have deep inner sides to them that are non-secular in nature, which have to do with eternal questions of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. You might call them verity or evil or whatever, but children do come up with that amazingly at times in which they ask even about their own parents: \u201CI wonder why my parents struggled so hard to get into this neighborhood.\u201D And then they say to one another they forgot what really matters. Now, when you hear a child saying that they heard their parents say that, they\u2019re remembering something. They\u2019re remembering moral conflict and struggle, or they\u2019re witnessing it and they\u2019re holding on to it. And in that sense, children of course are witnesses. And this witness that children have naturally within a family, within the developing institutional world that they meet when they\u2019re taken to the stores, to the marketplaces, and of course start attending school, they\u2019re witnesses. They\u2019re outsiders who are learning certain ways of being. But they also have a critical side to them as all outsiders do, and they\u2019re asking why and they\u2019re wondering about things. And that is a very important part of childhood and may be an important part of all of our lives as we try to reason with ourselves about what is called necessary and important and what may not be so desirable or may even be wicked, if I may use a biblical kind of word, wicked. You\u2019ve also done a great deal of research and writing, not just on the spiritual life of children but the moral life of children and the political life of children. How would you describe after all of the thinking and work you\u2019ve done the relationship between the political and moral and spiritual lives of children? Those are words I use which describe an aspect of human experience, but they merge. Politics has to do ultimately not only with place and power and governmental identification and the flag and loyalty to a certain country\u2019s history, but politics also has to do with morality, because it has certain principles, the rules of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, or whatever, the laws of the land, so to speak. So the political life begins to connect in its own way with the religious and moral life of those people who are living in a certain nation. And what I did is I asked children about what is America. What do you think America stands for? Because I want to find out what it means to children to feel American and to speak as they feel an American should speak. But I also, in listening to this pretty soon here, coming up with being an American, as they talk, means being a good person versus a bad person and maybe even means living this way rather than that way, which in turn connects with their religious and spiritual beliefs, certainly with their moral beliefs. And on and on it goes. Child psychiatrist and author Robert Coles. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Inner Lives of Children: A Conversation with Robert Coles.\u201D In addition to his work with and about children, he has also befriended and written about exceptional adults in his long career, among them the poet and physician William Carlos Williams, musician Bruce Springsteen, and Catholic social activist Dorothy Day. I\u2019m really struck in the sort of breadth of your writing that you have not only been observing and influenced by wise children, but also there\u2019s some wise adult figures, who recur in your writings. Dorothy Day is the one that comes to mind, but there are others. In particular, when I read what you have written about her, you talk about a quality that she had of noticing and wondering and taking things and people sort of at face value. And so I wonder if you make a correlation between adults whom you admire and let\u2019s say lives of moral leadership and some of these qualities of the children you\u2019ve studied. Oh, very much so. If I may be a little sweeping in a generalization, with all due respect to Dorothy Day and some of the others I\u2019ve met, there\u2019s nothing that they possess, and I\u2019m sure they would admit it, that isn\u2019t part of their childhood and of the childhood of all of us. Namely, searching, wondering, asking, questioning, and maybe sometimes falling flat on one\u2019s face. Because Dorothy Day used to talk that way remembering her own childhood and talking about other people. Now, I would mention here, if I may, that some of the most remarkable people I\u2019ve met, referring to your observation of adults, of parents and whatever, I met in the course of working with children. I met people that were connected to those children. There\u2019s a book I wrote, it\u2019s called The Old Ones of New Mexico, if you\u2019ll pardon me mentioning a book I wrote, but it\u2019s about elderly people in northern New Mexico. And I met them because I was talking with children of Spanish-speaking background. But I found that some of their grandparents, especially these elderly people, were remarkable people. Wise and thoughtful. They didn\u2019t go to high school even, let alone college, but boy, they were smart and very thoughtful, and I wanted to celebrate that. I wanted to listen to them and I offered their words to the public as a writer who listens and uses the tape recorder as you\u2019re using now. But I wanted to acknowledge myself to them and acknowledge to other people that children have companions in grandparents and in parents and in teachers, in adults. But I wonder, do you see \u2014 is there some capacity of people who you\u2019ve observed to be wise at an older age \u2026 Yes. \u2026 have they been able to somehow retain or live into some of these qualities of childhood? Yes, I think you\u2019re right. I think that that\u2019s the challenge to all of us, not to forget our childhood and to forget its possibilities. You can be law abiding, but also, one hopes and prays, spontaneous and your own person and willing to even break some rules that you think ought to be broken. Not in order to be a pain in the neck or a lawless person, but in order to capture your own individual particularity and spontaneity. That\u2019s where children have: a spontaneous ongoing direction that is theirs. Let\u2019s restrain ourselves as we endeavor to work with our children to help them to be a bit more civil sometimes, but let\u2019s not banish from them the positive side of childhood, its yearning interest in the world, almost unquenchable appetite for finding out about things and experiencing them. Not in order to be lawless or difficult or self-indulgent, but in order to explore this universe which is our task. Isn\u2019t that what religions tell us? To explore the world and to realize and fulfill our individual humanity as citizens of this planet lucky enough to be here, given that chance for a few years of human experience, which is what a life is. Yeah. Those spiritual questions that you describe that children ask are really the questions of what does it mean to be human, aren\u2019t they? To be fully human. All the time they ask these questions. Unfortunately, some of us think we ought to stop them from asking them, probably, because we\u2019re made uncomfortable by the questions. Right. But I hope we are made uncomfortable when they stop asking the questions, because those questions really mean something. Why is this world this way? Why do people say these things to other people? Why can\u2019t people \u2014 as one girl said to me in a class, the fourth grade, she said, \u201CWhy can\u2019t people get along better with one another?\u201D And I heard that question, I thought, oh, boy, she should be president of the United States. Well, if you think about it, if she follows that question \u2026 Yeah. If she starts there and spends her life pursuing that question and working out answers to that question that could be profound, couldn\u2019t it? Well, let\u2019s hope she continues to ask it. Yeah. And let\u2019s hope we continue to listen to it and try to answer it for ourselves. I mean, it\u2019s a gift to ask a question like that. It\u2019s a gift to hear the question posed, and then it\u2019s a challenge to try to find the answer for her and for us. Child psychiatrist and author Robert Coles. I sat in his living room in the summer of 2000 when terrorism, U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and economic crisis were, for Americans, part of an unimaginable future. Yet even then Robert Coles sounded a note of cautious realism that is all the more instructive now. Let\u2019s face it. This is a pretty lucky time in American history. We\u2019ve got a solid economy. We\u2019re not in the midst of a war nor have we been recently. And this has been a time \u2014 talk about privileged ones \u2014 this is a time of privilege for the nation in which we\u2019re not losing people in wars and we\u2019re not, by and large, having our country suffer a severe economic crisis and depravation that goes with such an economic crisis. So against that background things aren\u2019t quite as bad, certainly, as they were in the 1930s, for instance, when Hitler threatened the whole Western world, the whole world itself, and beyond Hitler there was the Great Depression that afflicted a number of the Western democratic nations. On the other hand, I think, look, every generation of Americans and of people on the planet has to struggle with the possibility of sudden danger, sudden evil, sudden monstrousness of one kind or another. So there is possibility of danger that we have to think about and, by the way, bring up our children to know how to deal with and to accept as in some way around a corner possibly for them and for us. That\u2019s why children who, after all, know about the world, they listen to the radio, they watch television, they hear their parents talk \u2026 But you\u2019re saying again these are these realities which we always have lived with. I am afraid so. Yeah. I don\u2019t want to be gloomy and too pessimistic, but I think, you know, this is what Freud knew. This is why Freud stirred up a lot of criticism, because he acknowledged that there \u2014 well, he acknowledged, really, what the Bible acknowledges: that there is an evil side to people, and maybe it\u2019s inescapable. But he also said, let\u2019s try to understand it, and maybe through our rational and decent sides we can overcome that or at least hold it in abeyance or keep it under some kind of control, which is every human being\u2019s task, I would say, if I may be a bit of a moralist. Which I hope we all are with ourselves and with respect to one another, that we have to keep waging the struggle, whether you want to call it against original sin, against the unconscious and its willful evil side. No matter what language you use, whether it be secular or religious, this is a human struggle, to be somewhat honorable and decent knowing that it is a struggle to keep that going. Because there are moody, unsettling times when we become all too self-serving if not greedy, if not refusing in our prejudicial manner. And let us hope and pray we win that struggle overall in our lives, which is what the religions tell us. Keep struggling, because you\u2019ll be judged at the end. Right. And they\u2019re right. We are judged at the end, whether you want to take it literally and take it judged by the Almighty in a certain mysterious location and manner that is beyond our factual imagination. But nevertheless, we are judged by ourselves and by those we leave when we are dying. Because, you know, they say, well, this is the kind of life he or she lived, and I\u2019m thinking about it now in retrospect and in summation. All right. Here\u2019s my last question. OK. This is my last question. I\u2019m wondering what pieces of these spiritual insights and wisdom of children have most affected and informed your own evolving understanding of how life is to be lived? Well, I think I\u2019d respond to that question by saying those questions that they ask I think have helped me to ask my own questions about how I ought to live and what I ought to do and what matters. And that\u2019s the gift the children offer us in homes, but also I would say in the work I do. I leave some of the classrooms or homes that I\u2019ve visited in the course of this research and I\u2019m kind of shaking my head a little bit. I sometimes have even stopped the car as I drive away, stop a mile later down the road, and I just think about what I\u2019ve heard from those children and try to say to myself, remember that. Remember those questions. Remember their interest. Remember their unflagging determination to find answers and to figure things out. You should be trying to figure things out. Try to connect yourself to some of that freewheeling adventuresome side of their minds and hearts. And that\u2019s a good part of childhood, as we all know. It\u2019s a wonderful part of childhood, and let\u2019s hope it lives on even as we also hope that the children learn to be good decent members of a country and of a community. So it\u2019s a balance. OK. But that balance children remind us of, even as we try to be balanced parents, going back and forth and encouraging different aspects of human life in our children as we try to find that balance in ourselves. Robert Coles is a retired child psychiatrist and Harvard professor and the author of over 70 books, including The Spiritual Life of Children. His latest books include House Calls with William Carlos Williams, M.D. and Minding the Store, an anthology of literary reflections on the business world. In a recent production visit to Trinity Church on Wall Street, our producers discovered an archive of more than 13,000 letters and drawings by children that were posted on the walls and pews of Trinity\u2019s chapel at what became Ground Zero after the twin towers fell. These messages of support to rescue workers and families illustrate Robert Cole\u2019s stories about the witness and wisdom of children. We\u2019ve scanned high-resolution images of some of them for you to view. See them online at speakingoffaith.org.
