  "fullText": "Tiffany Shlain thinks of the internet when she thinks of her favorite quote of the naturalist John Muir, that \u201Cwhen you tug at a single thing in the universe, you find it\u2019s attached to everything else.\u201D She is an internet pioneer and a filmmaker committed to reframing technology as an expression of the best of what humanity is capable, with all the complexity that entails. She founded the Webby Awards \u2014 the \u201COscars of the Internet\u201D \u2014 which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. And for over six years she and her young family have held to a technology sabbath or \u201Cshabbat\u201D \u2014 24 unplugged hours each week. Her perspective on our technology-enhanced lives is ultimately a purposeful and enriching one \u2014 the internet is our global brain, towards which we can apply all the wisdom we are gaining about the brains in our heads and the character in our lives. There\u2019s a point in the development of a child\u2019s brain where all the different parts of the brain are connected that they can have their first insight. And extrapolating that out to the internet, the moment that we can truly get everyone on the internet connected, imagine the insight that will be able to happen when we have that many different perspectives coming together in one network. And I think the challenge is going to be to create enough collaborative tools to make that happen. But that makes me incredibly hopeful. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Tiffany Shlain grew up in California. Her many films include the feature-length Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death, and Technology. This touched on the life and ideas of her late father, the renowned surgeon, inventor, and author Leonard Shlain. I wonder how you would start to talk about what you would call the spiritual background of your childhood, however you would define that language now, looking back. Hm. It\u2019s definitely changed how I would describe it, but I think \u2014 I grew up as a cultural California Jew with two parents from the Midwest \u2014 they\u2019re both from Detroit. And we were culturally Jewish, but I wouldn\u2019t say religious, and I understand \u2014 my grandfather escaped when he was 16 from Odessa, Ukraine, and was put in the back of a hay truck. And he never wanted to talk about it. And as a young adult, I learned that his whole family died in the Holocaust. Wow. And I think that that probably colored my father\u2019s experience in his home. I\u2019d say both my parents were on the agnostic side of things. But it was a very intellectually curious home, a lot of questioning. I would say we probably felt the most spiritual when we\u2019d go river rafting, which we did quite often. I think it was in your Connection film that you talked about \u2014 you grew up with your father, who was your version of Einstein. You called him \u201CDad.\u201D Mm-hmm. But I\u2019m really intrigued by how it seems your father was always making these fascinating connections between breakthroughs in art and breakthroughs in science, and that space. And that\u2019s also something \u2014 you\u2019ve kind of moved into that lineage, as well. Yeah. I think a lot of my \u2014 the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree. He wrote this this book, Art and Physics, which looked at the parallel visions in these two worlds, and how artists and scientists are often talking about the same ideas, but one\u2019s with images, and one\u2019s with equations. And then ended up \u2014 actually, the way I met my husband, who is an artist and a scientist, is he went to hear my dad speak, and we fell in love that night. And a lot of our \u2014 we collaborate on a lot of stuff, projects, together, and exploring art and science is a strong connection. And then my mother, when I was growing up, was getting her Ph.D. in psychology, and her explorations of the inner world and emotions and how much that drives what we do, that\u2019s been a big part, too, with the character work. Yeah. Did you know that Einstein said that a sense of wonder and a reverence for mystery, that this is something that is at the core of the best of science and religion and the arts? Ah, I love that. Actually, Einstein, who my father wrote about a lot, he was a part of a lot of my bedtime stories from my dad. But I wrestle a lot with questions around religion and the word \u201CGod,\u201D and I really have wrestled with that, because it does shut me down. Even though I \u2014 if I don\u2019t use that word, I\u2019m more comfortable. But I remember hearing \u2014 I read this great chapter \u2014 I think it was Walter Isaacson wrote it in like a profile book of all the rabbis and theologians questioning Einstein, whether he believed in God, and he finally said, I have a humility for the complexity that I don\u2019t understand, and an awe. I\u2019m not saying it exactly how he said it, but that spoke \u2014 that has always spoken to me the most. I mean, that \u2014 when I read that, I just felt this amazing sense of connection, and relief, and an articulation of my own sense of my place in the world, and a reverence for this larger complexity. Something I so admire and really want to kind of delve into, which I see as the big \u2014 part of a big vision behind everything that you do, which is, you are really making a connection between the fact that our brains are designed for connection, and the internet is an extension of our brains, that it was made to connect data, but now it connects us. And seeing this digital world that we often define as something separate from us, and even something that\u2019s tyrannical, that\u2019s taking over our lives. I love the analogy that you draw with the brain, with our brains, and with human connection. And I think it seems kind of obvious to you \u2014 and it\u2019s one of those things that seems obvious when you say it, but it\u2019s really not the narrative that we have\u2026 I know. \u2026running through our culture. It\u2019s amazing. We seem to talk about technology as if it\u2019s other than us when we\u2019ve created it. It\u2019s a reframing. It is an extension of our abilities. It\u2019s an amplification of our desire to connect, of our desire to do more \u2014 so, it is us. And we are good, bad, and everything in between. So you can talk about technology as a force for bad, but you can also talk about it as a force for good. Or you could just talk about it as an extension of us. And if we\u2019re mindful about the way we use technology, we can shape it. And it\u2019s not something that\u2019s overtaking us. I think a lot of people talk about, \u201COh, I\u2019m so overwhelmed with technology.\u201D Well, you can turn it off, also, and that\u2019s been a really profound thing for me. I was very immersed in technology. My husband\u2019s a professor of robotics, and my father wrote a lot about the brain, and he was a surgeon and operated on it. And he did get brain cancer, which was very difficult. And I\u2019m sure anyone who has had someone really close to them dying \u2014 when I would go over to see him for \u2014 sometimes it was just one good hour a day, we would turn off our phones and just be incredibly present with my dad. And when he died, I just \u2014 I said, \u201CKen, I \u2014 can we as a family\u201D \u2014 and we have children \u2014 \u201Ccan we turn off the screens for Shabbat?\u201D And we call them our \u201Ctechnology shabbats.\u201D And I cannot tell you \u2014 we\u2019re now just starting our seventh year of doing it. And it has been the most profound thing. It\u2019s incredible \u2014 going back to what you originally asked, it\u2019s incredibly empowering to also know that I needed to turn it off and that I could, and we made this family commitment to do it. Right. And I find that having just that day without any screens, without any technology, is such a beautiful rebalancing. And I think more deeply. I\u2019m more reflective. I think about the bigger picture. And then \u2014 and also it\u2019s a wonderful day with my family. And then on Saturday night, this kind of dual effect, which I didn\u2019t expect at all, is that I kind of reappreciate technology all over again, because I\u2019m very excited to, like \u2014 oh, I have a thought that I want to look up, and I look it up! Yeah. So, you echo something that\u2019s come up in many of my conversations across the years, including with Sherry Turkle, who I think is a friend of yours\u2026 Yeah, she\u2019s a friend. \u2026that the internet is in its infancy, and it\u2019s up to us to grow it up. That we\u2019re the adults in the room, whether we feel like that or not. Yeah. We need to have agency, and that\u2019s a framing of what it is to us. It\u2019s an extension of us. It\u2019s not this other thing that somebody\u2019s doing to us. And then you\u2019re \u2014 it seems to me that \u2014 you\u2019re also saying that the internet and this technology makes connection possible. It\u2019s an engine of connection, and that\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026growing it up, and shaping it to human purposes for the world we want to live in and we want to raise our children in means delving into it in that spirit, and also, at the same time, knowing when to unplug. Right? Yeah, and being mindful \u2014 actually, the word \u201Cmindful\u201D \u2014 I have to tell you the new word that I love to ground the word \u201Cmindful,\u201D which is so used everywhere now. OK, here it is \u2026 It is. It\u2019s one of those overused words. I know. It\u2019s so overused it\u2019s lost its meaning. So here\u2019s the word that grounds it is \u201Cmetacognition,\u201D which is \u201Cmeta\u201D \u2014 thinking about thinking. It\u2019s the same thing, but it\u2019s so much more \u2014 it grounds it in science, which is exciting to me, and it has kind of teeth to it. It kind of secures itself to the ground. It is a word you have to think about. Yeah. \u201CMetacognition.\u201D You point out \u2014 is this true? \u2014 that there are more connections still \u2014 neural connections in any single human brain than the entire internet possesses now? A child\u2019s brain. Isn\u2019t that incredible? It\u2019s incredible. I was doing this film about \u2014 called \u201CBrain Power,\u201D, which looked at the best way to nurture a child\u2019s brain. And birth to five is the biggest growth period of a child\u2019s brain. And we were trying to show how incredibly important it is to support a brain in those years. Yeah, it\u2019s an awesome fact. And, again, that\u2019s another word. \u201CAwesome.\u201D If you think about the word \u201Cawesome,\u201D \u201Cfull of awe,\u201D that\u2019s a very big word. Oh, you\u2019re so right. But it has become \u2014 it\u2019s become \u2014 but that is truly an awesome \u2014 can we use that word in the right way? It\u2019s an awesome fact. [laughs] No, I like it. Well, and here\u2019s another one. A little bit less overused, but you even single out this word \u201Cubuntu\u201D which is a South African word, and this beautiful philosophical principle and way of being that was there as apartheid ended. And it means \u201CI am, because you are.\u201D And I\u2019ve seen that watered down spiritually, I think, but you say that that principle, in fact, is a perfect way to think about how the human brain develops. Yeah. I think, being a parent, there\u2019s nothing more incredible than experiencing that first-hand with watching your children respond and grow to you, and guiding, and modeling, and all of these things, too. I think a lot about the modeling, even with my work around character and gratitude and all of these things that you hope to instill, and, yeah, it\u2019s interesting. We recently made this film that explored Mussar and being a Mensch. And Mussar is the Jewish lens of the science of character education, which was very exciting for me to learn as a Jew. I had never known about it before. And so there\u2019s this Jewish practice of a hundred blessings a day. You bless everything. But people that truly do this, they\u2019re blessing when they go to the bathroom. They\u2019re blessing a sunrise, a rainbow. And I just love the specificity of blessing every moment. And our children just \u2014 I think them seeing us really try to \u2014 and we don\u2019t actually just say we\u2019re blessing this moment, we\u2019re acknowledging an incredible moment. And it\u2019s wonderful to see them really start to do that now. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with the internet pioneer and filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. She sees a parallel between her purposeful perspective on the internet and the development of the relatively new field, pioneered by Martin Seligman and Christopher Peterson, of positive psychology \u2014 focused less on pathology and more on the development of human wholeness and character. Her production company, The Moxie Institute Film Studio and Lab, has created an annual Character Day with events around the world. Her film \u201CThe Science of Character\u201D develops a periodic table of 24 character strengths positive psychology has identified, such as curiosity, perseverance, gratitude, and humor. So the intellectual, creative side of you is thinking about growing up the internet to its greatest potential, and\u2026 Yes. \u2026in fact, its character. And its potential for incredible connection. But you\u2019ve been working with that idea as you are becoming a mother, and as you\u2019re thinking about healthy child development techniques, and in fact, it\u2019s a perfect analogy. But, again, it\u2019s not the way we tend to think about our\u2026 Well, actually\u2026 \u2026lives with technology. \u2026I love what you just said about character in terms of the internet evolving, that we proactively can evolve the internet and infuse it with character strengths. That is really a framework to think about a healthy evolution of the internet, instead of throwing your hands up and saying this thing is out of our control, and it\u2019s doing all these things. We \u2014 just as we\u2019re raising a child, we need to shepherd this to its maturity, and infuse it with our own sense of character. Right. You talk about how a child\u2019s brain and our brains are always pruning as we get older, and that what we pay attention to gets stronger, and what you pay attention to less gets pruned out. Yeah. And I think you\u2019ve also suggested that, like the human brain, those of us who are adults now have lived through this thing, this phenomenon, landing in the middle of our lives, and in the middle of society, and really turning everything inside out in ways that are still playing out. But you\u2019ve said there\u2019s this possibility that once it has just proliferated, that it might begin to prune. But again, as you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s up to us what direction that takes. Absolutely. I think that\u2019s incredibly empowering, too, if you think of it that way. And it\u2019s exciting, if you think, wow, we\u2019re at this point in human evolution and our civilization where you have this tool that\u2019s creating a nervous system for the whole world, and we can shape it. And we can prune it. And we can strengthen things that are important, and weaken things that are not as important \u2014 or not good for society. There\u2019s so much \u2014 going back to the character, there\u2019s so much science, neuroscience and social science, that\u2019s backing up what we believed to be true. And what was so exciting to me about learning about Seligman and Peterson\u2019s work, that they looked at character, virtues, and strengths all throughout cultures in history. Yeah, their whole idea\u2026 They broke it down. \u2026of positive psychology, yeah. Positive psychology, yes. And they broke it down and they made it accessible and tangible. And I think that, with the internet and with technology, if people find ways to break it down and make it accessible \u2014 even for me, whether it was the technology shabbat and having some way to engage with it that felt more comfortable to me. I think that\u2019s really important. I think what\u2019s also accessible and empowering about that is your emphasis that it doesn\u2019t say that you have to possess all of those wonderful qualities, but that we do have some strengths, and that focusing on the strengths you have and practicing the strengths you have is also your contribution. Yeah, and focusing on the strengths of others. The people around you have strengths, to recognize them, it actually makes them stronger for them, too. And then also when I learned about the kind of Jewish version of these ideas, which is called Mussar \u2014 the way that they talk about it is that we all have just different levels of these strengths. And you can work on them, to build one up, or take it down. And actually, being in different situations, you need to learn how to dial something up and dial something down. Everyone has strengths that you would never say are good, like something like envy. If envy motivates you to actually, maybe, get a new job, or do something, that could possibly have \u2014 it could be useful in some situations. And things like humility, that you can dial up or down humility in different situations, and it\u2019s all about understanding how much space you should take up. Which, I think it was a little bit of a shift for me in the thinking after I learned the positive psychology movement, which I found really interesting. And what was the shift for you? Well, even something like humility, which I think is a beautiful attribute, and then I thought about being a woman, and a woman director, and\u2026 Yeah, it can be \u2026 \u2026there are times where \u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s tricky. Humility can be tricky. Well, on the one hand, OK, my \u2014 if your instinct is to be humble, but then there\u2019s another part of me that\u2019s a complete feminist, and I know that we need to keep pushing it forward. And a lot of times if women don\u2019t say what they\u2019ve done, it won\u2019t get said, and it\u2019s not in the history books. So there\u2019s another part of me that\u2019s like, well, I need to make sure that what a woman has done is known. So it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m inner wrestling with me. But it\u2019s a little \u2014 you know what I mean? Yeah, but then I think \u2014 I also think that\u2019s then \u2014 then it comes down to how \u2014 because humility\u2019s another one of those ruined words. I know. Right? It\u2019s flattened out. And I think it \u2014 then it comes down to how do you define humility, because I actually think \u2026 How do you define it? I\u2019ve \u2014 well, it\u2019s interesting that you asked me, because I actually \u2014 I was at divinity school when my daughter was born, my first child, and so I was doing my version of what you\u2019re doing. I was studying theology. And I was thinking about these ideas, and so, I was reading, at that point, about humility in the Bible, and about what \u2014 Jesus always talks about the humility of a child. And I think I had exactly the same reaction you did, as a woman. To me to be humble was to be ineffective and ineffectual. Right. But I started to look at that word all the way through the text, and the Hebrew Bible, as well, and I realized that I think spiritual humility is actually not about making yourself small or about debasing yourself. It\u2019s about having a proper awe before everything else and everyone else. Right? So you can break that apart, but, so then, I think \u2026 No, I like that. It\u2019s almost like your place in the larger context. That you always are coming from understanding where you are in the larger, interdependent context of the world. Right. Yeah, to put it into that wonderful framework that you use, yeah. Huh, I love that. OK. Thank you for that. You\u2019re welcome. There is a zeitgeist with character, which is exciting for us \u2026 There is. Yeah. It\u2019s developed in the same period of your interest in this. OK, but, actually, wait. I want to ask you, if I can \u2014 we really \u2014 we do this event called Character Day because we felt like when we tried to look up information about it, there were all these silos of information about character. There was education, there were people from the religious, there were people from this\u00A0\u2014 it wasn\u2019t all in one spot. And we thought it\u2019d be very powerful to have a global conversation that was aggregated \u2026 Also, I think, a lot of it has this eat-your-spinach feeling to it. Yes. And we try to make it more exciting. But my question for you is why do you think there is this resurgence of the discussion of character right now in the 21st century in the last couple years? What do you think that\u2019s about? OK. I\u2019ll give you my answer, and then you have to give me yours. How\u2019s that? OK. Well, to me \u2014 so, a word I use probably more than \u201Ccharacter,\u201D but I actually think it\u2019s completely connected, is the language of \u201Cvirtues,\u201D right? Or the\u2026 Right. Yes. \u2026language of wisdom, which is different. And wisdom is one of those strengths, but I think\u2026 Yeah, interesting. \u2026character and virtues, which, to me, are maybe the practices that add up to character. And I find \u2014 I was going to ask you, so \u2014 I find also that the language of virtue, for example, is that people who are a bit older, sometimes, it has baggage to it. But I find that younger people are \u2014 find this language really magnetic. And for me, it\u2019s \u2014 again, the language I use more is \u201Cvirtue,\u201D but I wonder if you find the language of character, that periodic table of strengths, like wisdom, and humility. I don\u2019t know. What else is on there? What else is on there? The \u2026 Yeah\u2026 Probably kindness. Humor. Humor, yeah. Social intelligence. Yeah, I love that humor\u2019s on there, yeah. Oh, yeah, humor\u2019s a big one. I love humor on all of this stuff, because a lot of it is very \u2014 it\u2019s been done in a dry context. And I think humor, really with any intellectual idea, just makes it move more easily in your mind. And I always try to bring that lens, the humor and irony of certain things. I just heard Gloria Steinem speak. And I find her incredibly wise. And she laughs with almost all of her wisdom, and I was noting, God, every \u2014 even when she\u2019s delivering the intense stuff, she\u2019s laughing. And I absolutely love that delivery, because you\u2019re open \u2014 usually, in my films, I will try to make people laugh right before I want them to think deeply. Because when people think they know how they feel about something, their body language, everything is tight. And you make them laugh, and immediately their body opens, and I always feel like I can go in deeper with the idea, or into their heart, or their mind, or both at the same time, hopefully. So I\u2019m pretty deliberate. I\u2019m like, OK, I have this big idea coming, I must make them laugh with either a line or a visual like eight seconds before. It\u2019s not that scientific, but I do think that way, how much laughter is important. You can listen again and share this conversation with Tiffany Shlain through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with internet pioneer and filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. She founded the Webby Awards \u2014 the \u201COscars of the Internet\u201D \u2014 and she and her family have helped popularize the practice of a technology sabbath or shabbat \u2014 24 unplugged hours each week. Tiffany Shlain believes that we can focus far more on the life-giving, character-building potential of the internet, and this is the theme of her films and global projects. The annual Character Day created by her non-profit, Let it Ripple, has encompassed over 6,000 events in over 40 countries. So, if we think about this work of \u2014 really, what we\u2019re talking about here, if we combine these different sides of the conversation, and these different sides of your endeavor \u2014 you\u2019re talking about growing up the internet by growing up ourselves. Right. Like growing up our species. Evolving. Oh, I love that. Yes. Yes. And I feel like you have a lot of \u2014 you\u2019re close to a lot of what we\u2019re learning on this frontier about how we interact with technology and what it does to us. You\u2019ve talked about how, when you\u2019ve gone out with your films, you realized how concerned people are about this, and about what technology\u2019s doing to our brains. So talk a little bit about what you know \u2014 and one thing I want to ask you to explain more about is this MEG imaging, M-E-G\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026and what we\u2019re learning through that. Yeah. People are very concerned. It kind of feels like there\u2019s a hysteria right now about artificial intelligence, which also is an offshoot of that. On some level, I\u2019ve been really interested in neuroscience as it relates to creativity, and there are studies that you need to let your mind wander more. Daydreaming, spacing out, going for a walk, doing the dishes, taking a shower, your mind goes into this whole other mode that is really important for creativity. And what they\u2019ve found is that your mind goes into the default mode network, which is \u2014 it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re taking a journey in your own mind and you\u2019re exploring what\u2019s already in there, and you\u2019re making connections you wouldn\u2019t normally make. Because when you\u2019re doing focused thinking, you\u2019re deliberately thinking. But when you\u2019re daydreaming, you are making unusual connections. And unusual connections are really where I think creativity comes from. So that does concern me. And I feel like people really aren\u2019t making any space for daydreaming. And do you feel like carving out your Shabbat, just even sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, does that then permeate the rest of the week? Oh, yeah. Where you are presumably texting and emailing as much as the rest of us? Yeah. And I\u2019m doing what everyone else is doing the other times. I\u2019m not like some puritan or something. I feel so creative on Sunday morning. It\u2019s crazy. I mean, I \u2014 oh, wait. This is the other thing that happens that really I find fascinating \u2014 when you\u2019re turning off the technology, you are slowing down time. You\u2019re slowing down your mind. And most people that I run into \u2014 I was just at Sundance, and said, \u201CHow are you doing?\u201D \u201COh, I\u2019m so busy.\u201D That\u2019s everybody\u2019s response. I don\u2019t want that to be your response. Tell me something interesting. But everyone feels overwhelmed. So, this amazing thing happens on Friday nights and Saturday morning. My husband and I \u2014 Ken and I still joke. We\u2019ll just be like, \u201CWhat time is it now? Oh, my gosh, it\u2019s only eight in the morning. We\u2019ve done four things!\u201D Time just goes ridiculously slow when your phone is off. Yeah. So, to the addictive feeling of our relationship with our technology, would you say a little bit about what we\u2019re learning about \u2014 the neurotransmitters, like the oxytocin and the dopamine and how those things \u2014 and also not necessarily in ways that seem terrible, but what\u2019s released in our brains\u2026 Oh, yeah. \u2026as we interact with these devices. It\u2019s very similar to \u2014 I\u2019m not proud of this, but in rebellion in my 20s, I smoked. And I know what that feels like. And sometimes I\u2019d have a cigarette in my mouth and want another cigarette. And I would be blown away that that thought could happen. And when you\u2019re on an email and you want to check for a new email, I think that\u2019s the same thing. But yeah, dopamine \u2014 but the good news is that the \u2014 and dopamine, it\u2019s also things that make you feel good, things that make you want more, like food, or sex, or there\u2019s all of these things that you can\u2019t be satiated with. And then on the flipside, with oxytocin \u2014 this is what I love \u2014 oxytocin is the love hormone. When women are breastfeeding, they get flooded with oxytocin. Or it makes you feel trusting. And it makes you want to collaborate. And they\u2019ve shown that when you get a text or an email from someone you love, or someone you feel connected to, you get a rush of oxytocin. So, there\u2019s a part of me that thinks that the reason why there\u2019s all these collaborative businesses on the rise, whether it\u2019s AirBnB, or Lyft, or all these companies that are growing on the internet that are all based on collaboration, is because we are awash of oxytocin. We are so filled with it that we\u2019re just wanting to collaborate. Yeah. Now you used that \u2014 this language of the \u201Cparticipatory revolution fueled by all that oxytocin pinging around.\u201D Yeah. That\u2019s on my most optimistic days. That is what \u2014 that\u2019s a beautiful thing. And, of course, not in a Pollyanna way. I know there\u2019s a lot of very bad things happening in the world, and I do think about those. I\u2019ve chosen in my life \u2014 I feel like we\u2019re surrounded with such bad frameworks on everything with the news, generally. I just feel like I can contribute best if I come from a \u2014 actually, my husband and I call it \u201Copticism.\u201D It\u2019s optimism and skepticism combined and merged. Opticism, because we\u2019re optimistic, but realistic, because we\u2019re \u2014 we love history and grounding it in the past. But I really choose to focus on what we can do instead of feeling overwhelmed and drowning in all the problems in the world. Well, the other thing I think a lot about is \u2014 the internet is a new and very powerful oversized screen for the old human condition. Right? There\u2019s nothing that happens online that doesn\u2019t have an offline corollary. No, it\u2019s amplifying everything that we are. And that\u2019s the amazing thing about it. You use the word \u201Cbeauty\u201D a lot when you talk about technology. And I just \u2014 I wonder what \u2014 how do you \u2014 a phrase like that, that language of the \u201Cbeauty of technology.\u201D What are the connotations that\u2019s filled with for you? I think that probably \u2014 just as you were saying it, I hadn\u2019t really thought about that, but just growing up with my father writing Art and Physics, that the beauty of math \u2014 the poetry of an amazing equation and code and \u2014 I mean, I think art is \u2014 I think beauty really can be applied to everything. I see art and science the way he taught me to see it, which is that they\u2019re just \u2014 one\u2019s images and one\u2019s equations and numbers, but they\u2019re the same \u2014 they\u2019re showing us the same ideas, but in different languages. And he goes all throughout history and kind of charts examples of that in that book. Your father does? Yeah. So, in terms of this work of the internet being in its infancy, and how its foundation is us, in fact, and how we are building its foundation. Where do you see this happening? I mean, you\u2019re out there talking about this stuff. Where do you see this hopeful, character-driven foundation being built? Well, going back to one point you said that I think about a lot is just things that become self-fulfilling prophecies if we keep saying it. I think that with the internet, I absolutely think about it with the women\u2019s story, that we\u2019re always \u201Cnot\u201D \u2014 we\u2019re not enough of this, we\u2019re not enough \u2014 we\u2019re not enough board seats, we\u2019re not enough directing jobs. I never think \u2014 it\u2019s such a different way to think about the world as coming from what we\u2019re not, instead of, for me, which is, where are we? Where are we on are the arc of history? And how can we shape it moving forward? And I think \u2014 I\u2019m very excited about the moment of everyone being online, which I think is going to happen in the next five years. Everyone who wants to be, which will be a very large proportion of the population \u2014 again, going back to the neuroscience of a child\u2019s brain, that there\u2019s a point in the development of a child\u2019s brain where all the different parts of the brain are connected that they can have their first insight. And extrapolating that out to the internet \u2014 we\u2019re, I think, at this point, 60 percent connected. And the moment that we can truly get everyone on the internet connected, imagine what that will be \u2014 the insight that will be able to happen when we have that many different perspectives coming together in one network. And I think the challenge is going to be to create enough collaborative tools to make that happen. But that makes me incredibly hopeful. What would you say \u2026 And I mean, I ultimately \u2026 Keep going, yeah. Oh, I was just going to say that I believe in humanity. I feel like there\u2019ve been a couple moments where we could have knocked the whole \u2014 huge swathes of population away. And we didn\u2019t. And I think, on a really bigger picture, I ultimately believe in humans. And I believe that we\u2019re going to evolve. I think \u2014 like anything, with progress, it\u2019s two steps forward, one step back, and there\u2019s always going to be these parts of us that aren\u2019t great, that are horrible, that are violent, that are always going to be there. But I think on a whole, when we get everyone online, I think you\u2019re going to see amazing things happen that we can\u2019t even imagine. Would you say that \u2014 you cofounded the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and the Webby Awards. Would you say that that\u2019s a way \u2014 that\u2019s a tool or platform for\u2026 Absolutely. \u2026calling out character and goodness and excellence? Yeah. What was so exciting when I founded the Webbys back \u2014 a long time ago, it was really about this very young medium, that we wanted to set the standard of excellence, and say this is the best. Just like what you\u2019re saying, if we put it to character, these have the best attributes and strengths on the web right now. Here\u2019s excellence, and now push beyond it next year. And next year it always \u2014 you\u2019re constantly raising the bar of what is excellence and what are strengths. And you help evolve something, just like with your \u2014 like you were saying earlier, if you\u2019re raising the internet. You\u2019re helping to develop it. It\u2019s funny, now \u2014 because they\u2019re called \u201Cweb developers,\u201D and I just thought of that in a whole different way just now. It\u2019s so true. Web developers. We\u2019re all developing it. Yeah, well, also \u2014 yeah, exactly, and to that point, if you think about \u2014 because you do make this connection now. Think about growing up the internet in terms of what are healthy child development techniques. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s wonderful. And just what you said a minute ago about self-fulfilling prophecies. We know if we\u2019re raising a human being in the world, and we\u2019re constantly generalizing about them and their future on the basis of the worst thing they did, this mistake they made. Exactly. This flaw, this character flaw. Thank you. Yes. That\u2019s the news. That\u2019s how we ruin them. That\u2019s what I find \u2014 if we\u2019re just constantly saying the worst of humanity, which is the news, that is what you\u2019re hearing. And if you\u2019re raising a child, just bringing \u2014 that would be the worst way to raise a child, instead of \u2014 this is what you can become, this is where you need to go, these are examples of excellence, you\u2019re saying the worst. And, yeah, I\u2019m tired of that. What do we want this to be? Let\u2019s think about it together. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with internet pioneer and filmmaker Tiffany Shlain. I notice you\u2019ve also worked out \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this formalized, but something like rules of etiquette for the internet age, I would say, with Sherry Turkle. Can you share a couple of those? Yeah, when people write really long emails. Who\u2019s going to read them right now? The hundred-word-or-less email, bullet point, clear subject header. Also, I laugh when you ask to see a photo of one of your friends\u2019 children, and they pull out their phone. And suddenly they get lost in their last year of photos. \u201COh, let me show \u2014 oh, no, no, no. Let me show you this one. Let me show this one.\u201D And then by the end, you didn\u2019t want to see 20 videos and six photos. You wanted to see how their child had grown, and appreciate their child for a second. What was the one about finishing a text, not \u2014 if your spouse walks into the room, you \u2026 Oh, actually, I try to really not walk into a room talking on the phone. Because that \u2014 you don\u2019t realize how much that, for the person that is in the home, when you\u2019re in mid-conversation, it\u2019s not a great way to greet someone. Right. But it\u2019s a little thing that \u2014 you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t think about the effect we\u2019re having on each other. Or our presence. Our presence. That\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful about the \u2014 even in the technology shabbats, everyone turns off their phone, all the screens, and you\u2019re just \u2014 you\u2019re very present with each other. I remember when my father died, there was a lot of people at his funeral that I hadn\u2019t met before, but they all came up to me and shared some story. And what most of them said to me in different ways was, your father always made me feel like the most important person in the room. And I feel like today no one makes anyone feel like they\u2019re the most important person in the room. Yeah, we have\u2026 It\u2019s \u2026 \u2026our habits kind of work against that, don\u2019t they? Yeah. There are just too many things that are more important that could happen at any moment. And you just \u2014 we have to pay attention to the emotional connectedness. And a lot of people worry about the youth, and they\u2019re like, \u201COh, the kids, they don\u2019t make eye contact,\u201D and all \u2014 I\u2019m, in general, not so worried about the youth. I feel like we\u2019ve gone through so many different technologies that have changed the way we\u2019ve experienced the world. And ultimately, we\u2019re humans, and we need to make eye contact. That \u2014 we\u2026 That they\u2019re not going to stop doing that. \u2026that the mother and child have to make it for a child\u2019s brain to grow. And if you\u2019re in a marriage you have to make eye contact. You have to connect authentically, or else that marriage, it won\u2019t work. And real relationships require deep connection. And again, this goes back to \u2014 I believe in humans, I believe we\u2019re in this very transformational period with all this technology, and that we need to evolve and create \u2014 whether you want to call them habits or practices that allow for the connectivity while also utilizing this amazing tool of the internet. Do you \u2014 I think a lot these days about how, even when \u2014 my children are now 17 and 22. But when my children were young, the great fear was that television would rot their brains. Right. And now they are young adults, and as the world has changed in that time, if we are all in the same room, watching the same TV show, that is quality time. Right? Yeah, I was just thinking about that when I was at Sundance just \u2014 I watched a whole bunch of movies in a big theater with lots of people, which was so delicious and wonderful to just experience all those things with other people. And it\u2019s so much fun to watch that with your family when you really get into a movie or a show together. It\u2019s so wonderful. But television was the big fear. That was the big fear, which is funny to me now as I hardly \u2014 I watched so much television when my parents got divorced. And that became the surrogate family that wasn\u2019t happening during a very difficult time in my family. And watched The Brady Bunch more than I care to share to with you. So, tell me \u2014 I wonder, when you think about technology and human connection, I wonder if there are insights into that, aspects of that, that are surprising you right now, that you couldn\u2019t even have known or imagined five years ago, or ten years ago, and what are \u2014 are there some things you\u2019ve been learning that feel fresh and kind of take you\u2026 OK, I\u2026 \u2026in the next direction? I\u2019ll tell you, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m kind of wrestling with how I think about it, which is that we recently have a device in our house called the Alexa. And it\u2019s an Amazon speaker that you can verbally say, \u201CWhat\u2019s the weather?\u201D or \u201CPut on NPR news,\u201D or \u201CPlay Nina Simone,\u201D or whatever, and it just does it. And I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about, was it the screen that was bothering me? Because suddenly there\u2019s this verbal \u2014 and it\u2019s really intuitive. It really works. You can say anything and it\u2019ll happen. And it\u2019s in the center in the kitchen, and it\u2019s great if you\u2019re cooking, because you can put multiple timers on it, which I love. Anyway, I\u2019ve been thinking about, OK, so I don\u2019t have a screen, but I\u2019m suddenly interacting with this larger infosphere, and is that too much? Is it \u2014 what does that mean? I\u2019m thinking about that a lot. Because I think that\u2019s going to be soon just commonplace, where you\u2019re verbally saying all these things into the ether and responses happen. And how is that going to change things? And that it\u2019s only the voice involved. Yeah, it\u2019s just the voice. And I think a lot about robotics, obviously, because my husband makes them. And there\u2019s so many concerns over them. And he\u2019s not, again, concerned. He thinks it\u2019s going to be a very collaborative relationship on outsourcing things humans don\u2019t need to do, and humans will still do what, of course, they need to do, which is creative thinking, and empathy, and all of these other things. So going back to your question of things that have surprised me, I\u2019m always surprised by how powerful \u2014 and again, I think this has to do with the tech shabbats. Every week I get re-surprised there\u2019s a new look of surprise now \u2014 of just this sense of connection with people, with ideas, and then I ultimately feel incredibly connected to the people that I meet online, on Twitter \u2014 mostly on Twitter, actually. I feel most exposed to new, fresh ideas I wouldn\u2019t have interfaced with. I heard this funny thing that Facebook is who you went to school with and Twitter\u2019s who you wish you went to school with. Which I think embodies the way I think about the technology, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting at the larger question about the bigger surprise, which \u2014 or\u2026 No. No, that\u2019s all good. I made fun of Twitter for such a long time having not tried it. And it\u2019s so counterintuitive in a way that something\u2026 It is, yeah. \u2026that \u2014 right? That forces \u2014 which was what I made fun of \u2014 that forces anything into that many characters, I think has such \u2014 it has \u2014 obviously, it\u2019s not always poetic and profound, but it has this incredible capacity for poetry and\u2026 It really\u2026 \u2026profundity and connection. Yeah. I feel it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m interfacing with just so many ideas. And it\u2019s exciting \u2014 it, actually, it\u2019s going back to almost that default mode network where the unusual connections that I look down and I see some idea, and I was just thinking about something else, and then that just joined with that idea, and some new idea will happen. And I\u2019m always like, oh, that was \u2014 that\u2019s fantastic. So I love that. I love that. The idea generation that comes from that. How do you think \u2014 the passions you\u2019ve lived into, which have so much to do with technology, and our lives with technology, and connection \u2014 how do you think all of that has flown in and shaped your sense of what it means to be human? How would you start to talk about that? It\u2019s a huge question, but how would you \u2014 where would you start to talk about that? I feel, through the technology in some ways, it\u2019s almost in the way that science has given an underpinning to ideas that have been around for a long time. And in a lot of ways, the technology connecting all of us, and the tactility of the technology, is creating this kind of underpinning of our yearning for this larger connecting to something larger than ourselves. Does that make sense? Yeah, it\u2019s great. Have you ever heard of Teilhard de Chardin? Do you know his\u2026 Of course. Of course. I \u2026 In a way, the idea of spiritual evolution, and the idea \u2014 his perception through working with a long view of time, right, but with how far humanity had come physiologically through evolution. And his sense that the noos \u2014 that this realm of idea, human creativity and ideas and thought would kind of overlay the biosphere, and would transform the biosphere, would transform reality. To me, that \u2014 it\u2019s one way to also talk about what you\u2019re proposing. And I think you have a long view of time, as well, that we should be aiming for, in very practical ways in terms of how we live our every day. Yes. It\u2019s all the little moments that are tapping into this bigger interdependent network. How we tap into it are the ways that we can infuse the sense of character in how we\u2019re growing and evolving the internet. And this larger interdependent system that we\u2019re creating, that\u2019s showing us what already is there so deeply.
