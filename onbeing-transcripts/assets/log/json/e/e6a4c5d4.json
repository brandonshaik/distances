  "fullText": "I think what our generation seems to be living through is the realization that rationalism is only part of the answer. I think I\u2019m not the first one to notice this \u2014 that Auschwitz and Hiroshima were perfectly rational decisions and behaviors. So there\u2019s this sense that religion has to be more than rationalism. And mysticism offers this, sort of like in the corner, \u201CPsst, hey, kid. How would you like a direct experience of the divine? Would that help your religious life?\u201D And a lot of people discover that they\u2019re mystics after all when they\u2019re given that offer. \u201CThis,\u201D Rabbi Lawrence Kushner has written, \u201Cis a definition of a mystic: A mystic is anyone who has the gnawing suspicion that the apparent discord, brokenness, contradictions, and discontinuities that assault us every day might conceal a hidden unity.\u201D Kushner is a long-time student and articulator of the mysteries and messages of the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah. He was influenced, like every modern student of Kabbalah, by a Jewish historian named Gershom Scholem, who was born in 1897 and died in 1982, and literally resurrected this tradition from obscurity. I spoke with Rabbi Kushner in 2014 in honor of Gershom Scholem\u2019s legacy, and it\u2019s in the spirit of Kabbalah \u2014 which wraps teachings in teachings, wisdom in wisdom, life within life \u2014 that we get to know Scholem through the living ideas of this rabbi in his lineage. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner is a scholar-in-residence at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco. And he\u2019s written many books that touch on themes of Kabbalah, including a novel, Kabbalah: A Love Story. Gershom Scholem suggested that the Zohar, the Kabbalah\u2019s core text, was itself a mystical novel. He demonstrated that the Zohar was not written, as had previously been assumed, by a second-century Galilean sage, but by the 13th-century Castilian Kabbalist Moshe de Leon. Still, it entered the spiritual bloodstream of Judaism \u2014 with new ways of understanding and describing the inner structure of reality, a feminine side of God, and the cosmic significance of each ritual and ethical deed. According to Kabbalah, all being is rooted in the Ein Sof, the Holy Oneness of Creation. So when did Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism enter your imagination? And how did that happen? Well, it wasn\u2019t until I was in the last couple of years of my rabbinic school education \u2014 it\u2019s a five-year graduate program \u2014 that I began to realize that most of the ideas that I was fascinated by had something to do with mystical characters. And the ideas that they talked about \u2014 I finally went to my professor at the time, Jacob Petachovski. His memory is a blessing. And said something like, in his office I said, \u201CJacob, what\u2019s this about mysticism?\u201D And he sort of sat back in his chair and said, \u201COh, I see you\u2019ve discovered something.\u201D And we talked a little bit, and he pulled off the shelf a book by Gershom Scholem, probably his magnum opus. It\u2019s called Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism. And he gave it to me, and I ran home and tried to read it. And at about ten o\u2019clock, I fell asleep, because it\u2019s really tough, serious, heavy Jewish history. But it\u2019s extraordinary. And what Scholem did in that book was that he brought the Jewish mystical tradition to the English-reading public. I want to ask you about some language you use. There\u2019s so many ways to describe what Kabbalah is, what this tradition is, but this is one way you did it. Somewhere you said, \u201CIt is a system of theosophy \u2014 \u201Cattains maturity as a system of theosophy, claiming to explain the influence of human action on the inner life of God.\u201D That\u2019s a very intriguing statement. \u201CThe influence of human action on the inner life of God.\u201D Can you \u2026 It\u2019s delicious, isn\u2019t it? Yes. Say some more about what that means. Well, Scholem again \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to separate out Scholem from Kabbalah, but Scholem comes along and says that the Torah itself claims to be a document describing the inner life of God. And through studying the Torah, one therefore not only learns about how to act, or how to look at the universe, but one realizes that \u2014 you realize immediately that you are reading about the ultimate nature of being, and therefore the DNA of creation, or the warp and woof of the way the world works. And that effectively becomes the inner life of God. Right. I need to back up a little bit because everybody is not in this. So, Ein Sof is \u2014 and, again, this is your language \u2014 \u201Cthe font, the source, the matrix, the motherlode of being.\u201D The original light, right? That original spark, that cosmic seed. \u201CA point of light containing everything yet to come.\u201D And then here is this wonderful way you describe it. You say, \u201CEin Sof is to being what electricity is to the letters and words on a video computer monitor.\u201D Explain that. I think the best way to understand it, Krista, is to remind you of two Hebrew words that are in kabbalistic language much more important than their normal definitions. The first word is yaish. And it\u2019s sort of untranslated. If you held my feet to the fire I\u2019d say it translated as \u201Cis-ness.\u201D \u201CBeing-ness.\u201D And yaish refers to virtually everything in creation. Anything that has a beginning or an end, that has the spatial coordinates, that has a definition, that is bordered by other things. And it\u2019s not just material reality. Love has a beginning, it has an end. Beauty can have a definition. And it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s not something to be renounced. Anybody who has tried to live in the world knows that it is the world of yaish. You and I are yaish. Our microphones are yaish. The room, the city of San Francisco is yaish. Everything is yaish. Yaish is not bad. It\u2019s only bad if you think that\u2019s all there is. Turns out there is only one thing that\u2019s not yaish. It has no beginning, it has no end, it\u2019s not bordered by anything, it has no definition, it has no spatial coordinates. You probably can\u2019t say as much about it as I\u2019m about to try to say. It is the opposite of yaish. It is called Ein Sof\u2014 \u201Cwithout end.\u201D Literally, it means \u201Cnothing,\u201D but with a capital \u201Cn.\u201D Because if I said it was something \u2014 you\u2019ve got to stay with the logic here \u2014 if I said \u201Csomething,\u201D then you will say, \u201CWell, it\u2019s next to another thing.\u201D And the Kabbalists, being serious about logic, also, they are very logical \u2014 no, the only way we can talk about this non-yaish thing is to call it no thing, or nothing. And that becomes Ein Sof, and that has something to do with God, the source of everything of yaish. Everything in the world is made of Ein Sof. Everything in the world is a wave of which the Ein Sof, or God, is the ocean. And our knowledge of the ocean is largely based on the way it manifests itself in the waves \u2014 that is, the yaish. So my closest I can come to learning about Ein Sof and God is by talking to you, or looking at a tree, or planting one. Right. But this understanding of God also defies the containers that religion generally puts God in, or maybe just that our minds put God in, because they are what they are. Because it \u2014 this \u201Cnothing\u201D with a capital \u201Cn\u201D is also everything, right? And this \u2026 And more. Right. And more. So it is God in this conception. I\u2019m using the words I can and I want you to correct me and elaborate, but it is also not a thing, but in everything, and is everything, in this mystical understanding. Let me try it this way. There are two ways to understand our relationship with God. I\u2019m going to say right up front that they are both just metaphors. Relax. Just metaphors. The first one \u2014 picture a big circle, and the big circle represents God. And then picture below it a very tiny, little circle. And that represents you in the world. And because the big circle is above the little circle, it\u2019s naturally hierarchical, and, therefore, it\u2019s generically masculine and welcome to Western religion. All of Western religions have this thing. \u201CGod\u2019s up there, and we are down here, and we talk to God, and God tells us what to do, blah, blah, blah.\u201D You didn\u2019t mention the beard on that circle. Right, but it\u2019s not far. There was a cartoon recently in The New Yorker. It shows two angels and the big guy talking without a beard. And one says to the other, \u201CI just can\u2019t take him seriously without the beard anymore.\u201D OK, so that\u2019s the one. We all know that picture. OK. That\u2019s the one we all know, and you and all of our listeners could easily talk at length about that. Now I\u2019m going to give you another metaphor. Just another metaphor. Relax. Same big circle that represents God, but the only difference is that the little circle that represents you and me is inside the big circle. And that is a more Eastern \u2014 it strikes us as a more Eastern model, but it\u2019s \u2014 as Scholem demonstrated \u2014 it\u2019s widely available in Western religious tradition, as well. And the goal in that model is not to pray to God or have God tell you what to do, but to realize that you have been, all along, contrary to all of your illusions, a dimension of the divine. And in moments of heightened spiritual awareness, the boundary line, which is the little circle defining you inside the big circle, momentarily is erased, momentarily is blurred, and it\u2019s no longer clear where you end and God begins. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, exploring the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah. I actually want to quote you at yourself again, because this is so wonderful. \u201CThis is a definition of a mystic: A mystic is anyone who has the gnawing suspicion that the apparent discord, brokenness, contradictions, and discontinuities that assault us every day might conceal a hidden unity.\u201D Yeah, I like that a lot. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to nailing it down. Yeah. So, it\u2019s wonderful to ponder, and we don\u2019t have the luxury here of just being quiet and pondering it. But maybe people who are listening on the podcast can push pause. But it also raises these very mysterious questions, right? That conception. I think that, for me, the starting point for trying to make sense out of these very slippery ideas \u2014 William James in his masterful \u2014 not Jewish \u2014 \u201COn Mysticism\u201D identifies the four characteristics of a mystical experience. The first \u2014 let\u2019s see if I can remember all four. The first is that they\u2019re transient. These mystical moments. They come and go according to their own timetables and for their own reasons. You have a mystical experience, there\u2019s nothing you can do to guarantee a mystical experience, and anybody who says he can guarantee one for you is a quack. The second characteristic James identified is that you\u2019re passive. You don\u2019t have the experience, it has you. All of a sudden, whoa, what was that? Something has changed. The third is that the experience is noetic. That means that there is intellectual content to it, but, unfortunately, that leads us to the fourth. It is ineffable. You can\u2019t put it into words. I want to add just one more thing before we go on. The kind of mystical experiences that I\u2019m talking about are not where the roof flies off the building, revealing the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing Handel\u2019s \u201CHallelujah\u201D chorus and light streams out of your facial apertures and you get a new name. I hope that would happen for you, and for me, it hasn\u2019t yet. I\u2019m 70. The odds are against it. What I would rather talk about is \u2014 I would call them \u201Cquickie, everyday, garden-variety moments,\u201D in which nothing big happens and that, if you weren\u2019t looking for it, you might have just thought it was something you ate, or drank, or smoked. What was that? And then you go on. But I am increasingly convinced that mystical seekers are able to have that moment where they lose themselves in the divine, all the unio mystical experience, several times a day. Fleeting. Casual. It\u2019s interesting, the timing of this interview with you, because just yesterday I was invited to be on one of the major talk shows in New York City, Brian Lehrer. And he chose as his topic, actually, religious experience. And it very quickly got into mystical experience, and the experience people have of God, which is, actually, really, not even a sentence that\u2019s spoken much on public radio or in our other intellectually \u2026 And you don\u2019t get invited to dinner parties if you start talking that way. No, you don\u2019t. But what I\u2019m going to tell you, and what will not surprise you at all \u2014 he offered for his listeners \u2014 this is on WNYC in New York \u2014 to share experiences they\u2019ve had. And of course the phone lines completely just filled up. And the few people who are able to come on, they talked about this \u201Cgarden-variety experience\u201D that was completely transformative, very brief, and very, let\u2019s say, organic. And each of them actually described very much this definition that you gave about \u2014 the separation fell away. The sense of separation fell away. And it was this knowledge, this experience of a vividness and a unity. And even as I describe \u2014 as I tell about it, it sounds suspect in a way that it didn\u2019t when they were describing the moment. It\u2019s a handful of smoke. Yeah, it\u2019s real hard to talk about. But it\u2019s the most important thing to talk about. My suspicion is, and I don\u2019t know who \u2014 I think it may have been Moshe Idel, one of Scholem\u2019s best students, I\u2019m not sure of this\u00A0\u2014 said that \u201Cwhatever it is that makes religion religion, mysticism has more of it.\u201D It seems to be freeze-dried, it seems to be intensified, focused. It\u2019s the name of the game. It\u2019s the very center of what we are talking about. Because, to be sure, mysticism is intensely personal, and that\u2019s what it always winds up doing for people. But, again, back to religious terms, to say that God is not just in everything, but God is everything, and that occasionally human beings apprehend that \u2014 it also makes God much more messy. Gershom Scholem said, \u201CThe price of God\u2019s purity is the loss of his living reality.\u201D But it does also cast aspersions on God\u2019s purity. You\u2019ve said it raises these questions. If God all there is, then why did God make the world? And if God made the world, how did God do it? And here\u2019s the hard one: if God is perfect, but the world is not, then what went wrong? Well, so many of those classic questions and conundra come from trying to make lived-experience sense out of \u201CGod is out there and we are down here.\u201D And most people crash and burn on that. I guess that\u2019s why I became a mystic. If you think about the other circle, and we are within the divine, it poses, obviously, different problems. We solve some, and it makes new problems. But the minute you say it\u2019s all God, then you\u2019re stuck with stuff you don\u2019t usually want to say is God, like pimples, and dirt, and what the dog left on the sidewalk, and Adolph Hitler. My question would be, if you say, no, that\u2019s not God, then I\u2019m going to say to you, well, who made it, then? You mean there\u2019s somebody else out there making just some junk and throwing it into the mix? You don\u2019t have that option. So what is the mystic\u2019s, the Kabbalist\u2019s response or reflection on the dirt, or Adolph Hitler? What are the questions that this tradition asks? Well, any attempt to just explain those things quickly is going to be a disaster, obviously. Yeah, but it\u2019s not the \u201CWhere was God?\u201D question. That\u2019s the separation question. That\u2019s the \u201CGod is up there and we\u2019re down here.\u201D Just because it\u2019s God doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not obligated to go on doing the best you can with the brain God gave you. And so that doesn\u2019t mean, therefore, that you should roll over and play dead, or ignore dirt or filth or terrible things in the world. You\u2019re still obligated to do what you\u2019ve got to do. But you have to understand that if there\u2019s evil in me, I can try to banish it and push it away. But I won\u2019t succeed, because it\u2019s part of me. What I need to do is to find something holy even in it, and thereby try to redeem it and free me from it. And I can do the same thing with the world. I\u2019m not creative or spiritually anywhere near big enough to be able to handle it, but I think I have \u2014 this is the right way to go. Well, therefore, everything in the world that I don\u2019t like is there. I don\u2019t deny its existence, especially if I say it\u2019s a manifestation of God. It raises a challenge for me, though. What can I do to redeem even this? This terrible thing, or whatever it is. What is holy in it? And I will keep working at it, and that is how I can free myself from it. You can listen again and share this conversation with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner through our website. And this conversation is part of a larger exploration of the living legacy of the great 20th-century historian of Jewish and other mystical traditions, Gershom Scholem. Learn more at onbeing.org. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner says that the Jewish moral commandment, tikkun olam, is not so accurately translated \u201Crepair the world\u201D as \u201Crepair the cosmos.\u201D Here is the most memorable way the Kabbalistic connection between Ein Sof and human moral action has been told to me across the years \u2014 by the physician Rachel Naomi Remen, as her grandfather told it to her: In the beginning, there was only the holy darkness, the Ein Sof, the source of life. And then, in the course of history, at a moment in time, this world, the world of a thousand, thousand things, emerged from the heart of the holy darkness as a great ray of light. And then, perhaps because this is a Jewish story, there was an accident, and the vessels containing the light of the world, the wholeness of the world, broke. And the wholeness of the world, the light of the world was scattered into a thousand, thousand fragments of light, and they fell into all events and all people, where they remain deeply hidden until this very day. Now, according to my grandfather, the whole human race is a response to this accident. We are here because we are born with the capacity to find the hidden light in all events and all people, to lift it up and make it visible once again and thereby to restore the innate wholeness of the world. It\u2019s a very important story for our times. And this task is called tikkun olam in Hebrew. It\u2019s the restoration of the world. And this is, of course, a collective task. It involves all people who have ever been born, all people presently alive, all people yet to be born. We are all healers of the world. And that story opens a sense of possibility. It\u2019s not about healing the world by making a huge difference. It\u2019s about healing the world that touches you, that\u2019s around you. Rachel Naomi Remen. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. More conversation with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner when On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner about the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah. We\u2019re exploring his wisdom as part of the living legacy of the 20th-century historian Gershom Scholem, who resurrected Kabbalah for modern scholarship and spiritual renewal. As Rabbi Kushner says, Judaism had largely torn the pages of Kabbalah out of its history books in its response to the Enlightenment. There\u2019s something intriguing to me in \u2014 we\u2019re having this conversation here in the 21st century, and in an interesting way, kind of coming out of the 20th century and all its great plans and ideals and rationalism, there\u2019s a new curiosity and hunger, and I think especially in new generations, there\u2019s this sense that things are more complicated \u2014 differently complicated than we made them. Well, it\u2019s \u2014 enter Gershom Scholem. It\u2019s so important for people to realize that for virtually all of the 19th and the first half, two thirds of the 20th century, mysticism was widely considered to be nothing more than folk magic and superstition unbefitting an enlightened 20th-century thinker. And it all grew from the prevailing intellectual attitude in Germany in the 19th century. It goes under the name of Wissenschaft des Judentums. Right. The science of Judaism. Scientific study of Judaism. It had to be rational and these guys went into apoplectic shock when they found out what mystics thought and what they did. And the result was that they simply, as I mentioned before, tore all the pages of Kabbalah out of the history books, and didn\u2019t even allow anybody to pay attention to it. When Saul Lieberman, the great scholar at the Jewish Theological Seminary, was asked to introduce Gershom Scholem once\u2026 Oh, I need to give you a Hebrew word to get the joke. The Hebrew word shtus. It means folly, nonsense, insanity, madness, idolatry, stupidity. Shtuss. It\u2019s junk. So, Lieberman introduced Scholem the following way. \u201CShtuss is shtuss, but the academic study of shtus is scholarship.\u201D And then he sat down. That\u2019s what Scholem was up against. That the reigning intellectual community thought it was all just so much shtuss. So much nonsense, silliness. Who would care about it at all, except some historian like Scholem trying to figure this stuff out? And there\u2019s even an echo with the emergence of Kabbalah in the 13th century, right? There was that rational Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages that this Jewish mysticism kind of arose as a response to \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right, as a response to. Well, I think historically, Krista \u2014 and a lot of this is in Scholem, although some of it is just me trying to figure out a way to make things make sense \u2014 we have \u2014 in world history, there\u2019s a sense that when religion becomes too formal, too rigid, too structured, too logical, the only way to bust it open and get something decent going instead, is for mysticism to reappear. Because whatever religion you\u2019re talking about, on whatever scale you\u2019re talking about, the minute mysticism becomes permissible, acceptable, possible, it\u2019s an immediate threat to organized religious structures. Because what mysticism does is it gives everybody direct, unmediated personal access to God. And then they say to whoever\u2019s running the local religious community, I don\u2019t need you. I\u2019ve got God directly. So it winds up being an explosion of chaos. Scholem used the word \u201Canarchy,\u201D that mysticism creates an anarchic situation, and it\u2019s healthy and it\u2019s part of growing. Right. This idea of mysticism as a resource for change and development within religion. And just to take this outside Judaism \u2014 and I think it\u2019s very interesting that Scholem did. He really was fascinated and took seriously mysticism as a human experience, right? He was rooted in Jewish mysticism, but he saw the parallels in other traditions. And so, right now, within Christianity, the fastest growing face of Christianity is Pentecostalism, which\u00A0\u2014 one sociologist I\u2019ve spoken with gave this, I think, a wonderful name \u2014 Pentecostals are \u201Cmain-street mystics.\u201D And it is kind of turning Christianity inside-out in very interesting ways. Well, I know it\u2019s messing up Judaism. I don\u2019t know enough about contemporary Christianity. Well, say some more about what it\u2019s doing with Judaism. And you mean the rise in mystical curiosity, openness, to this? Or what do you mean by that? Well, let\u2019s identify \u2014 there are three kinds of Kabbalah, at least. Maybe a couple more, too. But one kind of Kabbalah is called Kabbalah musari, and it is ethical Kabbalah. For some reason \u2014 and no scholar to my knowledge has really done the work on this \u2014 but after the appearance of the Zohar, 12th, 13th century, virtually every manual of ethical discipline written within Judaism, was written by a practicing Kabbalist. That, to me, is an extraordinary statement, especially since mysticism gets such bad press. \u201COh, they\u2019re anarchists. You can\u2019t trust them to do good things.\u201D Yeah, or \u201CIt\u2019s purely spiritual,\u201D right? As opposed to being \u2026 Beam me up, Scotty, float away. Yeah. I think when you think about it, it makes perfect sense. You don\u2019t have an experience that is unitive in which you feel yourself dissolved into the divine all, and emerge from that wanting to rip somebody off. Your immediate desire is to show them how to get there with you. And so forth. The second kind of Kabbalah is called Kabbalah ma\u2019asit. Or what in Jewish history is called \u201Cpractical Kabbalah.\u201D If Krista has an experience of the divine, she now presumably, in some dim sense, also has an insight into the inner workings of creation and how everything functions together. And it might be tempting for her \u2014 not you, I\u2019m just making this up, of course \u2014 might be tempting for her to use this new knowledge as a way of, well, maybe figuring out which stock to buy, or which stock to sell, or how real estate is going to go, or maybe to help Timmy who\u2019s sick in the hospital get better. So kind of as magic. Mysticism as magic. Yeah. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s a whole lot of people who think that\u2019s all Kabbalah is, and it\u2019s superstition and hocus pocus and all. And the third kind of Kabbalah, which is mainly what Scholem talks about, and which most students of Kabbalah of these times, like myself, is called Kabbalah iyunit, or \u201Ctheoretical Kabbalah.\u201D And that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve been talking about. Kabbalah is a way to do Judaism. It\u2019s Judaism on steroids. You can\u2019t do another religion and do Kabbalah at the same time, because Kabbalah only makes sense as a system for making sense out of \u2014 a heightened sense out of classical Judaism. I guess I\u2019m interested in your perspective on \u2014 we also live in one of these ages where we\u2019re kind of hung over from rationalism and secularism, but not with a lot of the same entry points that other generations had into religion. And I want to ask this question in a positive way, but what do you experience this mysticism and this mystical tradition to offer to 21st-century people? Oy. \u201CTo offer.\u201D What an annoying question. Well, do you know what I \u2014 I understand why it\u2019s annoying. No, I hear you. What is it that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not the right word, either. Well, OK. What is it that\u2019s attractive \u2014 that\u2019s not a good word, either. Well, the old saw is that, for our purposes, we would say old-time religion wants to know what God wants us to do, whereas a mystical variety of the same spiritual tradition would say, no, I want to know what God knows. I want to see the world through God\u2019s eyes. I want to lose myself in the divine all. That\u2019s how I want to experience God. That\u2019s how I want to make sense out of religion. And, your question in that sense, what\u2019s so annoying is it\u2019s just very, very perceptive. I mean, old-time religion \u2014 God\u2019s up there, we\u2019re down here, God says this, we pray to God for that \u2014 just doesn\u2019t seem to cut it for most of the people I talk to. Most of the people that were seriously into religion are seriously interested in experiencing the divine. The language is important. One could argue that what we\u2019re witnessing is the pendulum shift from the extreme, sometimes destructive rationalism of the past couple of centuries and returning to a more balanced view of religious life. And mysticism is the way home. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, exploring the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah. We don\u2019t have much time left, but I want to just talk a little bit about some of the other really intriguing aspects of Kabbalah and Jewish mystical tradition. This notion that creation \u2014 this is not just mystical, but I think Kabbalah really emphasizes it \u2014 that creation is not something that happened once but is an ongoing act \u2013 that \u201Ccreation is now,\u201D I think is how you said it once. Yeah, it\u2019s the doctrine of a continuous creation. God can\u2019t remember anything. It doesn\u2019t mean that God\u2019s above a certain age. Just means God can\u2019t remember anything. And God has no hopes for the future, because \u2014 I love this \u2014 there is no such thing as time for God. God experiences the past, the present, and the future as one present, continuous reality. And so that means that, for us, the world\u2019s coming into being is, as we said before, continuous. And we come close to God when we are willing to experience the world in the same way, that it\u2019s always possible, and that the divine is always present, and it\u2019s only the silly illusion that I\u2019m in business for myself which becomes, in translation, that I made the world, that I\u2019m God, God makes the world, and God\u2019s making it right now. And to really understand the implications of that statement is to have a mystical experience. And the world that we live in now is this brew of curiosity, I think an openness to mystery. And therefore, also to the mystical aspect of our traditions, that kind of cosmic curiosity, alongside very well publicized fundamentalist and literalistic readings of religious tradition. Gershom Scholem did not live to see these particular dynamics. I wonder how you think about what the heart of this mystical tradition \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201Coffer\u201D again \u2014 \u201Chas to offer to the world.\u201D I won\u2019t use that word. How does it speak to this world? And, of course, behind all of that, behind a lot of the fundamentalism and the literalism is a lot of anxiety and fear that is, in fact, reality-based, because there\u2019s a lot to be anxious and fearful about. Well, I think what our generation seems to be living through is the realization that rationalism is only part of the answer. That rationalism can only get you so far. There was a time when people thought it was the answer, and it could get you there. And it\u2019s clear that it won\u2019t get you there. And as a matter of fact \u2014 I think I\u2019m not the first one to notice this \u2014 that Auschwitz and Hiroshima were perfectly rational decisions and behaviors. So there\u2019s this sense that religion has to be more than rationalism. And mysticism offers this, sort of like in the corner, \u201CPsst, hey, kid. How would you like a direct experience of the divine? Would that help your religious life?\u201D And a lot of people discover that they\u2019re mystics after all when they\u2019re given that offer. Can I tell one more story that reminds me \u2026 Yeah, sure. I was leading a tour of the sanctuary, of the prayer hall, with the children in the congregation\u2019s preschool. And then I figured, as a piece de resistance, I\u2019d have them come onto the bima, or the little prayer stage up in front of the room, where there was an ark where we kept the scroll of the Torah. It was accessible via a big floor-to-ceiling curtain. And I got them up on the stage, and I was about to call them \u2014 \u201COpen the ark,\u201D but I saw the teacher at the back tapping her wristwatch, which, as you may know, is an old Talmudic gesture, which means \u201CYour time is about up, bucko.\u201D So, I said, \u201CI tell you what, boys and girls. We\u2019ll come back when we get together again in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ll come back here and I\u2019m going to open that curtain there and show you what\u2019s behind it. It\u2019s very special.\u201D And so they all say, \u201CShalom, Rabbi,\u201D and like little ducklings, follow the teacher back to the class. Well, the next day, the teacher shows up at my office with the following story. Apparently the preceding day\u2019s hastily-concluded lesson has occasioned a fierce debate among the little people as to what is behind the curtain. They didn\u2019t know. And the following four answers are given, which is I think pretty interesting. One kid, obviously destined to become a professor of nihilistic philosophy at a great university, opined that behind that curtain was absolutely nothing. Another kid, less imaginative, thought it had a Jewish holy thing in there. A third kid, obviously a devotee of American game show television subculture, guessed that behind that curtain was a brand new car. And the fourth kid \u2014 and that\u2019s what brings us back to Gershom Scholem and Kabbalah\u00A0\u2014 said, \u201CNo, you\u2019re all wrong. Next week when that rabbi man comes and opens that curtain, behind it, there would be a giant mirror.\u201D From a four-year-old. Somehow, that little soul knew that through looking at the words of sacred scripture, he would encounter himself in a new and a heightened and revealing way. Hmm. That\u2019s lovely. I think that \u2014 I think those are your last words, but unless \u2014 was there anything \u2014 there\u2019s so much we didn\u2019t get to, but is there anything that just must be said to add to this? Well there\u2019s \u2014 there is one other story, if you want me\u2026 Yeah. \u2026if you have \u2014 OK. And it is, actually, the one thing that we didn\u2019t touch on, which is a very important of Scholem\u2019s teaching. As we mentioned before, Judaism and Islam and Christianity are revealed traditions. So, therefore, what happened for all of them at Mt. Sinai is of ultimate importance. Did God talk to Moses? If he did, what did it sound like? Could we have picked it up on a tape recorder? In other words, what is the divine status of those allegedly holy words we find in sacred text? And with Scholem, who \u2014 I found in his book, it was On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism \u2014 I must have read it 50 years ago, it changed my life \u2014 and I subsequently found out it did for most of my colleagues and friends who had read it, also. It turns out that there is a mystical tradition that says that God really didn\u2019t give the whole five books of Moses. God didn\u2019t really give all ten utterances. There\u2019s another tradition that said that God gave just the first two. \u201CI\u2019m the Lord, your God. Don\u2019t have any other gods.\u201D Well, there\u2019s a guy that Scholem found, a Hassid named Mendel Torum of Rimenov. He says, \u201CNo, God didn\u2019t even give the first utterance at Sinai, \u2018I\u2019m the Lord your God.\u2019 God didn\u2019t even give the first word, anokh\u00ED, which is first person pronoun singular \u201CI.\u201D All God gave was the first letter of the first word, which is the Hebrew letter aleph, which most people who know a little bit of Hebrew will quickly say is soundless, but Scholem points out that\u2019s not quite correct. Scholem points out, as a matter of fact, that the sound of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which coincidentally has the numerical equivalent of one, is actually the noise that your larynx makes as it clicks into gear. It\u2019s a teeny, little, barely audible click. And that\u2019s what God gave at Mt. Sinai. And Scholem comments upon that at great length, of course. He says that Mendel Torum of Rimenov\u2019s clever teaching makes the revelation a mystical one, says that what happened at Mt. Sinai was barely audible and had no particular sound, and it therefore became the job of, in this case, Moses, the prophet, or of anyone else, to give human content to that otherwise unpronounceable sound. The Zohar says that the aleph is a seed in which is enwrapped the entire Torah. And what it means to be a religious person, is to spend your life unpacking that seed. Hmm. Yeah. I am aware of that, and it\u2019s just so huge that I didn\u2019t know if we could do it any kind of justice, but I think your story did open it up. Well, thank you. I just also have to say that I feel like there\u2019s so much resonance with things we\u2019re learning now that feel unconnected. The emphasis on naming, and letters, and even the Golem traditions of using letters that gives life, and then we\u2019re working with DNA, which is about letters. Even the one, the aleph, and the one, the \u2014 not the Ein Sof, but the \u2014 say it again. Sephirot? It\u2019s numbers \u2026 Sephirot. Sephirot, \u201Cinfrastructure of reality.\u201D I feel like there are so many echoes with this mystical tradition, and these cutting-edge things we\u2019re learning on our, in fact, our frontiers of rationalism. Talking with you convinces me even more that Scholem was extraordinarily important. Because he brought this stuff to light. He read this stuff. He read it in manuscripts that weren\u2019t accessible to anybody and they were written often in dialects and styles of the language that few people could read or understood. And he left it to us an inheritance. And it seems \u2014 from the questions that you\u2019re asking of me, too \u2014 seems to be a way that we have of finding our way home again. The epigraph that I chose for my novel, Kabbalah: A Love Story, is from Scholem. He says: \u201CIn none of their systems did the Kabbalists fail to stress the interrelation of all worlds and levels of being. Everything is connected with everything else. And this interpenetration of all things is governed by exact, though unfathomable laws.\u201D We have the gnawing suspicion in our generation now, Krista, that everything is connected. And every now and then, we are given a glimpse, a tickle, a whisper, that maybe it, indeed, is. And that\u2019s what religious people seem to be most interested in appropriately doing, which is finding more and more connections so that it\u2019s impossible to do anything independent of something else. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner is a scholar-in-residence at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco. His many books include God Was In This Place & I, i Did Not Know, Kabbalah: A Love Story, and I\u2019m God, You\u2019re Not. You can listen again and share this show at onbeing.org. And there you\u2019ll find our complete remembrance of the legacy of Gershom Scholem \u2014 including an interview with Zvi Leshem, the director of the Gershom Scholem Library at the National Library of Israel. The collection houses over 25,000 books, many of them rare Kabbalistic texts rescued by Scholem. Here\u2019s his voice: When I started to study Kabbalistic texts, this was a rather curious and, to most people, an enigmatic undertaking. I was attracted, you know, some of you being psychologists, nobody knows what is going on in the hidden recesses of a man\u2019s mind. Somehow, having studied Judaism, I thought, \u201CThere must be something more.\u201D We\u2019ve also posted some archival audio of Scholem from a conference he attended in 1975, alongside a recommended list for further reading by both Gershom Scholem and Rabbi Lawrence Kushner. Again, find all of that at onbeing.org."
