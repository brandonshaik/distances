  "fullText": "The human condition is caught between two poles. I\u2019m part of the world and I\u2019m separate from the world. But I believe philosophy becomes true when it\u2019s anchored in the intimacy of your life. I think within the concrete. I remember my students saying to me, \u201CRabbi Hartman, I want you to know, but don\u2019t get upset with me. I became an atheist.\u201D I said, \u201CWhen did you become an atheist?\u201D He said, \u201CWednesday.\u201D \u201COh, boy, that\u2019s a remarkable thing. What were you Tuesday? You were a believer, right? And what happened on Thursday?\u201D I said, \u201CIs there any difference between the way you lived when you were a believer and when you became an atheist?\u201D And that\u2019s the criterion for me. \u201CThe champion of adaptive Judaism.\u201D That was the headline of The New York Times\u2019 obituary for Rabbi David Hartman, who died a year ago this week. He was called a \u201Cpublic philosopher for the Jewish people,\u201D He was a charismatic and unusual figure in Israeli society \u2014 an Orthodox rabbi who both loved and challenged traditional Judaism from the inside. He did this as a sacred obligation to his understanding of the core values Judaism brings into the world, for all of humanity. He became an activist for example, of the inclusion of women in orthodox ritual and practice, seeing this not as a matter of or for women but about the character of the God one worships. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Rabbi David Hartman led a modern Orthodox synagogue in Montreal before moving with his wife and five children to Israel in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of 1967. And in Jerusalem over three decades ago, he founded the Shalom Hartman Institute, named after his father. This modern campus is built with stones from the nearby Judean Hills. It hosts secular Israeli military officers, Arab thinkers, and liberal and traditional rabbis. I interviewed Rabbi Hartman there in 2011. Where I\u2019d like to start is truly at the beginning of you. Were you raised in an Orthodox family? Yes. So this has been your tradition all your life? No. I\u2019ve been \u2014 I was brought up in a very Hasidic family and I went to Orthodox schools. I was a nice religious boy until I began to read [laughs]and that all changed [laughs]. What did you read that changed you? William James, John Dewey, American pragmatism. They grabbed me. Also, Peter Berger and Brown. And how did those kinds of writers start to change your Jewish sensibility? No, you see, I was already moving away from conventional Orthodoxy. I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answers. And with William James, I met a finite God, which was a pleasure. So, well, God was limited because, if I looked at the world \u2014 I mean, he sure is not omnipotent because, if that\u2019s what his power is, then he sure is a very weak God. So in other words, I could never build the theology ignoring the lived reality. I always, in my own crazy way, would go through, when there was a plane crash or a car crash and I\u2019m told that there was a bride and groom on the plane and I pictured what was their conversation: Where we going to live? How many children do you think we should have? And then planning and thinking. Then snafu. It\u2019s like laughing at human beings attempt to take life seriously. Either God has a sense of humor or he\u2019s not there. He\u2019s there and not there. So in some way, we have to develop new metaphors, new images, of how we think about God. It\u2019s not enough to say Judaism is the religion of the law. We have the law, so we know what we\u2019re supposed to do. That doesn\u2019t work for me. Because if the law doesn\u2019t point to a God, then what is it all about? You know, much of your writing and certainly this latest book you\u2019ve written, The God Who Hates Lies, it\u2019s an intra-Jewish conversation that you are aspiring for, leading, provoking. And it\u2019s provocative and critical, but from a perspective of loving and living deeply inside the tradition. I\u2019d like for us to talk about that, but be aware of the fact that people who are listening, say, my listeners in the United States, don\u2019t know the dynamics of this internal conversation. And also, I think when Jews are critical of each other, when this critical Israeli conversation is transmitted, that loving and living in the depths piece of it is lost. So I\u2019m just wondering if we can kind of go inside that conversation that you\u2019re part of. You see, I see my identity as deeply tied to a family. I\u2019m very deeply Jewish. My mannerisms, whatever it may be, I mean, I was brought up with Jewish music, my father, the institute is called after him. He was very poor, but he celebrated the Shabbat with joy. So I have deep memories, Jewishly. So I have never had the desire to leave. I had the desire that it should be better, so my criticism grows from love. It\u2019s like I was once told, don\u2019t be critical as your mother-in-law who enjoys to find out things that are lacking in you , but be critical out of compassion, out of real love for what you think the people could be. And as I suffered that, because on one level I want to feel empathy, intimacy, with these people with its history, with its longing, and I know its vulnerabilities, its weaknesses, its psychological problems of wanting to be loved. They want so much to be loved and it\u2019s not working. And they don\u2019t know why does the world hate them. What did we do? So they used to say, \u201CIt\u2019s Christ killers.\u201D No, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s much deeper, and on a certain level, Jews are very aggressive and powerful and intellectually, but deep down, they are very frightened. You were a congregational rabbi for 16 years, is that right? Before you came to Israel in Montreal? And you wrote that you, at that time, \u201Cspoke excitedly about the religious significance of a society not only shaped by the Jewish people, or even a Jewish ethos in a general sense, but organized politically around the creative contemporary application of biblical and rabbinic categories of social justice.\u201D Then you encountered the reality of life, right? And the human condition? Right. Yes. Like you wake up in the morning, you hear that a family were murdered. So how do you live with that, you know? And Israelis just want the world to say we feel your pain. They\u2019re so hungry for acknowledgement. They\u2019re so hungry for human responses to them. See, I felt that Jews entered history now affected by the totality of life, economics, politics, medical ethics. In other words, Judaism was not going to be a religion of the synagogue or the kosher home or kosher bakeries. It was going to be the Sitz im Leben of the lived reality of people in business, in violence. I remember the Quakers coming to see me. They wanted to know about my views of power, you know, Quakers. So I said, if you have power, you can have a moral argument. If you\u2019re powerless, there\u2019s no moral argument. So if we want to engage the Palestinians in a moral argument of how to live together, then we can only negotiate if we\u2019re strong. So I have no difficulty even though I\u2019m not a militant person. I have no difficulty of Israel being strong because I feel strength invites discussion; weakness invites manipulation. I wonder if your perspective as a \u2014 or if the sensibility you bring to this as a philosopher also, I mean, because really what you\u2019re talking about is the human condition, the difficulty of the human condition, then in the context of this difficult national and religious identity. Well, that\u2019s the \u2014 the human condition is caught between two poles. I\u2019m part of the world and I\u2019m separate from the world. I\u2019m a member of a family that is not typical of the world and yet I want to embrace all of humanity because, to me, the idea of God creates the widest range of empathy for human beings. Beloved is man created in the image of God. Now on that level \u2014 but I believe philosophy becomes true when it\u2019s anchored in the intimacy of your life. I think within the concrete. That\u2019s what James and Dewey did for me. What\u2019s the cash value of an idea? I remember my students saying to me, \u201CRabbi Hartman, I want you to know, but don\u2019t get upset with me. I became an atheist.\u201D I said, \u201CWhen did you become an atheist?\u201D He said, \u201CWednesday.\u201D \u201COh, boy, that\u2019s a remarkable thing. What were you Tuesday? You were a believer, right? And what happened on Thursday?\u201D I said, \u201CIs there any difference between the way you lived when you were a believer and when you became an atheist?\u201D And that\u2019s the criterion for me. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today \u2013 my interview with the late American-Israeli philosopher and Rabbi David Hartman. Your daughter, um \u2026 Tova. Tova is part of what some people call the Orthodox feminist revolution. Some language you used about that, about how your thinking changed towards this, towards thinking about women and Judaism, you said, was when you realized she was \u201Cnot merely fighting for women\u2019s rights, but for an honest, authentic Judaism\u201D \u2014 that this was not about women, but about the type of God you could worship. Correct. In other words, Tova once said to me, \u201CAbba, the problem with women in Judaism is not a woman\u2019s problem. It\u2019s your problem. It\u2019s the Judaism that you want to be committed to.\u201D Now do you want to be committed to a Judaism in which the woman is not a person? She could be a great surgeon during the week in Hadassah, she comes to the shul, she\u2019s not part of the minyan, she\u2019s not part of the quorum. I remember a rabbi calling me, says, \u201CDavid, what should I do? I come to the shul in the morning and some people have to say Kaddish, which requires a quorum of 10 men. I only get nine and I get seven women.\u201D When Orthodoxy denies the personhood, it commits spiritual suicide. It is blind to the human condition, to the dignity of human beings. I can\u2019t see a Judaism that flourishes and consider the woman in a second-rate, very limited legal powers, etc. And this is a discussion you\u2019re having within Orthodox Judaism in Israel? Correct. That\u2019s the family. Once I became aware of the depth \u2014 and I\u2019m grateful to Tova for educating me because she\u2019s a real expert in gender studies \u2014 once it hit me, I couldn\u2019t accept all the apologetics. And, of course, this is not just a Jewish phenomenon. I know. We have \u2014 this is \u2014 there are aspects of Christianity, of all the traditions that have this. You know this tradition. You know it in its depths, you know its texts and its teachings. I mean, does Orthodox Judaism have the capacity to make this transition as a tradition? Yes. One of the things, I wrote a chapter in my book A Heart of Many Rooms, \u201CJudaism as an Interpretive Tradition.\u201D Interpretation is not just for sake of the law. It\u2019s to define the reality of the religious world. Who is God? Who God is, right. Whose God? Depends on how you interpret it. And I want to bring God back into the interpretive tradition because people will say. \u201CHartman is talking about God so much. What happened to him? What\u2019s this God-intoxicated stuff?\u201D They\u2019ll get scared. So what I\u2019m saying is I want to have God in all aspects of reality and to have that consciousness that you\u2019re living in the presence of God should define your moral action. In other words, I don\u2019t need legalisms to bring about changes. OK. You got that? I don\u2019t need these legal shenanigans. I want to bring the person in existential confrontation with the God consciousness. And then I think you\u2019re saying that the legalisms then must be reconstructed, reinterpreted. Correct. In accordance with that rather than the other way around. That\u2019s correct. Rather than that we interpret God by way of the legalisms. I\u2019m a mother too; I have two children. And I love it that it\u2019s your daughter who brought this to you. I\u2019ve heard other stories of this across the years, Christian and Jewish stories, children who force their parents to revisit the teachings. I just wondered if \u2014 I thought you might have an answer to this. Does the tradition have teachings about how we should be open to being changed and taught by our children? Well, it\u2019s either point. The tradition has models of people changing their mind. The tradition has models of the vitality of disagreements, that one point of view is not the truth. And the notion of philosophy is not truth, but possibilities. Philosophy opens up windows. It doesn\u2019t give you final truths. I want to have a Judaism that opens up windows. You could breath. You want to convert to Judaism? Try it, try it. See how it fits you. Walk around in the streets and say, \u201CI\u2019m Jewish.\u201D See how you feel about it. In other words, I have a great respect for experimentation, to learning from experience. And what experience could give you, no major work of philosophy can give you. I want the human being to be touched by another human being. So as I conduct my life of conversation and as I look at the world, I feel that the teachings about the other, how to encounter the other, how to engage the other, how to treat the other, should be \u2014 should be \u2014 a great gift to the 21st century, that the world needs to learn in a whole new way how to live with the other. It seems to me that you\u2019ve really engaged with that teaching of the other in Judaism. Does that even float into your thinking about women and your changing idea about women? And I wonder how you think about that teaching of the other in terms of the Palestinian people and that this life in Jerusalem and in Israel in the Middle East. It\u2019s hard. That\u2019s so painful. I remember NBC came to see me. They say, \u201CWe heard that you\u2019ve changed in your attitude towards the Palestinians, you know, that you\u2019ve become now militant.\u201D It was Tom Brokaw who came to see me. I said, \u201CDepends what time of day. In the morning I hate the Palestinians. Four hours later I\u2019m much calmer. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. I want to live with them. In other words, I am constantly moved up and back. When my family gets killed and my family\u2019s frightened to go to sleep at night, I get angry. I have a lot of anger in me, but part of my tradition is to learn how to control that anger. And I don\u2019t know if they really want to live with me. I\u2019m not certain that there\u2019s anything we can do that would make it possible for them to feel we acknowledge their dignity. There are other sides of this, right? I mean we were last night at a dinner with Yosi Klein Halevi your colleague. Some American, young Journalism students from California, they had just spent part of the day in East Jerusalem and they were just observing the contrast between the economic dignity of Palestinian neighborhoods and Israeli neighborhoods. This is another side of this, what I would like to get a better sense of, there is this dynamic of a threat, right? And then there is the question of how you apply the teachings of the other to just basic treatment of Palestinians, even citizens of Israel. Right? Is that whole dynamic. I pray for the well being of Palestinians. I have no joy at all if a Palestinian suffers That\u2019s not where I am. But I say to them please, we could really build a nice society together. Can\u2019t you try? Why do you have to feel that there is a, we\u2019re trying to Jew you, as they say? Why can\u2019t you trust us for a little while? A little while, 20 years. I mean we could flourish together beautifully. It could be an example to the world about living with the other, really living. Right I can\u2019t fool myself. I have no other place to go. I\u2019ve lost too many people. German Jews who trusted, you know, and I saw what happened. So I don\u2019t trust the world. I want to trust the world. I say Hartman, come on get it straight. It depends on what time of the day you ask me. It\u2019s living with this tremendous tense emotions. Love hate ambivalence is a phenomenon. Right. I want to talk about another \u2014 you know, just to shift gears \u2014 another interesting thing that you\u2019re bringing about that I\u2019ve heard about: senior military officers who are coming here for study and bringing real-world ethical spiritual questions, and then you\u2019re meeting that with the tradition. I love that. I love them. I think, for people outside Israel, what would be surprising is how unusual and groundbreaking that is, right? Beg your pardon? I think, for people outside Israel who don\u2019t know the dynamics here, that it might be surprising that that\u2019s groundbreaking. No, I think this is, for me, my most beautiful experience in Israel. I look at them and I say, \u201CYou know, you\u2019re the true rabbis in Israel because you are affecting all your troops.\u201D They woke up that Israelism and nationalism ain\u2019t enough. That can\u2019t satisfy the soul of a people and the soldiers themselves say we have to know why we\u2019re fighting. What is it about? Why are we connected to this land? How do we connect ourselves to Jewish history? And they are marvelous. The best audience in the world. I mean, I love them. What kinds of questions do they bring? What? What kinds of questions do they bring? What do they want to talk about? They want to know do you accept me as a Jew even though I\u2019m not observant? How do you look upon me? I say, \u201CYou\u2019re not secular.\u201D \u201CBut everyone tells me I\u2019m secular.\u201D I say, \u201CYou can\u2019t be secular because you\u2019re willing to die for the continuity of Jewish history. That\u2019s very deeply religious.\u201D So immediately, there\u2019s a certain sense that, OK, I\u2019m inside. I\u2019m not an outsider. Take me on a trip. Tell me about Abraham. Tell me about Moses. Tell me about Maimonides. Come on, let\u2019s walk together and I\u2019m open to any questions you may have. I mean they\u2019ll ask me. Why is it my Russian friend who was here and he got killed, and they didn\u2019t know if they could bury him in a Jewish cemetery. So the question they all ask themselves if they\u2019re willing to accept him to die for this country, they can\u2019t bury him as a Jew. There is such a disharmony a fracture between the rabbinic establishment or the so called public voices of Judaism and what really is true Judaism. And they\u2019re looking for true Judaism. Something they can love and respect. It is very beautiful to see. They want to respect it. It is not like my congregation in Montreal when I was a Rabbi. I mean here it\u2019s the nicest audience I could speak to because they are so hungry. That\u2019s what kills me. I know the country is open to a renaissance of spiritual moral values and the Rabbis kill it. We have a Rabbi in it that has absolutely no connection to the people, no understanding of Jewish history, no understanding of the Zionist revolution. You have written about, and I think this absolutely comes through, that you criticize Israel as a parent, or Jews as a parent \u2014 engages with the child. It\u2019s a loving criticism. And you have written that the backdrop to that is daily joy and celebration. Would you say some more about the totality of this relationship you have. Your ideas, what you find lacking, your sense of possibility? Well I find lacking joy, depth, critical reflection, changing your mind and not being scared to think new thoughts. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see and it ain\u2019t there. You wrote, \u201CI propose that a core meaning of the state of Israel is precisely the will of the Jewish people to remain in history despite overwhelming evidence of the risks involved.\u201D Tell me what you\u2019re saying there? Well you know the risks. Yeah, I know the risks. It\u2019s the staying in history. The staying here. We\u2019re vulnerable to Syria, Iran, Hezbollah. I mean they don\u2019t send me love notes. They tell me that they are going to get new forms of destruction and they could wipe out Tel Aviv in a few hours. I look at this institute I worked so hard to build it, I had to raise all the money myself. My son Donniel now came and inherited the throne. But i worked very hard to build what I built. I don\u2019t want to lose it. I always have these nightmares of bombs falling away here. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, the fragile quality of life drives me crazy. Today you\u2019re here, today you smile, today you make love and tomorrow you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be. You know that non-consistency. And a new king arose in Egypt who didn\u2019t know Joseph. That\u2019s my vision of history. No matter what you did, they forgot. Look what we have contributed to civilization. Yeah ok, but that\u2019s for yesterday\u2019s news. You can listen again and share this conversation with Rabbi David Hartman through our website, onbeing.org. There you can also find all the shows that came out of our 2011 production trip to Israel and the West Bank. They included Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh; Israeli journalist Yossi Klein Halevi; Mohammad Darawshe, an Arab civic leader of Israel; and voices from the Aida camp, a Palestinian refugee camp and neighborhood in Bethlehem. Together they reveal many faces of Israeli and Palestinian identity \u2013 and humanity. Again, that\u2019s at onbeing.org. Coming up, David Hartman on hope in \u201Ca hopeless God.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today revisiting my 2011 conversation with philosopher and Rabbi, David Hartman. I interviewed him at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, which he founded. He died a year ago this week at the age of 81. Rabbi Hartman was a revered if provocative figure in Israeli society. He convened rare encounters of Jews from different backgrounds \u2014 men and women \u2014 at his institute. These have included, for example, a project of religious and ethical reflection with officers of the Israeli army. Israeli Jews, as Rabbi Hartman described it, walk a constant tightrope between vulnerability and responsibility. One of the large themes in your thinking and writing is how Jewish sovereignty, how the fact of the state of Israel, in fact, challenges Judaism. Absolutely. Because it says to you, stop looking at pots and pans, if it\u2019s dairy or meat. Take your face out of the pot and look, look at the society. The state of Israel gives me a whole range of responsibility. Right. And I can\u2019t now goof off. I can\u2019t blame the goyim. Can\u2019t blame the Gentiles for the world as it is. It\u2019s my world. What type of medicine do you have? What type of treatment of the aged? What type of treatment of immigrants? You are now \u2014 have power and power has to be measured by responsibility, and a sovereign state gives you the opportunity to make Judaism a total way of life that brings dignity and responsiveness to human beings. Sovereignty is an instrument for moral excellence. And I think you\u2019re also saying that the state of Israel is really a new chapter for Jews even beyond the biblical narrative. Correct. Which does not have Jews in charge of their fate. Right. And that in fact then you are writing a new chapter of the tradition, that that\u2019s part of this responsibility you talked about, that may go beyond the bounds of what was possible even to think about or live into. That\u2019s what this whole institute is about. In this institute, Arabs tell me when they come, they said they feel dignified. The workers feel dignified. No one pulls rank on another person. No thinker will ever be told that that\u2019s heretical, you can\u2019t say that. A total freedom of ideas, cross-cultural discussions with theologians, Muslims, Christians, philosophers, seculars. Come on, world. Come inside. We want to meet you. In other words, strangely enough, Israel, which is so much more a family home, makes it possible to be more universal than living in Manhattan. In other words, here I meet people out of a sense of dignity. I have roots. I have a history. I can now meet your history. You\u2019re not denying my identity. Like when Arafat said we were never there in Jerusalem. We never had anything to do with the temple. My anger was not, you know, that he was nasty. You denied my memory. And if you deny my memory, you deny my dignity. This is a return to memory. Now how do we deal with this memory? Narcissistically? Triumphantly? Arrogantly? Or we say now that I have my memory, tell me about yours. It\u2019s a different ballgame. I could listen now. I have a place. I could sit down and talk with you. I have no difficulty allowing another voice into my consciousness and that\u2019s what Israel should be about. It\u2019s not about that. I don\u2019t want to lie to you. I love Israel not for what it is, but what it could be. I want that to be known. Israel is a possibility and I live with possibilities. I didn\u2019t close the final chapter. The final chapter of Jewish history is still going to be written and it\u2019s going to grow hair and it\u2019s my task as a teacher or philosopher to make it possible for more and more people to study, to understand. If you look at the seminar I\u2019m giving on the meaning of a chosen people, I want to deal with that honestly. Right. How do you understand the core of Jewish teaching or the God you want to worship? How do you understand the message that is there about pluralism? What is the Jewish contribution to a truly pluralistic world that we live in now? The contribution is that there\u2019s no idea which ends the discussion. If there\u2019s an idea that closes the discussion, that\u2019s not a fruitful thought. Dialogue is what creates possibility for more discussion. My tradition taught me, when they said Hillel and Shammai were always fighting with each other and disagreeing, and they say let\u2019s ask God who\u2019s right, is Hillel right or Shammai right? So God said, \u201CElu v\u2019elu divrei Elohim hayim.\u201D \u201CThese and these are the words of the living God.\u201D I mean, you have a multiple conversation going on in yourself. And there\u2019s an old Midrash that says when he gave the Torah to Sinai, he gave it with multiple interpretations. There\u2019s never been a single truth, a dogmatic truth, a single way of reading reality. We meet reality through the visions of other people and my tradition is filled with that. The whole Talmud is that. Right, it\u2019s a demonstration of that. Oh, God. I mean, to be a Jew is to say why are you right ? You\u2019re going to have to explain it to me. Right. Right. And I\u2019m going to argue with you. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today: my conversation with the late Israeli rabbi and philosopher David Hartman. I want to talk to you about time, your understanding of time, which I would even say palpably feels different here in Israel. What? Time. I mean, I\u2019m just saying even being present in this land, it feels different. Now you write about this. It comes up in your writing not necessarily as an isolated subject, but even when you talk about writing a new chapter of Jewish history, you experienced that as a matter of generations, that you\u2019re part of what will be a long process. Also this process of applying tradition to modern society as being the meaning of what modern society is continues to change. How do you think about the value of time, the meaning of time, in terms of religious change, spiritual evolution, within Judaism? There\u2019s the famous saying in the Mishnah: \u201CLo alecha ham\u2019lacha ligmor.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s not upon you to finish the job, nor are you free to desist from it.\u201D And know one thing: that the master is very, very demanding. \u201CHayom katzer\u201D \u2014 the day is short, but the work is great. I mean, if you went to my school, the major question was how are you using your time? Mm. What have you made of yourself in the gift that you\u2019ve received? On one level, I hate time because it\u2019s moving . I say, hold it, kid. I want to live a little longer. I want to be around. I love life. I love people. I don\u2019t know why. They\u2019re not so nice [laughs], but I have that \u2014 when I see a little kindness of somebody, I see a tear in his eye. It opens me up. I need people to take me out of a locked room and let me breath alternative pictures. Interesting, never thought of it that way. And if people could go through life feeling that there\u2019s a lot that they don\u2019t know, as James said, the whole truth has not been given to one person. It\u2019s enough to be true to the section that you have, to be true to the situation of where you are and what your existential situation enables you to see and to see a world talking that way and listening. It would be nice, no? Saying it that way, also, I think makes the task feel more manageable. Psychologically, it\u2019s a great comfort to think about it that way. Yes, I do. I wonder what comes to mind if I ask you. So you\u2019ve started a lot of initiatives here. We\u2019ve talked about some of them. You have a school. You\u2019re training girls. I mean, you\u2019re bringing women and girls into the tradition. You\u2019re doing this spiritual teaching with military officers. You\u2019re also bringing Jews and rabbis of different Jewish traditions together in a way that\u2019s unprecedented, right? So I wonder what comes to mind if I ask you how then these experiences that you create out of your sense that something has to change, how they then give you, inform your vision, you know, teach you things that you didn\u2019t expect to learn, give you new insights that are surprising? They tell me \u2014 they teach me that it\u2019s not easy. You know, sometimes you can become very glib. I don\u2019t see any dialogue in all the community. What I wanted to create was a people with discussion. On Saturday night, they get together and they say, \u201CWhat did your rabbi say about Abraham? What did your rabbi say? How did he interpret this?\u201D And they should argue what they learned, but they don\u2019t do that. They talk, \u201CDo you see the rabbi\u2019s wife, how she was dressed?\u201D So, I mean, I want a people that is learning. Where\u2019s the spirit that awakens you? Where\u2019s the spirit that wants you to search, find out? There\u2019s a passage in the Psalms , \u201CYismach lev m\u2019vakshei Hashem\u201D (\u201CJoyful are those who seek God, not those who found God.\u201D) In terms of your own spiritual evolution, how your sense of who God is has changed, what that means \u2026 What? Your sense of who God is has changed, and what that means. Are there \u2026 My God wants me to be moral. Your God. So \u2014 so I wonder if there are biblical passages or Talmudic teachings, images, that have become more important to you over time, that are important now that maybe meant nothing to you 30 years ago. What would those be? Right. Ones which are radically \u2014 radical revisions of the way you think about God. What do they mean that say God is all-powerful? His power is that he doesn\u2019t punish the wicked. He\u2019s slow to anger. What do you mean that he\u2019s awe-inspiring in the temple? But there\u2019s no temple anymore. The pagans are just dancing around in the temple. Oh, it means something else. It means if not for the awe of God, this people wouldn\u2019t have survived in history. So there was a reshaping of the meaning of the theological language to correspond to a hopeless God. Where are you, God? Where are you hiding? So they tell the Hasidic story of the two kids who were playing hide and seek and one kid hid and then he started crying. So they said, \u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D Says, \u201CNo one\u2019s looking for me.\u201D Says, \u201CNow you know how God feels.\u201D We\u2019re not looking. I don\u2019t know what God is, the being of God, but I know it\u2019s a shattering experience. It opens you to the world. It takes you out of your narcissistic ego trip and says, look, see the other. Show strength through compassion, through love, not through violence. And to be reminded each day of those achievements. It\u2019s not easy to be a religious man. I want to be religious. I want to be religious. But I can\u2019t find anyone who can make me religious, who can inspire me to feel that it\u2019s worth it. But I\u2019m still hoping. I\u2019m still hoping. On my gravestone it\u2019s going to be written: \u201CDavid Hartman who wanted to be a good Jew.\u201D He wanted to. Rabbi David Hartman died on February 10th, 2013 at the age of 81. He was President Emeritus of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, which he also founded. His books include: The God Who Hates Lies: Confronting & Rethinking Jewish Tradition. To listen again and share this show or to watch my entire conversation in Jerusalem with Rabbi David Hartman go to our website onbeing.org. And, as we prepared to put this show back on the air, we called up his daughter Tova. I miss him. Yeah. The day before he died. Mm-hmm. I sat with him and I was still arguing with him about one Talmudic passage. And literally he wasn\u2019t \u2014 and I said, \u201CAbba, do you agree that I was right about the place of Rabbi Akiva?\u201D This one rabbi in the tradition in a certain Talmudic text. And people around me were saying, \u201CTova give up already.\u201D But till the day before he died we were still \u2014 I was still trying to discuss certain things with him.
