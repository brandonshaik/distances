  "fullText": "In life, in families, we shine a light on the past to live more abundantly now. Today\u2019s show is a conversational exploration of that as a public adventure. Annette Gordon-Reed is the historian who introduced the world to Sally Hemings and the children she had with Thomas Jefferson and so realigned a primary chapter of the American story with the deeper, more complicated truth. What I would like to see people do \u2014 and I think, particularly, white people \u2014 would be to challenge one another on this question of white supremacy and racism. I mean black people can\u2019t and should not have to convince white people that we are human beings who have a right to be on the earth. The only time we\u2019ve made progress is when a critical mass of whites say, \u201CEnough of this. Whatever it is I\u2019m getting out of going along, I can\u2019t.\u201D And people have done that. I would like to see more whites do that. Painter Titus Kaphar created iconic images after Ferguson. He collapses timelines on canvas. It became very clear to me that if I wanted to know that history, I was going to have to seek it out on my own. I had to sort of manipulate what I had and work with what I had to create a narrative that I didn\u2019t see or hear. Is that when you started painting? I think people would say that\u2019s when the work got political. I say that\u2019s when the work got personal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being at the 2017 Citizen University National Conference in Seattle. I love the title for this gathering: \u201CReckoning and Repair.\u201D And right now there are questions that we are all asking. There\u2019s \u2014 how did we get here? What just happened? And most importantly \u2014 how shall we live? How do we live forward? How do we live forward together? This is reckoning we\u2019ve put off and put off and put off. And in this room of civic reflection and social courage, I want to pull back the lens to the last 20 months and the last 20 years and the last 20 decades. And I can\u2019t imagine a better, a more exquisite pair of conversation partners to do that than Annette Gordon-Reed, a citizen historian, and Titus Kaphar, who is a citizen artist. I just want to begin with starting with hearing a little bit from each of you about the roots in your life, in your formation, of your ability to see and hold complexity and history in yourself and to hold it before the rest of us. And Annette, you grew up in East Texas. And you\u2019ve said that very early in your life, as a young girl, you became fascinated with history and in particular with the paradox of this figure of Jefferson. And I wonder what in the background of your childhood encouraged that curiosity and that clarity in you. Well, I, as you said, grew up in East Texas. And I integrated the school district. I was the first black child to go to \u201Cthe white school\u201D in our school district. And I was in first grade, and I was introduced to the idea that politics mattered, that race was a thing, and that we had a history \u2014 that this came from someplace. And I, just from being in this situation where I had to crack a code, crack a social convention \u2014 gave me a sort of insight, made me start to think about how we got here. And it\u2019s interesting \u2014 in the way you talk about discovering Jefferson, for example, even then, and later on, even after you had written the book about him and Sally Hemings and that whole story \u2014 that you continued to find him, what did you say, \u201Ca magnificent and horrifying figure,\u201D I mean all at the same time. Well, yes. He was a multifaceted \u2014 as we all are, incredibly complicated \u2014 but somebody who existed at the forefront of his society. Studying him is a study of America in many, many ways, because so many of the paradoxes, so many of the dilemmas that exist in his life are in the country. So I mean he\u2019s interesting, but his connection, the way he personifies so much of the conflict that we have is even more interesting. And Titus, you collapse timelines on canvas. I want to just read some words of yours about your work. \u201CI paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, shroud, shred, stitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works that nod to hidden narratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about the nature of history.\u201D And you grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and I wonder, how do you trace \u2014 what planted this fearlessness and creativity with which you attend to history on behalf of all the rest of us? Well, I started painting really late. I had already sort of constructed my ideas about the world. I was about 27 when I made my first painting. Really? And I was taking an art history class. And in this art history class \u2014 it was one of those survey classes where you try to teach way too much in a semester, so you start with cave paintings and end with de Kooning. So in that class, when I looked at the textbook at the beginning of the semester, I looked in the book, and there were about 14 or so pages on black people and painting. Now it didn\u2019t seem like much. It wasn\u2019t much in a book that was like 400 pages. It seemed strange to me. But I remember thinking, \u201CAt least it\u2019s here.\u201D Now it included every time a black person was represented in a painting that they thought was significant. So it wasn\u2019t even just black painters. No. It was black \u2014 wow. No, it was just in general. And so I sat through that class, and I did well in the class and really enjoyed the professor in that class. But when we got to that section, the day of class when we got to that section, the professor went to the front of the classroom and said that \u201Cwe don\u2019t have time to go through this section, so we\u2019re going to skip over it.\u201D And I was the only African American in the class, and I raised my hand, and I said, \u201CI\u2019ve been really looking forward to this. And clearly the author thought it was significant, so maybe we could figure something out.\u201D And she said, \u201CTitus, I don\u2019t have time for this. We\u2019re not going to go through this.\u201D And it became very clear to me that if I wanted to know that history, I was going to have to seek it out on my own. I had to sort of manipulate what I had and work with what I had to create a narrative that I didn\u2019t see or hear. Is that when you started painting? That\u2019s \u2014 I mean I think people would say that\u2019s when the work got political. I say that\u2019s when the work got personal. Annette, you wrote this really interesting and hopeful but also reality-based article in 2008, after the election of Barack Obama. One of the things you pointed out was that for you the Obama candidacy, as you said, was a bet that the conventional wisdom about what we knew of white Americans was faulty or incomplete and that you also had that experience when you wrote this book with this revelation about our founding father \u2014 that you expected there to be huge resistance to this idea of the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and his slaves, and that\u2019s not what you encountered. So your imagination started to expand, as well, at that point. Yes. Yes. I expected resistance. I think most people \u2014 many people in the United States had believed that the story was true. The real opposition had been among historians who did not like the story, because if you have a man and suddenly give him a person that he\u2019s lived with for 38 years and four kids, that changes the narrative of his life, and that means you have to deal with it. You can\u2019t just \u2014 they can\u2019t just be side characters. They have to be part of the story. And so there was real resistance to that. And I went to Virginia, and I\u2019d give talks in Virginia, and I\u2019d be sort of \u201COh, God, what is this going to be like? I\u2019m in Richmond. I\u2019m in Fredericksburg.\u201D Or whatever. And people sometimes would come up to me with their own stories. Whites would come up to me with their own stories about their families that had been hidden, things that they didn\u2019t talk about. So Southerners knew this. Right, because, as you say, this was an American life. This was an American life, and that kind of thing happened in the South. And it\u2019s pretty clear that it did, and most Southerners understood it, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that you know but you don\u2019t talk about. Families have secrets, communities have secrets, and they whisper it, but they don\u2019t talk about it even though it\u2019s apparent in the faces of African-American people who are all different colors, different hair textures, and so forth. It\u2019s always been there. But it\u2019s always some phantom traveling salesman or phantom person who came to visit one time. It was never anybody that anyone cared about. It had to be somebody who was off and that you wouldn\u2019t have to write about. And so the reckoning was actually saying, slavery was not just about making people work for no money. Slavery created a mingled bloodline between African Americans and whites, acknowledged and unacknowledged, but that shows the complexity, the tragedy in all aspects of the institution. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with the historian Annette Gordon-Reed, together with the artist Titus Kaphar. I mean you also wrote, in that same article \u2014 and I feel like this is something that people on all sides of the political spectrum were able to celebrate and acknowledge \u2014 that that election of a black president was just this magnificent moment. It was a stunning moment. And it said something. And then \u2014 but you also said, \u201CRacism is no easy foe.\u201D I wondered if what the election of Barack Obama did \u2014 if it was not inevitable that at one and the same time this remarkable thing would happen, given our history, that also it would surface all the unfinished business in our midst for us to really meet that, to be worthy of that. And Titus, you \u2014 well, your work has covered so many subjects over the last years, but many people know the painting that you did after Ferguson. And, of course, also in these years, this phenomenon of violence towards black men and women especially, and Michael Brown and \u2014 I mean we now have this list. But it is a similar phenomenon to what you described. I mean this had been happening in our midst all along, even as we patted ourselves on the back through Democratic presidencies and Republican presidencies, with white presidents and with a black president. And it\u2019s kind of the iPhone that as much as anything else brought it to our attention. But it\u2019s also something you\u2019d lived with, and Annette, you\u2019ve lived with, right? And we weren\u2019t naming it. No, I mean in the black community, that was not a shock. That was not a surprise. Everybody knew that. I mean I\u2019ve been stopped at gunpoint by police officers when Bush was president. I was stopped at gunpoint when Obama was president. Going back to personal versus political, when Time asked me to make that painting, I wasn\u2019t making \u2014 I was already working on a painting, because I had just had an experience with my brother in New York \u2014 I was adopted when I was 15, but I still am very, very much in contact with my family. And my mother had sent my brother to stay with me for a little bit, because he was getting into trouble back in Michigan. And I was supposed to do my older-ly brother duty and talk to him about how he was getting in trouble and how he needs to stay out of trouble \u2014 it\u2019s not a good time to be dealing with police; it\u2019s prison now, it\u2019s not juvenile hall. And my brother and I didn\u2019t have a whole lot in common, at first. Started talking, day one, it was very clear to me that he was deeply interested in shoes and women, and that was it. And the extent of our conversation was very limited, as a result of that. Day two \u2014 less women, more shoes. And day three, something happened. The conversation opened up a little bit. And we started talking about things, and he started opening up a little bit. And he finally said to me, he said, \u201CHey, why don\u2019t we go see some of your artwork in New York?\u201D And I was shocked. He\u2019s never really talked about wanting to see my work or anything like that. I said, \u201CNo problem.\u201D Took him to New York. And I expected that we were going to be looking in galleries for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then we would move on and go get shoes. I thought that\u2019s what was going to happen. But we ended up going in and out of galleries for two hours. And he was just so excited about the artwork, stuff that was really conceptual and stuff that I thought, \u201CThis is too heavy for him. He\u2019s not going to like it.\u201D But he was deeply engaged by it. And so as we left those galleries, after those two hours of walking \u2014 And so what year was this? This was just a couple years ago, right? This was just a couple years ago. After we left the galleries, I said, this is my opportunity to talk to him. So we\u2019re walking down 10th Avenue between 26th and 27th Street in New York, and I\u2019m saying to him, \u201CListen, Mama\u2019s very concerned about all the things that you\u2019re getting yourself involved in.\u201D And literally, as I\u2019m having that conversation, an undercover police car speeds up to us. Police officers jump out of the car with hands on their guns and tell us to get against the wall and started demanding my ID and all this other stuff. I say that to say, everyone in my community already knew that was happening. I wasn\u2019t making that painting because I was trying to make some point. The only way that I\u2019ve found that works for me to really work through these issues is to get into the studio. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I grew up \u2014 in my hometown, it was very much known. There were many instances of people, police officers harassing individuals. One teenage boy was arrested and went into the precinct and was killed. Allegedly attacked someone and he was shot and nobody ever figured out what was going on with that. I mean I\u2019ve \u2014 it\u2019s different, even though I think African-American women still have problems, certainly. Sandra Bland, those stories everybody knows. I was on a part of our book tour with my coauthor, and we were driving along one evening, and we were stopped. And it was not anything serious that was done, other than the officer asking me for my identification \u2014 I wasn\u2019t driving. He was driving. And I was just thinking about the fact that I felt so different because he\u2019s a white man. I mean in the first place, they asked for my ID. I doubt if I had been his wife, a white woman, that he would have asked for my ID. I wasn\u2019t driving. But \u2014 and I teach criminal procedure. This is the thing that I teach my students. And it was wonderful \u2014 I got to go back the next day and say, \u201CGuess what happened to me.\u201D \u201CI got stopped. Oh, actually, my coauthor got stopped. I got stopped with him.\u201D And the notion that I would feel \u2014 if I had been with my husband, who is a black man, I would have been much more frightened, because I wouldn\u2019t have known what would have happened. I knew they weren\u2019t going to bother him. I mean he\u2019s there in his glasses and pullover sweater and a tie, and if you went to them and said, \u201CWho is that?\u201D they\u2019d say, \u201CThat\u2019s a professor.\u201D I mean it was obvious what he was, not a drug dealer. But why were they asking me for my ID, other than that we were a racially incongruous couple? And true to form, I said, well, all right, it\u2019s nighttime, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Just give him your ID. But this is the 21st century, right? You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So I \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t have to give him my ID, but I did, because I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems. That\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever been stopped, but you just think about the range of how race implicates, intrudes on every single thing that happens. The thing that I don\u2019t think that we think enough about \u2014 I mean because the stop, obviously, is disheartening, is demoralizing. We all get that. What I don\u2019t know that people understand is that when that\u2019s happening, you feel less like a citizen. You feel like this country is not yours and that your rights are subject to somebody else\u2019s whims. That\u2019s the part that I think that we need to understand here, today \u2014 that when you make these sort of arbitrary stops, you are pulling folks outside of the conversation of our political structure more and more, and ultimately, they go, \u201CI don\u2019t want to be a part of your thing, because it clearly has nothing to do with me.\u201D That\u2019s not what we want to do. That\u2019s not what we want to do. And if that was the only bad thing that came out of that, that would be enough for us to just stop that practice. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean no one was killed that evening, but as I said, it made me think about my relationship, as a woman married to a black man, feeling different. Who knows what would have happened. And I have a son who I\u2019ve raised in New York, and I have those feelings too. What happens? What happens when people talk to you like you\u2019re a dog, and you\u2019re talking to a young person, and you know that it\u2019s provoking? But you don\u2019t feel like a citizen. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been grappling with since Jefferson\u2019s time: Are African-American people part of \u201Cthe people\u201D? Are we actually citizens here? Malcolm X said, \u201CWell, if you\u2019re a citizen, why do you have to fight for your rights? I mean the citizen either has rights or not. Why are you fighting for them?\u201D And we\u2019re always in that position. And I\u2019m curious about how you, as a historian, think about how the narrative starts to shift, right, the narratives we prioritize, and how that changes. And one of the things you\u2019ve talked about with the research you did with Jefferson and Hemings\u2019s families is that, as you said, this happened in the South. Everybody knew it. Everybody was part of it. But that was oral history, and that wasn\u2019t the same as history. It feels to me like this \u2014 as terrible and shocking it is and that it continues to go on, this specter of violence and just what you\u2019re describing, people not feeling like citizens \u2014 we\u2019re also, I think, seeing this and naming this, not perfectly, not completely, but in a new way. But it depends \u2014 we\u2019ll have to see what comes of it, because we still haven\u2019t had \u2014 in the killings, in the shootings \u2014 indictments. I mean people see it, and we\u2019re shocked by it, and it\u2019s to a point where now it\u2019s almost \u2014 there\u2019s sort of a backlash: \u201CI don\u2019t want to see anybody else get killed. I don\u2019t want to see this anymore.\u201D It\u2019s very hard to indict a police officer. I mean we understand that people are doing a job that lots of people don\u2019t want to do, and it can be a dangerous job. And part of the way that people get paid to do that is to give them discretion. And judges and law enforcement is given a great amount of discretion. But there are so many instances, you sort of wonder when people will actually \u2014 we\u2019re naming it, and we\u2019re seeing it, what is the next step to try and figure out how to deal with this problem? How to reconcile or reckon, or however we want to put it? Yeah, reckon and repair. Reckon and repair relations among \u2014 we do have police officers. We need police officers. But we also need to have some sense that African-American people \u2014 a reality that African-American people are, in fact, citizens. Titus, you named something that I think is really important, and you talked about it in the context of your painting after Ferguson, which \u2014 was that called \u201CYet Another Fight For Remembrance\u201D? But the fight to remember, when an issue disappears from the media, and that when something disappears from the media, we should not all take that as permission to forget. And you bring that into your painting. Just talk a little bit about that, how you inhabit this dynamic. My father has been in and out of prison for much of my life. My cousins are still incarcerated. One of my cousins died in prison. The community that I come from, this is not \u2014 I don\u2019t have to try to remember not to forget. It\u2019s just family. When I wrote that, I was writing that for those for whom there is that possibility because that\u2019s not where you\u2019re from. It may not be your world. But in this moment, there\u2019s been this compassion that I\u2019ve seen from folks that I didn\u2019t necessarily see it from before. And I\u2019m saying, please, let\u2019s not let that go away. We need to keep that in the discourse. So it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not something that I feel like I need to work at, but I hope that as a whole, as a country, it\u2019s something that we hold onto. There\u2019s a lot of issues that we have to deal with right now. And as we were going through the consortium this afternoon, just remembering all of the oppressed groups that are struggling with different things, it feels \u2014 sometimes it feels overwhelming, but I think it\u2019s necessary to remind ourselves until we take that all on and stop dividing them and segregating them and \u201CThis is the American Indian problem over here. And this is the African-American problem over here. And this is the immigration problem over here.\u201D They\u2019re all definitely separate issues, but what was really amazing about today was everyone coming together and saying, \u201COK, I can help with this. I can help with this. My organization does a completely different thing, but we can help in this way.\u201D I think that\u2019s when things really begin to change. It\u2019s an amazing time. I mean Du Bois said that the problem with the 20th century would be the color line, but we\u2019re still there in the 21st century, and now it\u2019s at a global scale. This is not just \u2014 the ferment that we\u2019re talking about now is not just here, it\u2019s all over the world, and so problems of work, problems of inequality, the shifting alliances, and so forth. It\u2019s a frightening time, but it\u2019s also a time that if we choose to be, it could be a hopeful time. I think also about how we \u2014 one of the people I\u2019ve interviewed is Mahzarin Banaji, who helped create the science of implicit bias at Harvard. So we did shift the color line in terms of laws, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 yet there\u2019s a color line in our head, right? That\u2019s what we\u2019re reckoning with now. And we didn\u2019t know that 50 years ago the way we know it now. You know, Titus, when I look at that painting, \u201CThe Myth of Benevolence\u201D \u2014 \u201CBeneath.\u201D \u201CBeneath the Myth of Benevolence.\u201D \u201CBeneath the Myth of Benevolence,\u201D which is \u2014 as you often do, it\u2019s one painting on top of another. And it\u2019s Thomas Jefferson, right, but then the canvas is peeling away, and you see this image of a slave woman, and it\u2019s an intimate image. And in some ways, you could almost say that\u2019s a picture of implicit bias, right, the contrast that we carry around \u2014 who we are, who we present to the world, and who we believe ourselves to be, and are, in some way; and then, also, who we are. This painting was made after a conversation with \u2014 and this is a couple of years ago. We were sitting down, we were having a conversation, and she\u2019s a schoolteacher, she was a schoolteacher for years, for 30 years. And she taught history, AP History. And I love talking about history. And as we were sitting there talking about history, we sort of moved on to Jefferson, and I said, \u201CFascinating individual. Fascinating individual.\u201D And she said, \u201CWell, what do you mean?\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, you know, the issues of slavery, but at the same time, this brilliant mind. Wow. Just complex.\u201D And she said to me, \u201CWell, there was slavery, but he was a benevolent slave owner.\u201D And I said, \u201CI\u2026 I\u2026\u201D \u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean by that.\u201D And she didn\u2019t respond to me. And so I sort of followed up, and I said, \u201CI\u2019ve never once ever heard anyone called a benevolent rapist. I\u2019ve never heard that before. I\u2019ve never heard anyone called a benevolent kidnapper. I don\u2019t know what you mean. Could you please just clarify it for me.\u201D She sat in silence for at least two or three minutes, and then that was the end of the conversation. And so I got up, and I left. I went to the studio and had to do something, and this is what came out. You can see that painting, \u201CBeneath the Myth of Benevolence,\u201D at onbeing.org. There, you can also listen again and share this conversation with Titus Kaphar and Annette Gordon-Reed. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, reckoning with history in order to repair the present. I\u2019m with historian Annette Gordon-Reed and painter Titus Kaphar in a live event at the 2017 Citizen University National Conference in Seattle. Titus, you also tell a story about reading about George Washington and discovering the agony that he felt about slavery and the questions that that raised for you and the kind of agony it raised for you. Yeah, I mean \u2014 I was saying this before. We were talking before, and I was just saying, I struggled academically in school. I was that kid that got kicked out all the time. I got kicked out of kindergarten, literally. My GPA in high school was .65. And I was that kid. I was that kid. And when something clicked in my mind, I literally felt it. Something clicked in my mind, and I was able to see the world differently. I was able to engage texts differently. I felt obligated to start reading all the histories that I had ignored when I was supposed to be paying attention in school. And so when I started making the work that I was making, I felt obligated to read more about American history. And I started at the beginning, with George Washington. And I had all of these preconceived notions, some of them were right, but some of them were wrong. What I did not expect from the reading that I had done was how much writing \u2014 in how much writing he had made it clear that this was a huge problem and that he thought that this was going to devastate the country, and yet he felt like he could do nothing about it. That was the thing that was kind of surprising to me, as I read through some different journal entries and things like that \u2014 it was clear that he knew that this was wrong. Clear he knew it was wrong. Because there\u2019s this thing that we do where we try to say, \u201CWell, it was a different time, and you can\u2019t really judge them based on our morals of today.\u201D You can say that if you want to. It was clear that they knew that there was a problem with what was happening. There was a lot of equivocation that had to go on. There was a lot of decisions that had to be \u2014 there were a lot of excuses, but \u2014 that shocked me. Yeah. Well, and that was Jefferson too, talking about some of the most eloquent statements against slavery but not being interested actually \u2014 Jefferson was interested in something else. I mean Jefferson was interested in the United States. I mean he helped start a country, and that is what he focused on. I mean we sort of know that it actually was going to work \u2014 to a point \u2014 and he didn\u2019t think, at the time \u2014 it wasn\u2019t clear that it was going to, and so he focused all of his attention on that. We look back, and we\u2019re interested in \u2014 rightly, I think \u2014 in race and slavery, but that was not his preoccupation. I mean he knew slavery was wrong, and he said that. But what he basically was obsessed about was the United States of America. I think that the question of, well, what \u2014 so \u201CGeorge, if you had done something\u2026\u201D Right? I think George Washington \u2014 I mean people castigate Jefferson, but the person who had the most moral capital, the person who could have \u2014 there were always people who hated Jefferson, so he was not a universally beloved figure. Washington, for the most part, was. If he had said something, I think he could have had the most influence, if he\u2019d spoken out. And in fact, one of Jefferson\u2019s secretaries, who, when Washington died, and Washington did free his slaves \u2014 they were supposed to be freed upon Martha\u2019s death \u2014 and this person was somewhat critical of him. He said, \u201CIf he had done something when he was alive, that\u2019s the time to have done something.\u201D I mean glad that he freed the slaves, the enslaved people who were at Mount Vernon, but a president, a person with that moral capital, if he had spoken out would have made, I think, a huge difference. Although I don\u2019t know that it would have made the Virginians give up their slaves right away. But I think it could have made a difference. So nobody in this room has the social capital that George Washington had then. And I don\u2019t actually think any individual ever again will be able to have \u2014 No, they won\u2019t. Right, we don\u2019t have these kinds of generally universally respected places where everybody is looking and seeing authority. But an implication of that \u2014 actually, this could be the dream of democracy, right, that it\u2019s back to each of us in our lives. And I wonder what each of you would want each of us to ask of ourselves. What I would like to see people do \u2014 and, I think, particularly, white people to do \u2014 would be to challenge one another on this question of white supremacy and racism. I mean black people can\u2019t and should not have to convince white people that we are human beings who have a right to be on the earth. The only time we\u2019ve made progress is when whites, a critical mass of whites say, \u201CEnough of this. Whatever it is I\u2019m getting out of going along, I can\u2019t.\u201D And people have done that. William Lloyd Garrison did it. Through the years, you\u2019ve had people who did that. I would like to see more whites do that, because it\u2019s demeaning, it\u2019s not right for people to have to make the case that we are humans. And to the extent that your family members don\u2019t seem to know that or your friends don\u2019t seem to know that, I think that\u2019s something that \u2014 that\u2019s a conversation that has to take place among whites. And it has happened; it does happen, and we have made progress. But it should happen more. I just want to piggyback on that for just a second. I think when you say, \u201CWe shouldn\u2019t have to prove that we are human,\u201D I think there\u2019s probably people out here who probably think that that\u2019s a form of hyperbole, probably think, \u201CThere\u2019s no way in the world she actually thinks that there are people who do not believe that black people are human.\u201D Let\u2019s not think about it in those direct terms for just a second. Let\u2019s think about what happens to black people. So you may say, \u201COf course black people are people. I just said \u2018people,\u2019 didn\u2019t I?\u201D But when you think about what is going on \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t even want \u2014 this is something I want to work on. I don\u2019t even want to talk about it in that frame, because it\u2019s not just black people. It\u2019s not just black people. There are so many people who are treated as though they are not humans. I mean let\u2019s forget about black people for just a minute, just a second, and talk about undocumented people in this country. Talk about not being treated like they\u2019re humans. Let\u2019s talk about indigenous people not being treated like they\u2019re \u2014 treated like they\u2019re not humans. So I just want people to know that that\u2019s not hyperbole. Forget about what people say. Let\u2019s talk about what their actions are and judge them based on those actions. And based on those actions, there are people who are still questioning that fact. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being, today with painter Titus Kaphar, together with historian Annette Gordon-Reed. I don\u2019t know if this fits, but Titus, you\u2019ve got this project, \u201CThe Vesper Project.\u201D And I\u2019m just going to raise it, and if it\u2019s a dead end, we\u2019ll \u2014 but somehow it seems to me \u2014 so this is a person, Benjamin Vesper. Is he white? That\u2019s a very good question. You don\u2019t know? I didn\u2019t say that. Yeah, no, I know. I just wondered. OK. But that he became obsessed with your painting and attacked and was destructive. But it seems to me that you hospitably engaged his psychosis. Is that fair? Would you say that? That is fair. OK. And I mean speaking of \u201Cthe other\u201D \u2014 and I mean it is a psychosis, right? This is when our brains are in primal mode, lizard mode. There\u2019s something he wrote to you. He corresponded with you, and there\u2019s something he wrote to you, talking about \u2014 he says, \u201CThen the painting I\u2019m looking at\u201D \u2014 he\u2019s talking about your painting \u2014 \u201Creaches out and takes hold of me / Like the day the Indian Ocean woke up and decided to claim several thousand souls / I realize now that it was a trap / The lure was well placed / Just around a corner so I couldn\u2019t see it coming / Maybe it called to me / I can\u2019t say for sure now / But once I was in front of it I felt so alone.\u201D Somehow I feel like that \u2014 just this exchange and then also what you did with it is a bit of model. And it\u2019s very messy. The whole thing is messy. My work has always been about narrative, about stories and conversations with people. And I really feel obligated \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but I really do feel obligated to be that guy that\u2019s willing to have conversations with people who I know don\u2019t like me. That\u2019s just my thing. I just do. And it\u2019s hard sometimes. It\u2019s really painful sometimes. It\u2019s been more \u2014 usually, it\u2019s hard; recently, it\u2019s been painful. It\u2019s been really painful. Surprised at the things I\u2019ve been hearing. But I feel like if I can figure that out a little bit \u2014 I was talking, saying this a little bit earlier \u2014 if I can figure that out, if I can sit with an individual who feels very differently about the world than I feel, and I can get to some place, get any place, that I will have touched on a piece of the solution that we\u2019re all looking for in the country. And so that\u2019s sort of my motivation for putting myself through this crucible over and over and over again. And it\u2019s the same with that. I have a friend who is always exasperated with me when I answer emails from people like that, because I have the same kind of urge to do that, to actually \u2014 and not all the time, but sometimes we actually do get to a point where the person will begin to back down and will begin to open up. And even though that\u2019s just one individual, I see that as something of a victory, in a way, rather than just totally turning off and not \u2014 I mean, some people are so nasty, I don\u2019t do that. But if I have any sense that the person is questioning \u2014 because a lot of times people write to you, or they\u2019re like that, and they\u2019re kind of lost. I mean and they\u2019re disturbed by something. And they present themselves as being very, very clear and set, but they\u2019re really not. They\u2019re really questing, in a way. Absolutely. And a conversation that you can have with them, you may not come to a total agreement, but they are in a different place. And that\u2019s kind of why I wanted to write, because I wanted to be able to reach people, and reach those kinds of people as well, not just the people who are saying, \u201COh, you\u2019re great, you\u2019re great. Everything you\u2019re doing is wonderful,\u201D but people who are questing in that way. Where do people who mean well go wrong? Let me count the ways. I mean\u2026 Look\u2026 We all mean well. There\u2019s a lot of ways to go wrong, attempting to mean well. But it\u2019s better to go wrong, attempting to mean well, than go wrong not attempting at all. So I have compassion for that, right? It happens all the time \u2014 people ask these questions, you\u2019re like, \u201CWow. OK, all right. Let\u2019s sit down. We\u2019ll have this conversation.\u201D I was sitting down, for example, with someone who believes very differently from me about welfare. And we were talking about welfare, and they were just railing on welfare and how no one in this country should have welfare, and it\u2019s a waste of money, and this and this and that. And I said, \u201CYeah, my mother was 15 when I was born. If we didn\u2019t have welfare, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here talking to you.\u201D And I realized in that moment I was the only person, the only person that this individual had ever had a conversation with who was actually on the other end of their critique. And they actually stopped and said, \u201CReally? You?\u201D And I said \u201CYeah, yeah.\u201D So I have a lot of compassion for going wrong. But let\u2019s just try. OK, you don\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019ve got too many, your list is too long? Oh, where do people go wrong? People go wrong, I think, in not \u2014 well, in my area, very often seeing people like Jefferson as a god, in a way, somebody who was superhuman \u2014 on both sides; I\u2019m not just talking about people who revile Jefferson or people who love Jefferson are not dealing with a human being, dealing with an abstraction and don\u2019t see the foibles and the frailties of a person who was human. And so I think people go wrong on both ends by not recognizing the humanity. As a historian, history is not just about writing about people that you like. It\u2019s about people who were important, who did important things, and to try to illuminate their lives in a way that makes that plain to readers: why is this person important? I mean all the different roles he played during this time period, and to see the strengths but also to see the vulnerabilities. As an African-American person, people say, \u201CWell, how can you write about this figure with any degree of sympathy?\u201D or whatever. But first place, there\u2019s the fact that he lived a very, very long time ago, so there\u2019s distance. But it\u2019s not, as I said, about your personal feelings about it. It\u2019s about the importance. This is someone who was at the center of American life, who crafted words that we consider to be our creed, American creed. And whether he failed or not, that is something that was put there that every group of people who tries to make a place for themselves in the United States, in American life, that they use it. And flaws and all, that is important. So I think not seeing the humanity, not \u2014 making the person larger than life, superhuman, or evil incarnate is not the way to go. Yeah. In general, I think. So Annette, here\u2019s something you wrote: \u201CThe chief value of having read lots and lots of biographies, and having seen multiple families in action in them is that whenever anyone insists that a particular thing could not have happened, or a given situation could not have obtained in any domestic setting, I can think of a half dozen instances where that very thing, or something akin to it, or something even more bizarre, happened in a family.\u201D And I\u2019m thinking about the American family too, right? So does this also work for good turns? Could we surprise and outdo ourselves by the way we walk through this moment we inhabit? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I do think that there will be alliances formed that you could not have imagined would be formed. And that might not have had their \u2014 felt their reasons to form. Might not have felt their reasons to do it. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s a very, very up-in-the-air moment. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s reason for exasperation, in many ways, it\u2019s a reason for uncertainty, because it\u2019s a new thing. We\u2019ve never done this. As I said, we\u2019ve never had a president like this, a person who is really not a part of a party, a part of a system, who\u2019d been through all of this. So it\u2019s new territory that we\u2019re in, and I think we can surprise ourselves. I mean it\u2019s a big country, a lot of talented people, and I think a lot of people of goodwill. It\u2019s easy to focus on the negative, but I do think it\u2019s \u2014 I think that there\u2019s a reason to be hopeful about it. And all the social fracture that we\u2019re dealing with would have been there the day after the election, whoever had won. Oh, whoever won. I mean it came \u2014 it was that whole year that brought it, and the years since. Can we surprise ourselves? Absolutely. So I went to this Creative Capital event, and at the event, I gave a talk. And after I gave the talk, I watched Cassils, Heather \u2014 transgender artist who is \u2014 if you don\u2019t know the work, you just need to look it up. Cassils came and sat with me at the table, and we started talking. And I was talking about issues of incarceration, and Cassils was talking about the number of transgender women who were killed at the beginning of that year. And we were just going back and forth and going back and forth about stuff. And we decided, \u201CYou know what, we need to work together. We need to make a project together and figure out this. This is what I\u2019m going to do. I want you to teach me through your content, and I\u2019m going to teach you through my content. And then we\u2019re going to produce an exhibition together.\u201D And Cassils is my dear, dear friend now. And it has completely opened my eyes, again, to this thing I was saying before about not dividing us up in this way but sort of bringing us together and say, \u201CLet\u2019s solve the whole problem. Let\u2019s try to solve the whole thing at once, see what we can do.\u201D This is another way that we are very strange as creatures, isn\u2019t it, that a crisis also becomes this moment of \u2014 it opens generative possibilities that weren\u2019t there before, as well. Absolutely. Well, Annette Gordon-Reed, Titus Kaphar, thank you so much. And thank you for what you do in the world.
