  "fullText": "I think one of the biggest scientific discoveries of the last 30 years is that food isn\u2019t just energy, that it\u2019s actually information that actually provides instructions in a literally minute-to-minute, bite-by-bite basis to everything that\u2019s going on in your body. A transformation of medicine is underway \u2014 a transition from a science of treating disease to a science of health. Dr. Mark Hyman is a pioneer in the new discipline of functional medicine. He\u2019s best known, perhaps, as Bill Clinton\u2019s transformative personal physician. I joined him with two other visionaries helping to align medicine with a 21st-century grasp of human wholeness. James Gordon is an expert in using mind-body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma. Penny George became a philanthropist of integrative medicine after she experienced cancer in mid life. The standard of care really looked at me as a body part, and a disease, and it was clear to me even then that I was so much more than that. And what I found was it was the experience of taking charge of my own return to well-being, more than just health. And I ended up at a place that was so much better than where I had been before I started that I thought, everybody should have access to this. We\u2019re looking to create the opportunity for people to heal themselves and to create that environment. And that\u2019s what we do, whether we\u2019re working in the middle of a war, or after a natural disaster, or with a hospital system, or with a corporation. It\u2019s all the same. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Penny Pilgrim George is the board chair of the Penny George Institute Foundation, which supports the work of the largest hospital-based integrative medicine program in the U.S., in the Allina Health System of Minneapolis. James Gordon is executive director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine and a clinical professor in the departments of psychiatry and family medicine at Georgetown Medical School. And Mark Hyman is a practicing family physician and director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. I spoke with them before a live audience full of health care practitioners at the University of Minnesota. Part of the integrity and depth of all of your work is also that you \u2014 it\u2019s grounded, actually, for each of you, also in an experience of a health crisis. So Penny had her cancer. Jim, you work with depression and you\u2019ve walked through depression as well. And Mark, you were medical director of Canyon Ranch, is that right? And three months into that \u2014 so you were already on this path, but three months into that you came down with chronic fatigue syndrome, and there\u2019s one place you said it was like having A.D.D., dementia, and depression all at the same time. Pretty much. Sounds pretty bad. And a lot of other things, yeah. No, I was super healthy. I was a yoga teacher before I was a doctor, studied nutrition in college. I really focused on wellness and I ended up living in China for a year and didn\u2019t realize it but I got mercury poisoning there from the pollution. And I literally went from riding my bike 100 miles a day and remembering 30 patients without notes and dictating charts to not being able to walk up the stairs, to not being able to remember where I was at the end of a sentence, to having a whole system breakdown where my gut broke down and my immune system broke down. I mean, everything was just off. And I went to doctor after doctor, went to top experts at Columbia and Harvard. They just searched and searched and came up completely blank. They\u2019re like, take Prozac, you\u2019re depressed, you\u2019re stressed, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that, and I\u2019m like, \u201CI\u2019m not. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201D And it was then when I realized that I sort of reached the limit of what actually we could do with the kind of thinking we have in medicine. And I was invited to hear a talk by a guy named Jeffrey Bland, who\u2019s a nutritional biochemist who worked with Linus Pauling, and he was a big thinker. He was a systems thinker. And he painted a picture of medicine that was completely different than what I learned in medical school, which was not disease-based, but based on systems thinking. And I said, either this guy\u2019s crazy or he\u2019s a genius, and I have to figure it out. So I started to just imbibe everything I could about this, and try it on myself, and try it on my patients. And I kept seeing miracles in my patients, that people are getting better from things that I never would have imagined. There\u2019s a way you\u2019ve talked about this through your own experience, you wanted to understand \u201Cthe puzzle of yourself\u2026\u201D Yeah. \u2026and understand how the body works as a network, which is\u2026 Yeah. So, basically I had\u2026 \u2026the systems \u2026 \u2026to break down how we get sick and how we get better\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and in chronic fatigue, everything goes wrong. So I literally had to understand my body from the inside out, and through the lens of functional medicine, which is really a systems view of health. It\u2019s based on dealing with the causes and not just the symptoms, dealing with the body as ecosystem, or looking at the whole organism, not just the organs. And it\u2019s as big of a paradigm shift as the Earth is not flat, Earth is not the center of the universe. It\u2019s huge. And it\u2019s basically dismantling our concepts of disease as we speak, and yet it\u2019s completely absent from most medical institutions and thinking in medical schools. I mean, just the concept of the microbiome, for example, is now\u2026 Yeah. Right. \u2026taking hold, but we don\u2019t know what to do with it. How does it make sense that your gut flora could cause depression, anxiety, autism, autoimmune disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart disease? I mean, that doesn\u2019t make sense given our way of thinking. Yeah. I mean, I first heard you speak \u2014 we were both at a conference a few years ago, we didn\u2019t meet there \u2014 and you talked about functional medicine, and that was the first time I\u2019d heard the term. And I\u2019d actually had a lot of conversations with people like Penny over the years about integrative medicine, and I thought, the fact that you have to create something called \u201Cfunctional medicine\u2026\u201D Yeah. \u2026it reveals what kind of a rut we\u2019ve been in. Yeah. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s just the evolution of medicine, right? We went from \u2014 you go with a head pain to the head doctor. You go with a stomach pain to the stomach doctor. You go with a joint pain to the joint doctor. It sort of makes sense, right? It\u2019s very crude\u2026 Sort of, yeah. \u2026it\u2019s very rudimentary and \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t actually reflect science anymore. So as we\u2019re beginning to shift out of it, we have to sort of reorganize our thinking, and it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough. Penny, do you want to say something? I think it goes a lot to some of our deepest assumptions about things. And I think when we discovered the antibiotics and the sulfa drugs in the early decades of the 1900s, it created this idea that there\u2019s a pill for every ill. And I think we\u2019re still in that mindset, and I think there are some sort of sacred cows involved in it as well \u2014 the presumption is that there is a pill, and we just have to figure out what it is, and if it isn\u2019t a pill it\u2019s an herb. Right. But if we don\u2019t get beyond substituting herbs for pills, we won\u2019t have gotten very far. Right. Right. I mean, that\u2019s the sort of the evolution, right? We go from that to alternative medicine, which is other modalities from other countries that have use and that are integrated systems, and they go, well, that\u2019s great. Why don\u2019t we bring that into conventional medicine, and we call that \u201Cintegrative medicine\u201D? But you need a different roadmap to know how to apply those tools. Those are tools. Functional medicine, I say, is the map. It\u2019s the GPS, the operating system, and it\u2019s agnostic when it comes to the tools. It could be surgery. It could be meditation. It could be exorcism or exercise. I don\u2019t know, whatever it is. And you know those patients you need something \u2026 OK, this is public radio, all right? I know. I gave a talk once at Cleveland Clinic and I said that joke, and someone complained to the C.O. that Dr. Hyman\u2019s recommending exorcism\u2026 \u2026and I\u2019m like, no. So, let\u2019s name the completely different center of this new vision, which you all work on and write about, which is, it\u2019s not focused on disease, but on health, right? That, Mark, you talk about medicine as the science of health. You say, I don\u2019t really think in terms of diseases anymore, and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026Penny, to me, that\u2019s also there when you say, \u201CWholeness, to me, meant a lot more than just whether or not the cancer cells were gone for good.\u201D I mean, it\u2019s about balance, right? We now think you have a disease or you don\u2019t. But the truth is that disease arises from an imbalance in the system. So I think of functional medicine as being like a soil farmer, as opposed to an industrial agriculturist is putting chemicals on the plant. We\u2019re actually taking care of the soil so disease can\u2019t actually occur, or it goes away as a side effect of creating health. So most of us who are doctors in this room probably never took a course in medical school called \u201CCreating Health 101.\u201D So you deal with the system. You\u2026 Right. It\u2019s very simple. \u2026get the ecosystem functioning. Yeah. You take out of the bad stuff\u2026 Flourishing. \u2026you put in the good stuff. What are the ingredients for creating a healthy human? Yeah. It\u2019s a pretty dumb, short list. It\u2019s obvious, right? The right food, the right nutrients, the right balance of hormones, light, air, water, connection, sleep, movement, love, community, meaning, purpose. Those are the ingredients for healthy humans. It\u2019s not rocket science. I think what\u2019s important also is that we\u2019re really going back to what\u2019s basic to all the great, ancient systems of healing. Now we have the modern science so that we can test more accurately for these imbalances, but understanding exactly what Mark is talking about, about the basic functions, this takes us back to Hippocratic medicine\u2026 Yeah. \u2026Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, it\u2019s all there. And I think one of the things that\u2019s crucial in this transformation, though, is the transformation in consciousness. That without that, the danger that we face is of lapsing into the same kind of mechanistic treatment, and that\u2019s the part that I\u2019m most\u2026 Yeah. \u2026interested in. And, with that change in consciousness, then it becomes possible to use all the modalities, to be open to all these ways of working with people. But even more important, you become open to seeing the incredible power that each of us has for healing, and to creating the context, whether it\u2019s a small group or a whole community, in which people can come together to heal themselves. And to me, that\u2019s the most fundamental and the most difficult shift to happen\u2026 Yeah. \u2026because it threatens a kind of \u2026 The consciousness, the shift in consciousness? The shift in consciousness is absolutely fundamental, and it\u2019s most difficult for the medical establishment, because that threatens the role of the physician. It threatens the whole way that medicine is done, which essentially is that the physician or the institution does things to or for people, which of course you need if you\u2019re hit by a truck, or you have an overwhelming infection. But for most of the problems that most of us have, it doesn\u2019t work very well. Hmm. And that\u2019s why we need to understand that, and we need that to be part of the education of all physicians, part of the education of all of our children, so that that becomes a given. Yeah. It\u2019s a huge tradition and a huge complex of structures to change, right? And what we\u2019re up against is also just the human condition, that change is unfamiliar and many of us resist it and systems resist it. Yeah. Yes. Jim\u2019s work is so critical because it answers the second piece of the question, which is \u2014 one is, how do you change biology, right? What\u2019s the science of that? And the second is, how do you change behavior? How do you get people to actually do the things that are going to be necessary for self-care and transformation and awakening? And that\u2019s really at the heart of Jim\u2019s work, and is really the power of each other. It\u2019s the power of connection, community, peer pressure in a positive way, and that\u2019s the insight that I had when I helped develop the Daniel Plan, which is this faith-based wellness program with Rick Warren, where we used his small groups in his church of 30,000 to help transform the health of that community. And they were very sick, very overweight \u2014 the average weight was 210 for men and 170 for women. That was average. And yet they were able to change their culture, change their behavior. They did it together, they supported each other. And people lost a quarter million pounds in the first year, and they had all these health transformations. We ended up writing a book called The Daniel Plan. I wanted to call it The Jewish Doctor\u2019s Guide for Christian Wellness. Yeah. They didn\u2019t go for that. But, actually, we did win the Christian Book of the Year award, which is\u2026 \u2026amazing to me that I\u2019m probably the only Jewish guy who\u2019s ever won the Christian Book of the Year award. But the power of that is not that it\u2019s faith-based, but it\u2019s really that it\u2019s the power of community, and that\u2019s the model that is being used \u2014 with Jim with great effectiveness in all sorts of environments, but really needs to be central to healthcare, and it\u2019s\u2026 Yeah. \u2026hard for people to get that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a public conversation on the transformation of medicine. I\u2019m with three visionaries on front lines of this change: functional medicine pioneer Mark Hyman, psychiatrist James Gordon, and philanthropist Penny George. You\u2019re also touching, you\u2019re all touching on something that is \u2014 it\u2019s another really obvious, common sense human piece of this, which is just the human connection, and also that on the one hand it\u2019s about individuals taking charge of their health\u2026 Yeah. \u2026but it\u2019s also about us being there for each other. Yeah. And, Penny, your father was a surgeon, and do you remember times when he \u2014 I mean, he made house calls, right? So, I feel like there are these pieces, as you said, Jim, where we\u2019re on all these frontiers technologically, and then there are also old truths that we forgot that are getting reintegrated. It seems to me that kind of human touch was baked in in another era of medicine. And also I think they understood just the power of caring, and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that. And I think \u2014 another piece I want to bring into the conversation is the importance of the idea of well-being\u2026 Yeah. \u2026because health is a piece of well-being, but there\u2019s\u2026 Yeah. \u2026more than that. And altruism, for example, the doing for others has tremendous physical benefits. If that were \u2014 we should probably prescribe that for people. Yeah. It stimulates the same receptors in the brain as sugar so \u2026 Wow. Pretty good. That\u2019s good. And I was really intrigued that the George Institute, the Penny George Institute, has this transformative nurse training, which is all about, again, deepening that first level. Well, nurses never lost the appreciation for healing. And I think giving them license to go back and do what it is they most want to do has been liberating. I think it\u2019s helped with turnover. I think it certainly helped the patients. Well, and how many of us have had an experience of being in the hospital and the people you feel healed you \u2014 the doctors treated you, I mean, not to dismiss that \u2014 but the nurses brought you back to life. I have a short story about that. When I was in the hospital, it was for a different procedure before my breast cancer, and I woke up and there was a woman standing with a mop in the doorway, and she said, \u201CI will be gone when you leave, and I just wanted to tell you I hope that you heal really well.\u201D And that stands out for me more than anything else in that entire hospital. It was like she\u2026 Wow. \u2026really embodied that caring, and I felt it in a way that I didn\u2019t feel it from the physicians or anyone else. So it doesn\u2019t have to be high on the\u2026 Yeah. \u2026medical food chain to make a difference. Penny \u2014 because, so often, nurses are pushed into bureaucratic roles, and they\u2019ve been pushed out of patient care, and they\u2019re sitting in front of computers all the time. So we\u2019re working with the largest hospital system in Indiana and creating what we hope will be the first wellness hospital, The Center for Mind-Body Medicine, with the Eskenazi. And we\u2019re training 200 of their key leaders \u2014 clinical leaders, administrative leaders, and natural leaders \u2014 the security guard everybody likes to hang out with, or the Starbucks lady who has lots of good stories that make people feel good. We\u2019re training them in mind-body medicine and nutrition, and they\u2019re going to work with all 4,000 employees and, in turn, with a couple hundred thousand patients using this model. But we see just how much \u2014 and this was a lovely hospital to begin with \u2014 but still, there\u2019s so much frustration, and we see them drink up what we have to offer like they\u2019re sponges, and losing lots of weight, and starting their department meetings with meditation, and then if things get tense and tight, everybody gets up and shakes and dances for a while\u2026 \u2026and they come back. And I think all of us, we see the importance of working with institutions and really creating a whole different atmosphere. Jim, you have some practices of self-care that you talk about and it\u2019s just like Penny, you said these things don\u2019t have to be high on the food chain. You just mentioned shaking and dancing, which I have to say makes me a little nervous. But there\u2019s also\u2026 The dancing or the shaking? \u2026soft belly breathing, which sounds like something you could do in private. Would you just talk a little bit \u2014 and again, these are simple, but you talk about them as profound, that there are all these ways that we can begin to integrate transformative practices into our very ordinary lives. Well, the world has so many beautiful traditions to help us quiet our nervous system, mobilize our imagination, break up fixed patterns in all the chronic illnesses that we\u2019re talking about. The body and mind all get shut down, and to break those patterns up and to bring in what Hippocrates would have called the vis medicatrix naturae, if he spoke Latin instead of Greek. \u201CThe healing force of nature.\u201D And if he spoke English? Yeah. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re looking to help people to create the opportunity for people to heal themselves and to create that environment. And that\u2019s what we do, whether we\u2019re working in the middle of a war, or after a natural disaster, or with a hospital system, or with a corporation. It\u2019s all the same. What\u2019s \u2014 the soft belly breathing is something you\u2019ve taught people even in war zones, so just teach us that. So let\u2019s say we\u2019re in the middle of Gaza and the civil war is going on and we happened to be there during \u2026 And you\u2019ve been there. Fatah and Hamas are fighting each other. People are being killed in the streets. Nevertheless, people are coming to our training. So what we do is we say, OK, we can\u2019t do anything about what\u2019s happening outside so sit comfortably in your chair, and if you feel comfortable and safe enough, which you may or may not, but close your eyes, which will eliminate a lot of external distraction. And allow your breathing to deepen, [deep breath] and breathe in through your nose, [deep breath] and out through your mouth, with your belly soft and relaxed. [deep breath] And just experience that, feel yourself relaxing with each exhalation, and know that when your belly is soft and relaxed, it helps to activate the vagus nerve. Vagusmeans \u201Cwandering\u201D in Latin, and this big nerve, which comes up from the abdomen, through the chest to the central nervous system in the brain, quiets the body and the mind. It\u2019s the antidote to the fight-or-flight response, the antidote to the stress response. And one branch of the vagus nerve, which is activated when you breathe slowly and deeply with your belly soft, allows us to connect more easily, more harmoniously, to other people. Activates centers in our cerebral cortex, which makes bonding easier. [deep breath] And notice how you exhale, how all the muscles in your body relax, [deep breath] and to encourage this process you can say to yourself, \u201Csoft,\u201D as you breathe in, [deep breath] and \u201Cbelly\u201D if you breathe out. OK. We\u2019ll have public radio listeners all over the country doing that. Well, that\u2019s the idea. This is \u2026 What I really love about that is the interwovenness of immediately accessible experience practice, and also it\u2019s a very sophisticated understanding of physiology, right? All of those things working together. I mean, Mark, you also talk about \u2014 and of course we talk a lot about food, and eating well, and nutrition but \u2013 you talk about using food as medicine. And you\u2019re speaking that way in terms of what we are learning, right? Yeah. I think that one of the biggest scientific discoveries of the last 30 years is that food isn\u2019t just energy, that it\u2019s actually information that actually provides instructions in a literally minute-to-minute, bite-by-bite basis to everything that\u2019s going on in your body. So, literally, you change your gene expression with every bite. You change your immune system. You change your gut flora, you change your hormones, you change all the protein functions in your body, and it literally has a direct effect on every function, either for good or the bad, depending on what you\u2019re eating. So when you realize that, then it changes your relationship to food as not just a source of energy or pleasure, but actually transformational. And we don\u2019t, in medicine, know how to use food as medicine. We use drugs, we use surgery, but we have no insight that food is connected to health in most cases. And yet it\u2019s the most powerful drug, and it works faster, better, and cheaper than any drug on the planet. I mean, I\u2019ve had people change their diets in three days, they got off 50 units of insulin. There\u2019s no drug that can do that. People have autoimmune disease, they can be pain-free in weeks simply changing their diet and that \u2014 and get off very expensive medications. So we really can shift the way we think about treating disease to be primarily food based, and I think the two big insights, really, is that food is medicine, and that the group of medicine, that the community is medicine. It\u2019s not just a delivery mechanism. And you put those two together it\u2019s like rocket fuel for transforming health. Well, and also because, on the one hand, if food is a drug, it\u2019s a drug that we consume all day long, right? I mean, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s woven into our lives. On the other hand, changing behaviors around eating \u2026 Yeah. We need so much help to do that. It\u2019s true. I mean, it\u2019s the social determinants of what we eat, what\u2019s accessible and available. It\u2019s our economic situation. It\u2019s our social community and cultural situation. It\u2019s our education. Part of this movie that was sort of shocking to me, this little episode that I\u2019m going to share with you \u2014 because even though I believe that most people want the best thing for themselves, I figure some people just know what to do but they don\u2019t do it. And that\u2019s part of this movie, Fed Up, and if you haven\u2019t seen it it\u2019s about childhood obesity and sugar and the food industry. And I went to this family in South Carolina, and easily it\u2019s one of the poorest communities, one of the worst food deserts in America. And there\u2019s a family of five \u2014 lived in a trailer, food stamps and disability, thousand bucks a month for food \u2014 and the mother was massively overweight, the father was diabetic and had renal dialysis, kidney failure. The son was practically diabetic, was 50 pounds overweight at 16, and they were desperate to the do the right thing. They wanted to \u2014 had Diet Mountain Dew because it was no-calorie, they had low-fat salad dressing which was full of sugar, they had Cheez-Its because they were baked and not fried, they had Cool Whip because it said \u201Czero trans fat\u201D on the label, which is just full of trans fats and only was able to say that because the food company used a loophole from the FDA. And they never cooked. There were two generations in that family that had no idea what to cook. They didn\u2019t have cutting boards. They didn\u2019t have knives. We made turkey chili and roasted sweet potatoes, and the kids came running from the other side of the trailer from their Xboxes. They never smelled food cooking. They ate it and they loved it, and I\u2019m like, you can do this. You can do this. And they did it. And they lost \u2014 the mother lost 100 pounds, the father lost 45, got a new kidney, the son lost 50, and he went and gained a bunch of it back working at Bojangles, but then he kind of \u2014 there\u2019s nowhere to work down there for them \u2014 then he lost it. But what it made me realize is that we actually have a solution to this problem, and a lot of it has to do with education. A lot has to do with skill sets that we don\u2019t teach people. And health doesn\u2019t happen in the doctor\u2019s office. Health happens in your kitchen, it happens in the grocery store, it happens in your community, it happens in your workplace and the school and your faith-based communities. That\u2019s where health happens. You can listen again and share this conversations with Mark Hyman, James Gordon, and Penny George through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring a transformation of medicine that many feel is underway \u2014 a transition from a science of treating disease to a science of health. I\u2019m with three visionaries who\u2019ve been ahead of this learning curve from several directions: functional medicine pioneer Mark Hyman, psychiatrist James Gordon, and philanthropist Penny George. We\u2019re with a live audience on the campus of the University of Minnesota. I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about spirituality, which has been, certainly, a suspect word in science or medicine. But it is also, certainly in medicine, inescapable, right? So let\u2019s talk a little bit about the words we can put around the integrity and the validity and the substance that this thing called spiritual life \u2014 which has as many interpretations as there are people \u2014 how this is part of this new vision, this new consciousness about illness and healing. Penny, you wrote some really beautiful things about this, that \u201Cserious illness or disability is as much a spiritual crisis as a physical one,\u201D and that healing is sometimes possible on a spiritual level, even if it is not always possible on a physical level. Right. And it has to do with what animates your life. What\u2019s the meaning and purpose? For some people, faith is a deep part of it, but it can also work against it. There was an article in Time magazine, I think, and it was called \u201CA Week in the Life of a Hospital.\u201D I don\u2019t know if any of you remember it. And the very last page of it, there was an article about the chaplain, and I finished reading that and I thought, let this person never enter my room. And both my grandfathers are ministers, so I\u2019m not anti-religion, but it was something about that that felt coercive. So \u2026 When you think about, though, historically the doctors were shamans. They were medicine men. The monk bodhisattva doctor. Yeah. This is actually what tradition we came out of, was spiritual healing, because that\u2019s pretty much all we had. Yeah. And now when you think about what happens in that space with a doctor and a patient, or a healer and a patient, it\u2019s a very sacred moment. It is. I mean, I was going to say I feel like doctors are godlike figures. And there is a sacred trust, and we trust what doctors tell us, whether we should or not because they have this \u2026 Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s that aspect of it, but from my point of view as a physician, when I\u2019m in a room with someone, and they open their heart, and open their soul, and tell their story, that\u2019s a sacred moment. That doesn\u2019t happen in real life, right? We are privileged to be able to be in that sacred space with someone, where you can say anything and talk about anything, and be in that little window where magic happens. And doctors don\u2019t talk about it, they don\u2019t think about it, but if they let themselves feel that, it\u2019s powerful. I mean, there\u2019s a woman at Cleveland Clinic that\u2019s called the Chief Experience Officer, and I said, you need to change your title, call yourself the Chief Compassion Officer because that\u2019s really\u2026 Yeah, right. \u2026what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about, how do you get in those relationships that matter, and how do you cultivate that in medical students and healthcare institutions? Because that\u2019s where healing happens. What I would say, and what I do say, people will come to our trainings, and they\u2019ll say, \u201CWhen are you going to talk about spirituality?\u201D I say, well, we\u2019re going to talk about it a little later, but the most important thing is how we treat each other. That\u2019s the way\u2026 Right. \u2026we manifest the spirit and the way \u2014 whether we\u2019re teaching, or we\u2019re physicians with patients, or we\u2019re just with other human beings anywhere. So that\u2019s the number one thought. Number two is that the work of healing is the work of transformation at its base, where you\u2019re not just treating symptoms. It is all about spiritual transformation, and that\u2019s, potentially, what comes to people. Another important aspect is that when \u2014 what I have seen, whether the illnesses manifest in a physical way or a psychological way, that the sense of meaning and purpose and connection to something beyond ourselves is critical to healing, almost always, and even in the most dire situations. And that can have many, many interpretations in any individual life. Exactly. Yeah. And we just finished wonderful work at Pine Ridge Reservation. And we were working where 20 kids have killed themselves in the last nine months, and every day, one or two kids is going to the E.R. with an attempted suicide. And we saw how our work \u2014 and this is something that\u2019s been so deeply instructive to me \u2014 how our work could come together, and we could work \u2014 the elders would do traditional ceremonies, and we would be teaching mind-body techniques, and there was a kind of dance between us, and it worked so beautifully. So the other aspect of spirituality and healing is being able to go to other places \u2014\u00A0whether we\u2019re working with a Muslim or a Christian or Jewish or Vodou healers, as we work with in Haiti \u2014 but learning from and bringing those spiritual traditions together, and having a little bit of humility about our own, and being students of theirs, and they doing likewise. So I think this work is all spiritual work that we\u2019re doing. I think what can be off-putting or concerning when people are outside this sphere, when they hear that it kind of sounds like dabbling, you know? It can sound superficial. And also a lot of it is unfamiliar. So what you\u2019re talking about is honoring all the places so many people come from and are planted in, right? Exactly. Yeah. The experience is so deep. As Mark said, it\u2019s a sacred experience. So we just happen to be people working in a number of different cultures, and they\u2019re our teachers. I think it goes as deeply as each human being is willing to let it go. And love doesn\u2019t \u2014 is not an ideological thing, but it\u2019s the core of all religions, right? That\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. What is? Sorry? Love. Love, yeah. And I think, the other thing is people are afraid. They\u2019re afraid of the spiritual dimension. They\u2019re also just afraid of looking at themselves. And that\u2019s why all of our work is more challenging than perhaps it should look like it should be. So it\u2019s easy to dismiss it, to say, \u201COh, we don\u2019t have the randomized control trial, or seven of them.\u201D If you have one or two\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that\u2019s not enough. Or people will come and they\u2019ll say, \u201CWell, I want to learn the techniques, but I really don\u2019t want to work on myself.\u201D So this is the process of education. This is part of everybody\u2019s experience. Yeah. And I think what you just said \u2014 spiritual life is that place where we work on ourselves. Yes. To demystify it. And that\u2019s the challenge. That\u2019s what makes people uneasy. And it\u2019s easier to have a belief in a dogma, whether the dogma is religious dogma or scientific dogma, than to actually open oneself up to, as our tradition tells us, to looking for the truth. OK. So let\u2019s bring you into this. Hi, there. I was just wondering \u2014 I would love to see in my lifetime a functional medicine approach to eating disorders. I struggled with an eating disorder for about 21 years, and once I addressed my nutrition and my microbiome, within a week and a half I went \u2014 I worked out four to six hours a day, every day, a compulsion to exercise \u2014 within a within a week and a half of changing my diet that compulsion was gone and it never came back. Yeah. And so I\u2019ve gone back to clinics. I\u2019ve talked to doctors and nutritionists, and saying, we really need to address this. I mean, what I ate in hospitals was mostly sugar, trans fats\u2026 Yeah. \u2026just poor quality food, and then heavily medicated. So I\u2019ve got this intense passion for nutrition, but my dream is to see a functional medicine approach to eating disorders. And the clinics are growing. I mean, when I started out there were few people, and then when I would go back I\u2019d see the same people in treatment over and over, and then younger and older, and both men and women. But I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had much experience with that. I\u2019ve treated many, many patients over the years with functional medicine and eating disorders. And, often, the problem with mental illness is that we often attribute meaning to it that is the wrong meaning. There\u2019s a wonderful book called Madness in Civilization which talks about the different views of madness over the centuries, whether it\u2019s a spiritual, divine thing, or whether it\u2019s \u2014 now it\u2019s a biochemical imbalance, and the truth is that we attach all this meaning to mental illness when it actually may be something else, right? Sometimes it is a spiritual illness, or a psychological problem, but often it\u2019s a physical problem that manifests in the brain because everything is connected. So when you change your diet, and you change your gut, you see transformations. I\u2019m working now with building a prostate \u2014 functional medicine program for prostate cancer, for brain health, for women\u2019s health, for pediatrics, cardiac care, endocrine care, autoimmune disease, we\u2019re just sort of spiraling out throughout the institution. It\u2019s not sort of an add-on on the side. It\u2019s really central to what we\u2019re doing there. Thank you all. I feel like I was fortunate 12 years ago, when I was in school, to see a Sun Simiao quote, and he\u2019s a founding father of Chinese medicine, and it said, \u201CA superior physician doesn\u2019t just treat disease, but teaches society and helps form the intentions of humanity.\u201D And so I use that as a benchmark. And at first, it was more about teaching skills, like how to breathe, and how to eat, but the longer I do it, the more I realize it\u2019s really about the intention. And so I was wondering if each one of you could say what one of your biggest hopes for changing the intentions of the people that you work with and for us as practitioners would be. My core intention is to be there with another human being. So that\u2019s why meditation is central. You practice Chinese medicine? Chinese medicine, anciently, and perhaps still in the best schools, meditation is central. Some kind of meditation, moving meditation, qigong, tai chi, sitting meditation \u2014 and everything is done in a meditative way. So my intention is to be present with myself, and present with the other person, and then use whatever the tools are that I have at my disposal. I practice Chinese medicine. I use those tools. I know Western medicine. I use those tools. I\u2019m a psychiatrist. But in that presence, it comes to me, and I would hope it comes to you, and all of you who practice, what to do. And the human being is changing every moment. So we need to be with that human being and respond. And that\u2019s really my only intention. And even very early on, I want to give that person the tools to heal herself. So that\u2019s my intention as I come to people. I went to a conference and it was a strategic planning conference for NCCAM, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and there was a reception before, and there was a physician from a large health system in Minnesota, very well-regarded, and he was saying, \u201CI\u2019m really excited about finding the dose response for massage.\u201D And I thought to myself\u2026 It\u2019s a lot. For me, it\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s a lot. \u2026this is crazy, because\u2026 It\u2019s a very high dose. \u2026I\u2019d rather have 15 minutes with somebody that I know cares than an hour and a half with somebody who doesn\u2019t. And that is about intention, and you can feel it. You can feel that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a public conversation on transforming medicine with functional medicine pioneer Mark Hyman, psychiatrist James Gordon, and philanthropist Penny George. We\u2019re taking questions from the audience, comprised largely of health care professionals and students. There\u2019s one up here. Well, I thought you had a beautiful discussion on spirituality and what\u2019s the role of spirituality in healing. In the past two weeks I\u2019ve been with two friends who are in two of the leading medical centers in the world, both near death, and they could recover. If they do, they\u2019ll have long-term chronic diseases. And the question they\u2019re asking, what\u2019s the purpose for my living? What is the role of having that essential purpose for living as you see it? Yeah, it\u2019s essential. One of the ingredients for health is purpose and meaning, and life doesn\u2019t make sense without it. It just reminded me of a story of this woman who I saw, and she had crippling rheumatoid arthritis, and I knew if she changed her diet and got healthy, she could fix it. And she was in her mid 50s, or late 50s, and she had these two young kids who were from her daughter or son who was a drug addict, and she got the kids. And they\u2019re five, and they\u2019re cute, and they\u2019re amazing, and she told me all about them, but she was really not doing very well, and she really wasn\u2019t listening to me. And I, literally, I walked out of the room and as I was walking out of the room I turned around and I said, \u201CDon\u2019t eff it up. You\u2019ve got these kids, don\u2019t eff it up.\u201D And she came back yesterday, and I saw her in clinic, and she was completely transformed. She did everything. Her arthritis was all better, and it was because I connected to what mattered to her. What mattered to her was being able to parent those little kids and be there for them. And every patient has that little thing, and that\u2019s part of the spiritual surgery that you have to do to find out what is that for that person, and find out that meaning. There was a book by Jean Shinoda Bolen called Close to the Bone: Life Threatening Illness and the Search for Meaning that I found just enormously helpful. But that was \u2014 probably goes back to early childhood things. And I think that is also triggered a lot when you have a life-threatening illness, is these \u2014 what are your deepest assumptions about life? And that\u2019s another reason why it\u2019s important to hear the story. And it doesn\u2019t have to be, and probably shouldn\u2019t, sometimes, be the physician, and that\u2019s why team-centered care like this \u2014 because everybody\u2019s got different preferences. And I might find somebody appealing to me to hear my story and it doesn\u2019t have to be a long-term kind of relationship to hear their story. But getting at that \u2026 Well, that\u2019s why the circles and the groups \u2014 because you don\u2019t have to be anything. You can just be another human and that\u2019s the beauty of it. You don\u2019t need some great figure to hold that space for you. Yeah. Rachel Remen, who you first introduced me to all those years ago \u2014 every disease, no cancer and no heart disease, no diabetes is the same because, it all has a story attached, and you\u2019re connecting \u2014 the purpose is in the story, the thing that\u2019s going to keep people living. I would say that another, somewhat different way to look at it is, first of all, if we\u2019re talking about what we can do as physicians, as helpers to other people, it\u2019s to be, in our own way, wanting to be, and hopefully being, connected with something beyond ourselves that is also within. That\u2019s how we communicate it to others, by our being. One of our faculty in Gaza said to me, there\u2019s a saying in the Qur\u2019an that when you do not have hope, you have to find it in the face of another. And he said to me, we found it in your face, my face, and face of your team. And now we are able to bring it to the people of Gaza. Let\u2019s take one more. Dr. Hyman, you prove to be pretty clear about what the nutrition formula is for a certain state or \u2014 there seems to be a science in the way this is done. How established is the science and how consistently accepted is it amongst your colleagues, in the medical community? And, if not, why not? I mean, the evidence for how food affects biology is very well established. And most physicians don\u2019t understand that food actually can play a role in the therapeutic process. They don\u2019t understand how it works. They don\u2019t understand why, they don\u2019t know anything about it. And so it\u2019s sort of this big vacuum in healthcare right now. So I think it\u2019s starting to shift, but it\u2019s really tough to sort of bridge that gap, and I think, unless doctors actually see this in a real way for diseases that are proven, it\u2019s tough. We\u2019re working at Cleveland Clinic, and we\u2019re trying to show how we can get people off of insulin. That\u2019s our study. We want to get people off insulin which, in conventional endocrinology, it\u2019s a one-way street. You start on diabetes medications, it just progresses, you get on insulin and you manage your sugars, you manage diabetes. And I\u2019m like, no, you can get rid of it. And we do, and quickly. And there\u2019s evidence that that\u2019s true, but they\u2019re concerned about even being part of the study because they think it\u2019s a waste of time, because they know it\u2019s not going to work. And I\u2019m like, wow, that\u2019s really not very scientific. There are challenges to getting it pushed through, but I think it\u2019ll happen. There was an article, I think it was in the Annals of Internal Medicinemaybe 15, 20 years ago, and it sort of raised the question, why don\u2019t doctors know more about nutrition? And the fundamental reason is that information about nutrition is not included in medical education, and it goes out to people around the doctors and not through them. So doctors don\u2019t control that information. It\u2019s not their field of expertise, and so many of them have just totally ignored nutrition. So that\u2019s the other element. Yeah. I mean, most of the disease we have is caused by food, can be cured by food, and doctors know nothing about food\u2026 \u2026and it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s stunning to me. And didn\u2019t Hippocrates say \u201CLet your food be your medicine?\u201D Wasn\u2019t that Hippocrates? Yeah. So we\u2019re talking about a shift in consciousness, and an evolutionary shift, and the issues and the clusters of issues are correspondingly complex. But I just want to close, and I\u2019m not actually sure how to form this question. But just to say, as much as we\u2019re talking about health and healing as the point of medicine, there\u2019s also an aspect of this realization that illness is not only inevitable, but that illness also is a gift, right? That illness somehow is part of life\u2019s wholeness, and life\u2019s trajectory, and that it is transformative. And, Mark, you\u2019ve said illness tells us things, right? Illness is our teacher. And, Penny, your whole life\u2019s course was changed by illness. And, Jim, you\u2019ve talked about illness as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation. So it seems to me that this is also a truth to name as part of this shift in consciousness. As you say, in traditional medicine \u2014 death was failure. It was defeat, and illness was a problem. So, again, I don\u2019t know what the question is, but I wonder if you would reflect a little bit on that as part of this transformation, and also, again, if there\u2019s anything else you want to say based on what arose here. So, I don\u2019t know, Jim, would you like to start? I\u2019m speechless. No, I mean, you said it so beautifully. We were just \u2014 in working with the Lakota elders, they understand exactly what we\u2019re saying here. They say, in order to heal others \u2014 and this is a deep aspect of shamanic healing all over the world \u2014 you have to have been through the fire yourself. Otherwise, you cannot know what it\u2019s like. You cannot know how to help others with the respect and the deep personal knowledge that\u2019s necessary for that. I think it\u2019s really so important going forward. This is not our enemy. Illness is not our enemy. Death is not our enemy. This is part of life, and all of life is our great teacher, if we\u2019re open to it. And the more we are open to it, the more we can be open to helping other people also open themselves. I would just add to that the idea of, what is the invitation in this illness? Which \u2014 you have to be careful, because it\u2019s not to imply, what did you do to cause your illness? But I think there is an invitation in any illness, and part of it is recognizing that life is short. This is not a dress rehearsal. And what is it for you? And, for me, it led to this. I didn\u2019t intend this. This was not a logical conscious thing, but it was like \u2014 it unfolded as I sort of became the agent of my own health. And I would wish that for everyone who has any kind of illness, even if it\u2019s not life-threatening, is to see what the invitation is to a fuller life, and greater well-being. Yeah, I echo what Jim and Penny said but what sort of came up in my feeling, my body, was the sense that a lot of illness today \u2014 and illness has changed over the millennia, but a lot of illness today is the result of social, political, and economic drivers that are so unnecessary and so solvable. We can\u2019t end climate change tomorrow, but we could end chronic illness, most of chronic illness. We know how to do it. It\u2019s not difficult. And yet we don\u2019t address the problems in that way. We\u2019re dealing with the downstream effects instead of the causes. And it\u2019s the thing that really keeps me up at night \u2014 is how do we, as a society, begin to grapple with that? And the only way I can come up with is really to sort of \u2014 to begin to create these healing circles, these talking circles, these small groups, the things that Jim does where we rebuild community, and connection, and meaning, and love in communities where people can begin to transform and own their lives and own their communities, and transform the food system, and transform their behaviors, and transform the schools. It has to happen, but it can happen not in a big kind of global way. It has to happen very locally, essentially as local as your own kitchen, as local as your \u2014 if you own a company, if you have a workplace, if you\u2019re a part of a school, it can be a very small space that it starts in but, really, it ripples out and it\u2019s really transformational. And everybody in this room has that capacity to create that change in their own life, in their own body, and in their community, and that\u2019s where it really has to start. Mark Hyman is director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine and founder and medical director of The UltraWellness Center. James Gordon is the founder and executive director of The Center for Mind-Body Medicine and he\u2019s a Clinical Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at Georgetown Medical School. And Penny George is board chair of the Penny George Institute Foundation, and co-founder of the Penny George Institute for Health and Healing at Allina Health in Minneapolis.
