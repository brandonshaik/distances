  "fullText": "One of the definitions of randomness is something that\u2019s irreducibly infinite. There\u2019s no way to bring it down to a finite description. And if I look at that as being part of the nature of God, then suddenly this opens up a whole world of mystery and wonder. And it says that the world is never going to be, uh, we\u2019re never going to find a theory of everything. It\u2019s never going to be completely explicable. You know, we may be modified monkeys, but at a certain level, we\u2019re modified angels, too. I mean, I think even God would agree with this at this point. God\u2019s existence isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s what we do with what we\u2019ve got that counts. We tend to frame our cultural conversation about science and religion as a debate \u2014 two either/or ways of describing reality. And it\u2019s true that in recent decades there was a re-emergence of religious voices hostile to science, followed by a \u201Cnew atheist\u201D response hostile to religion. But in the years that have followed, I have been tracing a quieter evolution \u2014 below the radar and behind the scenes \u2014 of science and religion in interplay. Not a matter of competing answers, but of complementary questions \u2014 in conversation \u2014 with room for humanity, nuance, and humor. That\u2019s the territory we step onto today, with mathematician Jim Bradley and philosopher Michael Ruse. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Michael Ruse is a philosopher of science. He has delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures on a Darwinian understanding of ethics. He testified in McLean v. Arkansas in 1981, that creation science should not be allowed in public science classes. But he\u2019s also written widely on the rationality of science and religion in a constructive partnership. Jim Bradley is a mathematician, with a specialty in game theory, and an emeritus professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He\u2019s currently helping lead a multi-year project to reconcile the scientific observation of randomness in the universe with the religious observation of God\u2019s action in the world. We brought the two of them together in Minneapolis with an audience at On Being on Loring Park. I am just thrilled that you are all here, each and every one of you. So, I want to start, um, by asking each of you the same question \u2014 I think I\u2019ll start with Jim \u2014 just to say a little bit about, if you can think back to the earliest roots of your reflection on science and religion together, and if that was shaped by the religious background of your childhood. I was brought up Roman Catholic. Oh, okay. Relatively nominally, though. I mean, I took it very seriously as a child, but, uh, um, my family was not particularly religious. Um, my awakening religious experience actually was an adult, um, and it was much more of an experiential thing than a reflective scientific thing. Were you already a mathematician? Well, I graduated with a mathematics degree as an undergraduate. Then I spent two years in the Peace Corps. Okay. In India. So it was while I was teaching in India that, uh, um, kind of the religious dimension of my life blossomed, if you like. So for me, for many years, um, I really just totally compartmentalized these. You know, I did my scientific work over here, and my, uh, religious work over here, and the twain didn\u2019t really meet. So it was only when I got to be, what, uh, kind of into my 50\u2019s that I began to try to integrate these things. Really? Yeah. Um, and Michael, is that right that you were raised Quaker? Yes. Um, as you can obviously tell from my accent, I wasn\u2019t born on this side of \u2014 of the Atlantic, although looking around the audience, I think I\u2019ve lived over here longer than most of you have. Um, yeah. You laugh. You get to my age, it\u2019s not so funny. No, I was born in England. Uh, and, uh, my parents \u2014 my father was a conscientious objector. They joined the Religious Society of Friends, as they were called, after the war. And one of the things, Quakers were always very big on science. I think this is a historical thing, as much as anything. Uh, because they were dissenters or non-conformists in the 17th and 18th century, it meant that they couldn\u2019t go to Oxford or Cambridge. You had to be an Anglican or what you\u2019d call an Episcopalian. And so they couldn\u2019t become priests. They couldn\u2019t become soldiers. They couldn\u2019t, probably \u2014 most of them couldn\u2019t become lawyers. So they went into business. And, of course, business in the Industrial Revolution meant chemistry. So, I grew up very comfortably, um, with both science and religion, and it never crossed my mind or the minds of any of my teachers that there would be any conflict at all. I mean, we\u2019d heard of American Fundamentalists, but we kind of assumed that that ended in 1925 with the Scopes Trial. But I think about the age of 20 or so, I think my faith fell away. I didn\u2019t have a sort of reverse, uh, soul on the road to Damascus experience. I \u2014 I think I found that prayer didn\u2019t seem to work very much. Um, and it wasn\u2019t just that. It \u2014 it just somehow, God just didn\u2019t seem to be very much part of my life. And \u2014 I mean, on the other hand, I will be honest, I read Descartes\u2019s Meditations and halfway through the first meditation, where he\u2019s wondering about whether he\u2019s awake or asleep, I knew I was going to be a professional philosopher. And I am. I mean I do have conversion experiences. And how \u2014 and so it\u2019s really intriguing you became a philosopher of science, and a philosopher in particular biology. Well\u2026 Which I find really intriguing. Right. I \u2014 it \u2014 I \u2014 well\u2026 And that took you into\u2026 Right. \u2026evolution. So what was I going to do? I\u2019d done a lot of science. And I was looking for an ecological niche. And, uh, you know, Jim will bear this out, there\u2019d been a fair amount of philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of physics, but nobody had done any biology. And so, the chance to work on Darwin and around Darwin was manna from heaven, to use a, to use a turn. And, so, just to finish, why I\u2019m not a new atheist is that coming from Quakerism, it\u2019s very difficult to hate Christianity, if you\u2019ve been a Quaker. Uh, you may not agree with it, you may not accept it, but the loving kindness that I was shown by my parents and their co-religionists, I mean, this was a God of love. And so, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019ve always been very empathetic, uh, to Christianity and to religion. And so for me, I can\u2019t accept it, but I don\u2019t hate it. When we were thinking about doing this \u2014 because Jim is really one of the primary people out there, very overtly integrating some cutting edge science with some classic theology \u2014 and we asked him who he would like to have as a conversation partner, and you told me about some correspondence that you and Michael had been having, and so they\u2019ve corresponded, but not actually met. So, Jim, here\u2019s something you\u2019ve written, um, which I think gets at, uh, the difficulty people have, ordinary people, not trained in science. You know? So here\u2019s one way you\u2019ve said it: \u201CThe idea that, A, an infinite omniscient/omnipotent God would use a process for creating living creatures on Earth that, B, took an estimated 3.6 billion years, and was driven by a random mutation process seems incredible to many folks.\u201D But I want to ask how you, as a scientist, um, and as a Christian, uh, how you work with the theory of evolution, in your thinking. Mm-hmm. Um, well, first of all, I don\u2019t really have a big problem with the theory of evolution. I never have. No, I didn\u2019t expect that you would. I mean, I have to say that, you know, one word that comes up with scientists across the years who I\u2019ve interviewed who are also religious is that they often \u2014 because they\u2019re scientists, you know, they have an appreciation for the theory. And they\u2019ll say it\u2019s \u2014 it was an ingenious solution on God\u2019s part. Yeah. Um, I guess I speculated about this. So I think, you know, I find myself in this awkward position of being a person who trusts science, who loves it. I\u2019ve been trained in it. But also a person with fairly strong religious convictions. And, with the inability to keep doing what I was doing of keeping the two separate. So I\u2019ve got to find some way to try to integrate them. And so, I\u2019ve spent some time speculating about why would God do it that way? Part of it, I think, is that, at least the way I see God, um, He\u2019s a person who \u2014 He/She/God \u2014 delights in simply the process of things becoming. Uh, you know I think of a parent, uh, with young children, who just loves and delights watching their children discover things. That\u2019s how I see God. God has created this world, um, he\u2019s given all of his creatures their own identity, their own properties, their own capabilities, their own limitations. Um, but he\u2019s created everything with a degree of freedom, from human beings right down to the tiniest electron. And then just delights simply in watching His creation become. So I think that\u2019s one aspect of it. Mm-hmm. Um, the other is I think God has done it for us. I sometimes imagine God, uh, doing things in the way that certain type of creationists would say. You know, there\u2019s an instantaneous seven-day creation. So God would say something like rabbit, and there would be a rabbit. Uh, fox, and there would be a fox and the fox would chase off the rabbit. Um but, uh, there\u2019d be absolutely no way that we as human beings could have any understanding of how God did that, or any way for us to be able to participate, um, in \u2014 with Him, in that process of creation. Mm-hmm. And so, rather, I think what God has done is taken a much slower process that we can really understand, that we can participate in, and I think it\u2019s God\u2019s \u2014 as I understand \u2014 God\u2019s intention is to, to really make us stewards of creation, to give us the kingdom. And He wants us to be able to understand that kind of process, participate in it. And that seems to me what \u2014 is what God has done through the process of evolution. And you also sent along some of the materials you teach with, and, um, you are \u2014 I think as much as anything else exposing your students to questions they may not have asked, and really asking them to puzzle with them. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Um, you\u2019re also introducing them to a more sophisticated and, um, complex account of the history of Christianity\u2019s relationship with science, including, you know, very rich thinking on the part of St. Augustine, for example. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I love some of what you\u2019ve, um, you know, that \u2014 that Augustine said that \u201Cnumbers were already present in God\u2019s mind at the time of the beginning.\u201D That \u201CGod has given us a kind of mathematical sixth sense that serves as a starting point for thinking about mathematics.\u201D Um, but I also feel like this \u2014 this larger story of Christianity\u2019s grappling with science, which is \u2014 which has not always been what it has been in the latter decades of the 20th century and the early decade of the 21st is also knowledge that our culture has kind of lost. Yeah. Um, Augustine, of course, was kind of a unique person. Um, he was a great thinker, but he also was very much influenced by \u2014 by the Greek framework. Yeah. Uh, and so, you know, Plato had this great idea of abstract forms. Uh, we sat out in some netherworld somewhere where nobody knew where they were, and then God shaped the world in accordance with those. Well, Augustine took and put all of those things in the mind of God for eternity. And, with it, he put all of mathematics in there as well. So, you end up with what\u2019s called, in mathematics, is called Christian Platonism, um, the idea that numbers and, uh, geometric forms, and even more abstract higher-level mathematics so just, uh, are not something that are created. They\u2019re uncreated. Um, they existed from eternity in the mind of God. And, mathematicians, uh, tend to be an irreligious sort, by and large. Um, but, um, still most of them incline to the idea that when they do mathematics, they\u2019re discovering something. Something that already exists. Mm-hmm. Oh, that \u2014 that is a debate, but. It is a debate. That\u2019s right. Yeah. Yeah. Whether mathematics is invented or discovered. That\u2019s right. I think the thing I love most about talking with mathematics is this absolute, uh, connection between if something is not beautiful and elegant, it\u2019s not true. Yeah. In fact, most mathematicians \u2014 pure mathematicians, if you ask them why do you what you do? Their answer is always because it\u2019s so beautiful. Yeah. And the people who don\u2019t really like mathematics kind of scratch their head and just are totally puzzled by that kind of response. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today in our studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis with mathematician Jim Bradley and philosopher Michael Ruse. And, you know, Michael, I feel like you \u2014 you \u2014 you make a similar move with very different material in terms of opening up the history of Darwinism. Right? I mean, you\u2019ve said, uh, you know, you\u2019ve written: \u201CThe Darwinian revolution cannot be considered a single thing. It had different sides, different causes, and different effects. Often it is portrayed as a triumph of science, of religion but though there is some truth to this idea, as a total assessment of the Darwinian revolution it is far from adequate.\u201D Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m saying anything that most historians of science, certainly historians of evolutionary theory, would want to deny. Um, I don\u2019t think you have to be sort of an out-and-out cultural relativist or social constructivist, to use the trendy term, to recognize that Western science is very much a product of Western culture. And that you\u2019re going to see the tropes, the metaphors, the analogies, and the concerns, and a lot of these things reflected in the science. Um, and no more so than any science, which ultimately has implications for human beings. And so, when it comes to Darwinian evolutionary theory effect, I mean, Karl Marx writing to his friend Engels about a couple of years after the origin of species was published in 1859, said isn\u2019t it remarkable how Darwin finds British industrial society down amongst the plants and animals, you know, struggle for existence, Malthusian population, division of labor, all of these things. The answer is absolutely and completely. So, um, the way I like to put it, it\u2019s a little bit like relationships. You know, you\u2019ve got a kid who\u2019s so different from the parent and then in the half-light or whatever it is a gesture, an act, or something, you know, you say oh my God, now I see, this kid was not adopted. They really are \u2014 there really are genes at work here. We\u2019ve all had that kind of experience. I always feel the same about Darwinian Theory that even in the hands of Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne and these others, I mean, for instance, the obsession with ends with purposes. Uh, these sorts of things. I mean, these \u2014 this is right out of\u2026 Say some more. This is right out of \u2014 out of natural theology. What \u2014 whose obsession with ends and purposes? Well, the idea that, I mean, if \u2014 if you, um, if you\u2019re a physicist\u2026 Oh, you mean Darwin\u2019s\u2026 Yeah. Yeah. Darwin\u2019s obsession. The biologist. I mean, if you are a physicist, by and large, you don\u2019t say, you know, you \u2014 you discussed the nature of the sun, but you don\u2019t say what what\u2019s the sun for? You said the sun does this. But, you know, what\u2019s the moon for? I mean, the joke is, the moon is some light on the way home for drunken philosophers. Well, it\u2019s a, you know, it\u2019s a half a joke, but, you know, because moons are not in that business. But, I, you know, I\u2019m looking around at the rather handsome-looking gentleman in the front row, better dressed than I was on my wedding day. And they\u2019ve got all, I mean, they\u2019ve got, say, you know the knob in the middle of their face, nose. And I mean, it makes perfectly good sense \u2014 is \u2014 what is the function of the nose? Why do you have a nose? In a way that you don\u2019t say of the moon, what\u2019s the function of the moon? So\u2026 So, biologists\u2014 you\u2019re saying biology, um, in its nature, but also in how it was always interacting with culture and \u2014 and culture then in that time in England meant religion. I \u2014 I think so. Well, religion\u2026 Has taken up, I mean, it argues with some of the tenets of religion but it also is\u2026 Right. But, uh, not just religion. I think British religion. Yep. Um, you know the whole business of the, of the emphasis on the argument from design, and things like this. Right. I mean, the English were never heavy duty into existentialism, for instance. So, Darwin was not reacting against Kierkegaard, if you \u2014 well, to give you an example. But he was reacting against Archdeacon Paley to give \u2014 so yeah, it, it\u2026 And what was \u2014 what was Archdeacon Paley saying? Hm? What was Archdeacon Paley saying? Archdeacon Paley wrote the textbooks, uh, at the beginning of the 19th century. And his famous one is natural theology. The eye is like a telescope. Telescope have telescope makers, therefore the eye must have an eye designer, an eye maker, the great optician in the sky. Darwin himself admitted this. He swallowed this hook, line, and sinker. Now, I think towards the end of his life, he became an agnostic. But he always accepted that the eye is not just, you know, random. And of course Darwin thought that natural selection could do it, rather than using God. Although, for a long time, right through discovering evolution, Darwin thought that God acted through unbroken law. And in fact, I don\u2019t suppose Darwin, in many respects, was so very different from the kind of theological position that you probably subscribe to now. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s a story that we just don\u2019t know. Correct. There\u2019s another factor that you are alluding to here which is \u2014 is that not only is there a science and religion issue going on here, but there is also a power struggle going on, too. This is very much tied up with issues of power. Um, if you go back to the 19th century and look at the writings of people like T. H. Huxley, and, uh, Andrew Dickson White, um, these folks, um, saw so much of the formative influences in culture as coming from religion and they wanted to switch the locus of the power to shape culture to scientists. And so it became a power struggle. And you see it on the Christian side as well. There are communities that, uh, that kind of want to stay closed, and one way is to make sure that people don\u2019t talk too much to people who think differently themselves. And to create fear and suspicion and I think that\u2019s a lot of what\u2019s going on as well. So you\u2019ve got all these power dynamics outside of the science and religion\u2026 You have the human condition mixing in with\u2026 Yeah, yeah. \u2026the real issues at stake. I mean, Michael, you wrote, um, about \u2014 I think maybe this was in the Huffington Post \u2014 you\u2019d just spent a week at a field station in Kenya, uh, which was inspired by Richard Leakey of the famous, um, fossil hunting family, and, you know, you talked about the excitement of the science of human origins. Just how thrilling it is. And you also said something I wanted to ask you to draw out. Um, you said, \u201Cand this isn\u2019t just a matter of knowledge but a moral quest in a way.\u201D I think this is interesting because it also gets at the discussion that science and religion can\u2026 Yeah. Let me explain. I\u2019m sure most people know the background is that the 20th century really was the century when a huge amount of fossil evidence about human evolution was dug up. And the Leakey family, uh, who\u2019ve lived in Kenya for many, many years, was right at the front of this. So, at the one level, I had tremendous respect for \u2014 I won\u2019t say that they were doing the Lord\u2019s work, because I don\u2019t think they were. But I do think that they were doing work, if you like, and \u2014 I\u2019m a very conservative, Protestant, non-believer who takes the\u2026 \u2026who takes the parable of the talents very seriously. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re put on this earth just to have a good time. I think we\u2019re put on this earth to use what we\u2019ve got to help others, and to discover the world. And I really felt for a week there that this was really cutting-edge of people who were going there, taking students out there, because for me, as a teacher, this is tremendously important. But taking students, both black and white, Kenyan, and American, and British, and going and trying to, you know, find these grubby little bits of stone, which are just little bits of stone. You know, and putting together a story from this. I mean, you know, we may be modified monkeys, but at a certain level, we\u2019re modified angels, too. I mean, if humans can do this sort of thing, it just seems to me it\u2019s like a Mozart opera. You know, it\u2019s better than we should be in some \u2014 do you understand what I mean? I mean, I think even God would agree with this at this point. God\u2019s existence isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s what we do with what we\u2019ve got that counts. Can we \u2014 can we do it? And yeah, I really felt that this was if you like transcendent. It did not for me prove the existence of God. As I say, but at some level, I really felt that in a way, the hereafter didn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s like listening. I was at at \u201CCos\u00EC Fan Tutte\u201D last week, at the Met. And, to hear these melodies, the action, somehow that\u2019s where it\u2019s at. Nothing else really matters. You can listen again and share this conversation with Michael Ruse and Jim Bradley through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today \u2014 a civil conversation on science and religion \u2014 with philosopher of science Michael Ruse and Christian mathematician Jim Bradley. We spoke in Minneapolis at On Being on Loring Park. So one thing I believe with all of the work we\u2019ve done in trying to have civil conversations about things that are usually just pointless arguments, um, is that it doesn\u2019t actually make things simpler, right? I mean, you clear away the false framing that leads to predictable places. Mm-hmm. And then you stumble upon the real challenges, um, which again, might not need to be fights or arguments, but I mean, let me just ask the two of you, you know, what are \u2014 what are the real puzzles, um, again, not \u2014 not necessarily to fight about, but to chew on. Well, let me just lay out one. I don\u2019t know if this is the most important one, but it\u2019s one in which I know that Michael and I are somewhat in disagreement. So, let\u2019s air it. Yeah. Um, and that\u2019s the question of purpose. Purpose. Yeah. Um, is there such a thing as purpose in \u2014 in the world? Um, now you can look at the, uh, aside from the big bang, and look at the formation of galaxies, and then, uh, planets, and stars, and eventually you get water on earth and living creatures all the way up to where we are today. And you look at that whole story and say, well, if that\u2019s not clearly a purposeful direction to something that\u2019s progress I don\u2019t know what would be. So I would see it that way, as something that would point towards religion. Now, I suspect that Michael would look at exactly the same information and would interpret it very, very differently. Well, I think Michael just told a story about purpose embodied\u2026 Yeah, yeah. So, the, uh, I think that issue of interpretation is critical. Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that. I mean, I\u2019m quite happy to talk about purpose in the context of individual organisms. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I\u2019m inclined to say you can\u2019t do biology without talking about purpose. So I\u2019m happy to talk about purpose there. But you\u2019re right, Jim. I mean, ultimately, when push comes to shove, at the big question, I guess I\u2019m with, you know, Steve Weinberg. The more you do science, the less you see any point to it. I mean, not the point to doing science, but\u2026 But he\u2019s \u2014 his \u2014 he said the more we learn, the more pointless it becomes. That\u2019s \u2014 something like that. Yeah. And at a certain level, I\u2019m inclined to agree. Now, I think part of the reason is you don\u2019t set off looking for purpose. So you\u2019re not going to find something which, you know, which isn\u2019t there. Although that\u2019s never stopped philosophers, you understand. The definition of a philosopher is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black hat, which isn\u2019t really there. And the definition of a theologian is he\u2019s somebody who finds it. Okay, well\u2026 You would bring me there. He would bring me\u2026 A mathematician calculates the probability of us finding it. Yeah. Touch\u00E9, touch\u00E9. All right. So I think that points us where I wanted to go next. So we\u2019ll talk for a few more minutes and then open it up. And that is\u2026 You mean somebody else is going to talk, other than me? Yeah. Yeah. Um, so this is something I have really been chewing on in a number of conversations I\u2019ve had lately. This whole notion of randomness. Mm-hmm. Which, uh, on the surface, uh, looks like a real problem for religious people. Now, you\u2019re doing this \u2014 and the fact that, uh, you know, mathematicians and physicists\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026I think, will tell you, most of them, that the math that we have right now doesn\u2019t really leave room for human free will or certainly not for the intervention of God. Mm-hmm. Now, you, Jim, are working on this project on Randomness and Divine Providence, which really, uh, pushes the envelope. Um, so, I mean, let\u2019s just talk about that for a few minutes. Uh, so that seems to me a place where you are taking a cutting edge of science and trying very purposefully to integrate it with classic theology. Mm-hmm. Is that right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, part of the problem here is terminology. Terminology? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, because randomness has so many meanings. I mean, if you start out and you define randomness as meaning \u2014 meaninglessness, and purposelessness, then, uh, there\u2019s no problem saying that there\u2019s an inconsistency between Randomness and Divine Providence. I mean, they simply can\u2019t go together. Mm-hmm. But, that\u2019s not the way the scientists actually define, uh, randomness. If you look fairly carefully at what they actually write, for mathematicians, randomness primarily means unpredictability. For biologists, it means that there\u2019s no causal connection between the, uh, adaptive needs of an organism or species, and the mutations that occur. Um, for physicists, it sometimes mean an absence of observable causality. Uh, so these are very different meanings than purposelessness or meaninglessness. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think somewhere you said you \u2014 you think \u2014 or maybe you\u2019re asking, \u201CCan God have it both ways?\u201D Yeah. And I\u2026 Can \u2014 can God have create \u2013 and so let me, uh, let me ask you this. Is this what you mean by that? Can God have created, uh, a universe that operates on these \u2014 with these laws of physics, and that has, uh, randomness built in, and also be in charge, or\u2026? Yeah, sure. The word \u2014 the word you want is sovereign. That feels a little simplistic\u2026 That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a good Calvinist word. What is? What\u2019s a good \u2014 in charge? Sovereignty. Oh, sovereignty. That\u2019s right. And be sovereign. Yeah. Is He sovereign? And my answer is yes. See, randomness doesn\u2019t mean any old thing can happen. It means freedom within constraints, within certain boundaries. Um, I mean if I roll a die, uh, there\u2019s only one of six things can happen, doesn\u2019t mean that infinitely many things can happen. Though we know exactly those six things, and I know exactly the probability of each one. I know far more than that I don\u2019t know. And to my mind, that\u2019s the way it is with randomness. God has given an enormous amount of freedom. It\u2019s an incredible way to manage and configure the world. Um, just for instance, uh, if I \u2014 I had lunch a few minutes ago, all right. And somehow my system digests that and transports it to every cell in my body, a trillion some-odd cells, um, every one gets nourished. Little cell down in the big toe doesn\u2019t get ignored in favor of one in the brain. How does it do that? It\u2019s all done by the random transport of these nutrients through the walls of cells into different parts of our body. It\u2019s a fantastically effective way to manage things. And I can\u2019t imagine any other way to do it. So, to my mind, yes, God has created randomness, but then also, He \u2013 randomness \u2014 there are mathematical laws that govern how randomness operates. And it often configures into an incredible order at a higher level. So, God can have it both ways. Can have the randomness at the lower levels, structure at the higher levels, and sometimes those two levels are \u2014 are \u2014 get flipped, you know. And that is precisely the \u2014 the, uh, the puzzle of modern physics, right? Yeah\u2026 The order at the higher levels\u2026 \u2026and it\u2019s very subtle\u2026 \u2026and chaos at the lower levels and how to reconcile those things. Yeah. What are you thinking, Michael? But, uh, you see, I\u2019m a little bit discombobulated here, because I don\u2019t put randomness and freedom, as it were, on the same line. It seems to me that almost randomness is a, um, is almost an enemy of freedom. And of course, I \u2014 all moral education goes this way. That we can only define freedom by\u2026 Yeah, I mean, for me\u2026 \u2026by defining the boundaries. A moral education is, you teach some \u2014 a child something expecting it will have an effect in the future, if you like. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re less free, but it does mean they\u2019re less random in some sort of sense. And you say, well, you know, you should have done this because you were taught this. So, as I say, I \u2014 and I\u2019m right with Jim on these different notions of randomness. I think that that\u2019s right. And \u2014 maybe this is a good point to go out on \u2014 is that I worry about this juxtaposition. It\u2019s not saying that you\u2019re doing it, Jim, but I think is something a lot of people do do. And I think a lot of scientists do this. Oh, well, quantum physics proves free will. Quantum physics may do many things. It does not prove free will. Because as I see it, that freedom \u2014 it\u2019s freedom, not license, in a way, that freedom demands the world working properly. Otherwise, things happen randomly. So, so you\u2019re arguing for order\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m arguing\u2026 \u2026even where we see chaos. Yeah, you know, in my field, it\u2019s known as compatibilism. But, I don\u2019t hear you objecting to the words divine providence. Not that I think you\u2019re not objecting because you believe in them, but I mean, let me ask the two of you. I feel like maybe this is kind of an evolution in the science/religion struggle. That this question of does God exist, or does God not exist, doesn\u2019t seem the interesting question to be debating anymore, partly because everybody kind of agrees that it\u2019s not going to be proven one way or the other. I think that here\u2019s the point, I think, that Jim and I do disagree on. Mm-hmm. Is I think we both think that randomness is a very important phenomenon. I think that Jim thinks nevertheless, that within his Christian perspective, he can accept modern science, and at the same time, accept some of the very important beliefs that he holds, for instance, about the status of humans. I\u2019ve no reason to think you think humans are the only important organisms or anything like that. But, as a Christian, I take it you think that we\u2019re made in the image of God, and that we have a particular place in the Christian world picture. Let me put it that way. I mean, sufficient of a place that God suffered on the cross for our salvation. He didn\u2019t do that for warthogs. Uh, whereas I, as a non-believer, take randomness seriously. And although we have evolved, I have big problems in seeing that we had to evolve. In a way I\u2019ve got the nasty feeling we\u2019re doing it backwards. And so within my world picture, as long as we just consider this world of ours, then I have big problems with the notion of randomness. As to why, I think we\u2019re radically contingent in a way that I personally don\u2019t find particularly comfortable or compatible with \u2014 with the Christian story. Now, I know you would disagree with me on that. But I think that\u2019s the point. I think there is a point where you and I, respectfully, if you like, really do have very different takes on the world. I think anyone who affirms the Christian story is going to have to say that there\u2019s some degree of divine guidance or direction to that process. Um, that is not totally and utterly contingent. Right. You know, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re referring back to, uh, Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s famous, um, example about running the tape back a million years and replaying it. Yep. But\u2026 And there\u2019s so many contingent things that happen. So tell it. Tell us that. Sure. Okay. Is this that we\u2019re moving backwards, you said? Well, all right, so Gould said, let\u2019s go back a million years. Okay. Now, there\u2019s so many mutations that could happen, so many different contingent events that could happen, that each of those is like a branch on a tree. And you down one branch, and then there\u2019s another branch, there\u2019s another branch. By the time you get through millions and billions of these branches, we\u2019ve only followed one of those branches to where we are today. So, the chances of our actually following the same branch again is so infinitesimally small that we could not possibly end up at the same place. This world is so utterly and radically contingent. That\u2019s Gould\u2019s argument. Yeah. Okay. Um, and most Christians will say well, there may be some room. Perhaps it\u2019s totally front-loaded, you know, that God or somebody set up the system in such a way that things converge in a certain direction. Perhaps it was more interactive, God guiding it along the way. But nevertheless, it\u2019s not as contingent as Gould would make out. Or as I think probably, Michael, you would say. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today in our studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis with mathematician Jim Bradley and philosopher Michael Ruse. And now, um, I believe one or more of my colleagues is going to circulate \u2014 Lily. Lily Percy, our senior producer, with a microphone. And we\u2019ll have a few minutes of anything you\u2019d like to add. Uh, so my question is on the notion of harmony. You talked about purpose for a little. Uh, I\u2019d like you both to address the notion of interrelationships vis-\u00E0-vis where you\u2019re coming from, the notion that we are, I believe to be a harmonious world, and how your philosophies would support or not support that. But \u2014 but that\u2019s a complicated notion, because it\u2019s not all harmonious, right? You\u2019re saying that \u2014 what are you saying then, that ultimately\u2026 Well, I think at least coming from a Christian tradition, we are to be in relationship with one another. Mm-hmm. And that is what I get from my faith. So, um, so I\u2019d like to hear what both of you would say about relationships, about how Jim and how Michael both would feel about, uh, this notion of are we to have harmony, or is existing so much these days disharmony? Well, I may be taking this in a different direction than you want to go, but it seems like, um, if you\u2019re talking about harmony and disharmony, you can\u2019t deal with it from within the Christian framework without talking about the Christian concept of sin. And then that gives the whole question of the origins of sin. It gets into the whole question of the notion of Adam and Eve. Now we\u2019re getting into things that are really sort of traditional Biblical, uh, science problems, right. I can say that this whole virtually a cottage industry in the evangelical theological world right now, um, trying to figure out questions like the origin of sin. How did this come into the human species? Is it an evolutionary product? Is it\u2026 And can we just define sin broadly as all of those things which, uh, work against harmony? Yeah. I guess I kind of like Augustine\u2019s definition here. It\u2019s inordinate desires. Uh, having our affections disordered in some way. Other people might define it behaviorally. But yes, it\u2019s all those kinds of things. Mm-hmm. Um, so, uh, this is a huge question that is on the table right now. Um, now that doesn\u2019t answer your question, but it, you know, it points to the fact that there\u2019s a lot of disagreement about this question. I don\u2019t know, Michael, do you have thoughts on that? Yeah. Um, I really think Darwin put a bomb into this one. I think that\u2026 Darwin? Darwin did. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think that before Darwin, whether for Christian or I would go back to Greek metaphysics. Mm-hmm. That we really had some idea of balance, a balance of nature, uh, a harmony of some sort. As I say, I mean, you have to dig into the history on this one. But my understanding is that this is a pre-Christian notion and certainly one that you find very much in a lot of Greek thought. And I think that Darwin put a bomb in it in this way. He said, of course there\u2019s going to be harmony. But only if it\u2019s in our interests, as it were. And normally it is in our interests. I mean, we\u2019re much better off. My personal feeling is that thoughts of harmony are very dangerous. And say well, it\u2019s okay, folks, God will look after us. You know, if God was worried about fracking, he wouldn\u2019t have put the gasses there in the first place. So don\u2019t worry about it. If, you know, we need it, we can use it. I agree. What do you agree with? I mean\u2026 That we\u2019d find ourselves on the page with these issues, like global warming, fracking, so forth. To say that, well, you know, the world will just recover. God isn\u2019t going anything bad to happen. No. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. We have to be responsible. And these are serious issues that we have to take some responsibility for. Mm-hmm. We can\u2019t just say it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s all going to work out. Another question? Yeah. Yeah, uh, could talk, both, a little bit about how your world views affect your, uh, your ethical views. How do you each think that ethics needs to be grounded, or does it? Well, you\u2019re the philosopher, why don\u2019t you go first on this one? Well, does it make any difference about the things I think which really matter? I\u2019m inclined to think not. I\u2019m inclined to think that we all hold to a common sense morality about caring about people, those sorts of things. Sure, there are differences there, but\u2026 But I think the question is, um, where is your ethical sensibility rooted, or what\u2026 I think it\u2019s rooted in my psychology. I mean, I\u2019m a Humian. I mean, ultimately, I\u2019ve \u2014 David Hume says you can do all this philosophy you like, but it, you know, you end in skepticism, but fortunately, you know, I dine, I converse with my friends, I play a game of backgammon, uh, when I get back to my study, it all seemed cold and strained. And basically that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I personally think that, you know, psychology \u2014 I don\u2019t go through life worrying about whether the world is going to end tonight. I don\u2019t go through life thinking, okay, I\u2019m a Darwinian, it\u2019s okay for me to go out and rape and pillage, and, you know, and get away with it, because I\u2019m an evolved human being. So why would I do anything else? So, at a certain level, I know Jim would disagree with me, I think Christianity is irrelevant. You know, in fact, it\u2019s just something of a\u2026 You mean in terms of\u2026 \u2026scab on the situation? You mean in terms of having an ethical sensibility? Yeah, right. Right. I probably, you know, have certain feelings about pacifism. I\u2019m more strongly drawn to pacifism than I think a lot of my fellow Americans, or fellow whatever, but that\u2019s because of my Quaker background. I mean, there\u2019s certainly a lot of Christians who would say the Quaker attitude on pacifism, we understand it, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the Christian position. I mean, so, this is the difficulty I have. Yeah. Well, I guess speaking just for myself, I see myself as a very ordinary Christian. I mean, what I believe is, I try to emphasize what\u2019s common to Protestantism, Catholic tradition, and Orthodox Christianity. And kind of put my roots in that. But for a person who\u2019s a religious believer, um, their identity is very much tied up with their faith and with their relationship with Christ, and who they are, um, and so in this sense, it can\u2019t be irrelevant, because it becomes the very root of identity itself. Right, no absolutely. And in that sense, the ethics flow out of that sense of identity, uh, and the identity being rooted in the person of Christ. But that\u2019s so, kind of the view from 1,000 feet, or 10,000 feet perspective. I guess, I want to get back to you. I want to do something more specific, uh, that you have in the back of your mind, and as you asked that question, that you\u2019re wondering about. You want to know what was on my mind when I was asking the question? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What motivated your question? Uh, well, um, I am in the middle of pushing through Hilary Putnam\u2019s book, Ethics Without Ontology. Um, and, uh, I was just wondering from your two very educated perspectives, obviously, uh, whether you can have a really robust sense of ethics without having a metaphysical support for it, like religion. So, I think Michael says yes, and Jim, I\u2026 Well, I think it\u2019s certainly possible to do that, yes. Certainly, I think I would agree with Michael on that. It doesn\u2019t have to be my particular foundation\u2026 No, for you. But for you it\u2019s not separable. Right. It wouldn\u2019t work for me, but I think it\u2019s possible for others. Um, you\u2019ve both written, uh, in different ways about the anxiety that these questions cause, and that they\u2019ve caused across history. And Michael, I think, you know, you wrote about it, the anxiety of the Victorians and, right? And the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and how people weren\u2019t even \u2014 the, um, approaches to this aren\u2019t always rational, and that\u2019s partly because this kind of thinking and this kind of change is actually frightening. Um, so, I guess I\u2019m curious about, you know, as we \u2014 as we come to a close about how the two of you think about calming that fear and, you know, what might the framework be of, uh, a new discussion, or a new encounter with these ideas. And also, if you \u2014 if you see that happening in your spheres. Well, okay, looking from my perspective, I feel those tensions very much and that anxiety very much in myself, both as a person who loves and is committed to science, and a person with a religious commitment as well. And those two worldviews sometimes clash, and I feel the tension of that. And I think discussion helps. I think it helps to have kind of plausible accounts of things, from people who can say, yeah, I can see how these two things both make sense. And that can relieve some anxiety. I think in this case simply education and learning, uh, can go a long ways to relieve some anxieties. You know, like, I agree entirely. I want to pick up on your point, the man on the front row, about harmony, too. I honestly thought when I was 20 that I was going to get back on in the fold by the time I was 70. You know, better \u2014 better \u2014 better cover my options on this one. But I do find now I\u2019m in my 70s, in fact, I\u2019m not drawn to going back to Christianity. And this picks up on a number of the questions. And I do think it\u2019s a question of inner harmony in a sense of self-worth, a feeling, have you used your talents wisely and in a worthwhile \u2013 I mean Plato makes a lot of this in the Republic. Getting the parts of your soul, and don\u2019t forget, Plato means something broader by soul than just a Christian soul, your whole psychic being, but getting these things in a sense of harmony. And I\u2019ve found, as I get older, that that\u2019s become something tremendously important to me. And so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. And I don\u2019t know, Jim, I don\u2019t know. Maybe my God was a Presbyterian who didn\u2019t like the world. I\u2019m just a happier human being since I gave up Christianity. Now, yeah, I hate to say this. I really, truly speaking for myself, feel a sense of balance, and I\u2019m not scared. And I\u2019m not doing it because the brownie points. I\u2019m doing it because I want to do it. And somehow, for me, that\u2019s really important. So, maybe this is a big difference that we, that we have. And I\u2019m trying not to be too snarky or superior towards you. Well, Michael, in an email I sent you one time, I don\u2019t remember what the conversation, but, uh, I made the comment, I said, Michael, the problem is, you just haven\u2019t fallen in love with Jesus Christ. And, um, I wish I could have been there to see your face when you read this. I was kind of visualizing it. And I sort of read some things into your response to me, as you kind of tried to, uh, um, um, stumble over what I had just said, that you felt obviously very awkward about. Um, but, um, you know, you say you\u2019re pretty comfortable with the way it is right now, and that\u2019s fine, but I think the fact is that you just really haven\u2019t that love relationship just hasn\u2019t developed. Yeah. And that\u2019s the difference. Yeah. I just want to throw this out there, um, I often feel that, uh, that scientists have the most robust vocabulary of mystery and wonder, and that it\u2019s something that religious people could learn from. Um, and that, and that it could be, uh, a kind of a shared vocabulary, which by definition doesn\u2019t need agreement or, you know, a definition of terms. Um, that there\u2019s this shared space. And I feel like even, um, as the two of you have kind of danced around, you know, your best answers or your best thinking on some big questions, that the big questions remain, right? And they\u2019re fascinating, and they\u2019re kind of wonderful in themselves, that they\u2019re sitting between us. Um, and\u2026 Well, isn\u2019t that the whole thing about life is you come in with these wonderful questions, you work on them yourselves, and then you pass them on to your students and your children. Again, I go back to education. I don\u2019t, I mean, I see education not as giving my students answers, it\u2019s giving them the tools to, you know, to ask the new questions and to tackle the answers for themselves. So, of course, but of course, it\u2019s just a wonderful thing, I mean, the science that Jim does is always throwing up new challenges, and new things that we discover about, let\u2019s say, I mean, I don\u2019t immediately see the relevance, for instance, of the fact that we now know that we\u2019re, what, 5% Neanderthal genes, but I\u2019m sure down the road\u2026 Well, I think it\u2019s fascinating because that might be where red hair came from. I think it\u2019s really significant. But I just have to say, you know, what you just said about being born, and having questions, and passing them on, I mean this is probably provocative because we\u2019re closing rather than starting, but in a way, it\u2019s the kind of image that you gave in the beginning of how do you image the nature of God, given what we know of human reality. And given what you know of science. Like, how you could come up with a concept of God that would work with your science. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, in fact, I\u2019m going to go in the direction you just said about a minute ago about mystery and wonder. Um, you know, one of the things that\u2019s happened with me in the study of randomness, uh, is that one of the definitions of randomness is something that\u2019s irreducibly infinite. There\u2019s no way to bring it down to a finite description. And if I look at that as being part of the nature of God, then suddenly this opens up a whole world of mystery and wonder. And it says that, uh, the world is never going to be, uh, we\u2019re never going to find a theory of everything. Explicable. It\u2019s never going to be completely explicable. And I was talking about this at a conference recently, and a person in the audience said, you know, he said, I was brought up in a religious tradition that always emphasized God\u2019s covenant faithfulness. And now, you\u2019ve opened up a whole different way of looking at God to me. Um, in terms of unfathomable mystery. And I thought, wow, that\u2019s been worthwhile. I mean, if just thinking about random numbers does that really makes it all worthwhile. But Jim, isn\u2019t your position terribly sterile in the sense that\u2026 Wait. Wait. We\u2019re finishing. We\u2019re not starting up again. In the sense that you think that it\u2019s all going to come to an end, and then God\u2019s going to give you all the answers, and then you\u2019re going to spend the rest of eternity singing hymns. Is that what you think? I mean, isn\u2019t this\u2026 Is that what you think? Here\u2019s one place where we really disagree. But\u2026 No. I would say God is unfathomably infinite. Doesn\u2019t matter how much you understand and how well you understand it, there\u2019s still an infinite amount of wonder out there we haven\u2019t begun to touch yet. Okay. I think we\u2019re going to stop there. Um, I want to thank the two of you for coming all this way for this, and thanks everyone for being here at On Being on Loring Park. Yeah. We\u2019re done.
