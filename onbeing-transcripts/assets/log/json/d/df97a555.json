  "fullText": "Who knew that the architect behind St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral was also an anatomist who diagrammed the human brain? Fast-forward three centuries, and new scientists of the brain are learning why our sensory experience in a place like a cathedral \u2014 the incense, the soaring music, the stained glass, and the light \u2014 is physiologically good for us. Esther Sternberg is an immunologist and a pioneer on this new frontier that\u2019s giving rise to disciplines like neuroimmunology and environmental psychology. Architects are working with scientists to imbue the spaces we move through \u2014 the sights, sounds, and smells of them \u2014 with active healing properties. And Esther Sternberg says all of us can create surroundings and even portable sensations to manage stress and tap our brain\u2019s own internal pharmacies. What is it about beautiful vistas of mountains, about the infinite horizon of the ocean, about a cathedral? There are certainly physiological and neuroscientific bases to that feeling, and I am convinced \u2014 I know \u2014 that these things can be measured. And that\u2019s the exciting new frontier for me, to ask exactly that question. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being. I spoke with Esther Sternberg in 2012. She grew up in Canada surrounded by scientists. Her father survived a concentration camp in Russia to become a pioneer of nuclear medicine. She trained with a good deal of scientific skepticism that emotions play any role in health. But she had a radical change of mind between breakthroughs in medical research, the illness of her mother, and her own diagnosis of arthritis. Some listeners may remember my popular interview with her a few years ago about stress and the balance within. Esther Sternberg\u2019s unfolding passions are outlined in her newer book, Healing Spaces: The Science of Place and Well-Being. I wanted to just start with these words \u201Cplace\u201D and \u201Cwell-being.\u201D Where does your mind go back earliest in your life when you put those two words together, \u201Cplace\u201D and \u201Cwell-being\u201D? I\u2019m curious about that. Well, it goes back to \u2014 actually, I was very small, probably in grade one or grade two, and I was sitting at breakfast with my father outside on the terrace. And he used to read while he ate breakfast, and there was probably a mystery story propped up against his coffee mug . And he looked up from his mug \u2014 it was early spring and he looked up at me and he said, \u201CListen to the sounds of peace.\u201D And I had no idea what he meant. And all I could hear was a dog barking and the pock-pock of a tennis ball across on the \u2014 at the courts across the street and the birds chirping. And I only understood many, many years later that, for him, he was only about 10 years away from the war, from World War II. And my mother also \u2014 my mother and her siblings had escaped literally on the last moments when the trains were leaving Rumania, Germany, and, you know, eventually they got to Canada. And so we were washing the dishes, you know, after dinner, and we really couldn\u2019t see the sunset from our house, but you could tell that it was going to be a beautiful sunset. So we\u2019d all drop everything and my father would drive us to the top of the hill where the University of Montreal sits and we\u2019d sit and look at the sunset. And my parents explicitly instilled in me the knowledge that we should look, hear, smell, touch everything in our surrounding environment and savor it because this could be your last day. They actually said that to me a number of times, especially the sunset. Look at it as if it\u2019s your last. Gosh. And so you make this observation in your more recent work that physicians and nurses know that a patient\u2019s sudden interest in external things is the first sign that healing has begun. And you ask, do our surroundings in turn have an effect on us? And you\u2019re part of these new encounters between neuroscience and other kinds of scientists and architecture and people involved in all kinds of spaces, from how hospitals are designed to civic spaces to contemplative spaces. So there\u2019s a drama unfolding. There\u2019s a cast of characters and there\u2019s this whole new body of knowledge. It\u2019s really exciting. And one of the milestones in this story that you\u2019ve talked about is Roger Ulrich\u2019s study called \u201CThe View from a Window\u201D study of 1984, which was the beginning of one of these pieces of this new puzzle of what you now call environmental psychology. Right. Well, so Roger Ulrich is an environmental psychologist who took advantage of a naturalistic experiment, if you will, where in patients were admitted to a ward for gallbladder surgery. Back in those days, you actually stayed in hospital for a number of days after you had gallbladder surgery. And some of them randomly were assigned to beds with a view of a brick wall and others had a view of a grove of trees. And he simply took the clinical data and measured how much pain medication these patients needed during their recovery, how long they had to stay in hospital, in other words, how quickly they healed, the number of negative nurse\u2019s notes where they were complaining or had pain or such, and he controlled for everything: age, sex, you know, med \u2014 other medication use, other disease use. And all of these patients were taken care of by the same doctors and nurses. So it was an extraordinarily well-controlled study. And even with all these controls where the single variable that differed between patients was the view out the window, what he found was that the patients with a view of a grove of trees left hospital on average a day sooner, needed less pain medication, and had fewer negative nurse\u2019s notes than patients who had a view of a brick wall. So interesting, yeah. Well, and one of the scientists that we interviewed, Irving Biederman, has a great quote where he says, you know, obviously, looking at a view does something positive to the brain. And his hypothesis is that endorphins are released in that part of the brain that recognizes a beautiful or preferred view. And he said, why else would we pay hundreds of dollars more for a hotel room with a beautiful view? Right. You know, that really tells you that people are willing to put money out to pay for a view. Yeah, but we don\u2019t think of it in terms of this is good for us. We don\u2019t even think it that through that much. We just know that\u2019s what we want. So let\u2019s talk about some different kinds of experiences that, again, we have and maybe things we kind of know without processing. I mean, so I think most people or certainly many people would agree that being in a place of beautiful nature is somehow nourishing, uplifting. You know, people would use different words. That it feels good and is good for us and we often know that we\u2019re restored afterwards. So what do you know \u2014 what do we know now about what is happening in us physiologically in those experiences? I \u2014 I want \u2014 Because you used the word \u201Crestore,\u201D can I read something, a favorite psalm of my father\u2019s? Yes, of course. So my father was not a very religious man, but he would read his favorite psalm, which was the 23rd, sometimes after dinner. He\u2019d pull the Bible off the shelf and he\u2019d read it with both wisdom and calm. And it starts: \u201CThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters; He restoreth my soul. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\u201D I think that psalm \u2014 and I didn\u2019t realize it until I got to the last chapter of the book and I put that in there because my father used to read it. I didn\u2019t realize that that really comes to the core of what I\u2019m talking about there. Yeah. I actually read that in your book as well and was so struck by it. I mean, that\u2019s the 23rd Psalm. You\u2019re father was Jewish. For Jews and Christians, it\u2019s incredibly meaningful. I remember working on a floor with patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and so many people there who had lost everything, every memory, could still recite the 23rd Psalm. But I also had never considered how much that it\u2019s visual. It\u2019s a picture of place, right? It\u2019s the still \u2026 Right. Still waters, the green pastures, and how that works things in us. Right, and it does take you there. So those environmental variables are really important. They\u2019re affecting the brain\u2019s stress response and the brain\u2019s relaxation response. Another really basic thing that your work makes me be conscious of is light and color. Again, maybe we know this, but when you talk about or you describe the places where I think many of us have memories of being invigorated by these things, of being most aware of them, would be gardens or, on the other end of that, stained-glass windows, that somehow captures some of that same, you know, almost not just the restorative, but the energetic properties of those things. Well, I think that\u2019s the very interesting point because, in general, we don\u2019t want to be always in a soporific state, right? You want to be that way when you\u2019re relaxed, when you\u2019re at the beach, when you\u2019re going to sleep. But equally, you want to be energized, you want to be happy, you want to have some sense of desire, you want to be alive. Being alive means that you respond moment to moment to different external stimuli in an appropriate way, and people want to feel alive. I mean, I think that\u2019s why they go to places like theme parks, like Disneyland, Disney World. You know, you get on a ride and you really feel that zing, which comes from controlled stress response really, which when it\u2019s just a little bit in the right circumstances, is actually energizing. People in theater, people in movies figured all this stuff out a long time ago. A long time ago, before doctors did, yes, yes. A long time ago, by trial and error. You know, what\u2019s the first thing that happens when you go into a movie theater or a theater? What\u2019s the first thing that happens? Well, it\u2019s dark. I mean, it\u2019s a whole enveloping experience. Yes, that\u2019s it. Well, the lights go out. Yeah. What that does is it takes away your own reality and it allows the producer to replace your reality with their reality because they\u2019ve taken away the visual cues. So now you can immerse yourself in another place, in an imaginary place, and you forget about your surroundings. One of the really interesting pieces of history that you tell is that Christopher Wren, who is the architect who designed St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, that he started out \u2014 did he start out as an anatomist and he was doing illustrations for an anatomist? Yeah. I was speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine in London and this august society has been around for, I don\u2019t know, several hundred years. I learned this interesting piece of information when I actually went to their library, and you can look at the original drawings of Sir Thomas Willis, the anatomist who first described the brain in perfect detail. He has this huge tome from 1664 where he \u2014 every page shows engravings of the brain in perfect detail. We cannot do better today. There\u2019s cross-sections and elevations and three-dimensional and two-dimensional and every possible visual rendering of the brain. And at the very beginning of this, you know, 400-year-old book, there is a dedication to Christopher Wren \u2014 my colleague, Christopher Wren \u2014 who is the one who actually drew those drawings. You know, who better than an architect to draw the drawings of the brain? So there was this collaboration across disciplines, which today we are carrying on in a different iteration. So one of the big interesting places this points out is at what we have traditionally called \u201Cthe placebo effect.\u201D And there\u2019s been a lot of interesting thinking and revisiting of that term recently, and your work is, you know, very much speaking to that. How would you describe what you\u2019re learning what you know that, I don\u2019t know, would not only make us rethink, but perhaps rename this thing we call the placebo effect? Well, the placebo effect really is the brain\u2019s own healing process, and that\u2019s a long word, so it\u2019s probably easier to say the placebo effect. But the problem with the word placebo is it carries with it a lot of baggage. Yeah. It feels like a trick or there\u2019s nothing to it somehow. Right. The word placebo is usually preceded by a four-letter word: \u201Cjust.\u201D Right. Oh, it\u2019s just the placebo effect. Well, you know, when you look, there\u2019s controversy about this too, the exact numbers, but when you look at placebo-controlled trials, the reason we have to do placebo-controlled trials to determine the \u201Ctrue biological effect of a drug or intervention\u201D is we have to subtract out the placebo effect where people have an expectation that just taking a pill or having an injection or whatever the intervention is, they have an expectation that that will heal and, in fact, it does. It reduces pain, it can reduce inflammation to a certain degree, and it\u2019s hard to estimate and it differs with different conditions. But the percent of effect of the placebo effect in any given intervention has been estimated to be somewhere between 30 and 90 percent. Ninety is probably a little high and 30 may be a little low, so let\u2019s say 50 percent. A drug that has the ability to help reduce pain by 50 percent is a very powerful drug. So, you know, it\u2019s not a trick; it is your brain activating anti-pain pathways releasing those endorphin molecules, releasing those desire molecules, dopamine, to shift and reducing the stress response. It\u2019s in fact the drug that is a trick, right? Because what we do with the drug is trick our brains into doing that. Absolutely, that\u2019s it. You know, so why not use this in a sort of a carefully titrated way and say, OK, why not put the individual who needs to heal into the most healing environment where the stress response is not activated and, to the extent that we can, it\u2019s reduced where you have positive emotional memories that flood you. Put them into a situation where they\u2019re likely to release these positive, these anti-pain molecules and these, you know, dopamine molecules of reward, and that will allow their body to heal or to receive the drugs that you are then giving them. So I\u2019m not saying, you know, don\u2019t go to a desert island and don\u2019t take your cancer chemotherapy, but I\u2019m saying don\u2019t fight against it by putting yourself in a stressful situation. Do the maximum that you can with things like meditation and yoga and prayer to help amplify these pathways in the brain that we know ultimately can help the immune system do its job to heal. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today exploring \u201CThe Science of Place and Healing,\u201D with immunologist Esther Sternberg. It\u2019s very striking to me that, yes, we\u2019re talking about some things like yoga and meditation and prayer. You\u2019re also talking about light and windows and color and the right amount of noise, all of these sensors. Yes, yes, sound, music, yeah. Yeah, but it does turn out that a lot of the examples you give and that other doctors give or end up studying do have some connection with spiritual traditions, whether it\u2019s looking at the architecture of a cathedral or, you know, Richard Davidson studying the brains of meditating monks and therein making some of these amazing discoveries. You also devote a chapter on healing spaces to labyrinths, which is a very ancient phenomenon and kind of being rediscovered in the 21st century. Right, and labyrinths are so interesting, you know, I think partly because of the Minotaur, the Greek myth. Originally when you say labyrinth, people would say, oh, that\u2019s a maze. A labyrinth is very different from a maze. And labyrinths are calming, walking meditations and or allow you to walk calmly and meditate, and mazes are stressful places. So what\u2019s the difference? In a maze, you walk into a maze \u2014 and there\u2019s a wonderful maze outside of Hampton Court near London, which was built by one of the kings of England. You know, you walk into this hedge \u2014 it\u2019s got an eight- or 10-foot hedge \u2014 so right away you don\u2019t see where you\u2019re going. Right, but as you said, a lot of our buildings also feel like mazes when you walk into them, these big corporate buildings. Well, absolutely, and the reason they feel like that, well, hospitals are built like mazes because typically you have the old original small hospital building and then they keep adding wings to it, which hospitals until recently were designed really to optimize the diagnostic tools, you know, the X-ray equipment and the blood-drawing and so on rather than the human being that\u2019s going to be in that building. Airports too. Just think about an airport. Yeah, yeah. But getting back to a maze, and \u2014 and, you know, it\u2019s funny, when I was writing the book, I described these old dusty cathedrals and mazes and things and my editor said on the first draft, \u201CYou\u2019ve got to put something in there that young people would want to read. What about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire?\u201D Of course, I hadn\u2019t read Harry Potter. My daughter was old enough that I hadn\u2019t read any of it, I\u2019m embarrassed to say. So I quickly ran out and bought The Goblet of Fire, and indeed the description of Harry Potter in that maze and how he feels is exactly the stress response. It\u2019s a perfect, perfect description of the physiological stress response that is triggered when you are in a place where you\u2019re trying to navigate it with a time limit, you know. It\u2019s getting dark, you want to do this before it gets dark. You come to a decision point, so you have to have multiple decision points. That\u2019s very stressful. You don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a dead end and, if there is a dead end, there could be a monster lurking there, you know, so the fear is a very primal. Fears are raised by these mazes. And if you put it back to going into a hospital, you\u2019re already stressed because you\u2019re anxious about your illness or your loved one\u2019s illness; you can\u2019t find your way. There are these, as I said, monster machines lurking in different corners where you\u2019re going to be exposed to them. And so it really is a very stressful experience, whereas a labyrinth is just a pattern on the floor. I described the Chartres Labyrinth outside of Paris. From the 13th century. Yes, and it\u2019s just a pattern of stones in the floor, which has been perfectly preserved because the church didn\u2019t look kindly on labyrinths, so they made sure that the benches covered the labyrinth. So as a result, it\u2019s been well preserved. And the rose window of the cathedral is placed in such a way that the sunlight on the summer solstice comes right in and falls directly on the labyrinth. There\u2019s all kinds of theories as to how that came about and all sorts of very interesting theories about these structures that are found all over Europe, also throughout the globe. And there are structures where you walk the path and you find you\u2019ve come to the middle and then you stand and you meditate in the middle or you sit and meditate in the middle and then you walk the path and come out, but you see where you\u2019re going. You don\u2019t have any dead ends. You know, you have all your senses. You can see and hear and you don\u2019t have to think about navigating, and so you\u2019re able to get into this place of peace where you\u2019re just \u2014 there\u2019s something about movement. Right. I have to say, I walked a labyrinth just recently at the new year. I haven\u2019t done that much of it, but also what\u2019s different from what you described about the mazes or being in a hospital is somehow you know exactly where you\u2019re going to step next and you\u2019re not worried about that, but you stop being so oriented towards getting to the end, which is an unusual experience in my life where I\u2019m always ticking off my next thing on my to-do box. You know, that\u2019s a very interesting point that I hadn\u2019t thought of until now. So when you talk about a place of peace, which is really what I\u2019m talking about here, how do you find your place of peace? There is an element of time to it or forgetting time or not worrying about time. And we\u2019re so conscious of worrying about time and the time pressure in our world that it\u2019s hard to strip that away. And things like walking slowly, it forces you to walk slowly, right? You can\u2019t be running through a labyrinth, although I have seen kids running through a labyrinth. You actually feel like slowing down. I\u2019m just thinking about this myself too, but there\u2019s something about the experience that makes you want to draw it out and slow down, and that in itself is kind of an unusual instinct. Yes. I think you\u2019re right. Another similar sort of experience I\u2019ve had is with a Buddhist prayer wheel or drum, I guess it is, that was put into a lovely meditation garden in Sun Valley \u2014 near Sun Valley, Idaho. It was done when the Dalai Lama visited there, and it was a garden especially dedicated to him. When you push this prayer wheel around, it\u2019s actually quite heavy and it forces you to slow down. In order to just turn it around and keep the right pace so you\u2019re not falling off the platform, it really does force you to slow down and look around you and just be quiet and meditate. It\u2019s very striking to me how many of these examples have to do with, it\u2019s like you said, theater people have known this for a long time about creating an environment. And it\u2019s also true of religious spaces and it\u2019s everything from gardens, to prayer wheels, to labyrinths, to stained-glass windows, to incense, to music \u2026 Right, yes. \u2026 actually creating this environment that you are learning helps heal us, can help heal us. Absolutely, absolutely. Isn\u2019t that interesting? It is. And it\u2019s, uh, you know, I talk about frankincense and how fascinating it is that frankincense actually turns out to have immune-boosting features. And, you know, \u2019cause I always \u2014 as a non-Christian, I always thought it was rather odd that \u2026 In the Christmas story, the Three Wise Men? \u2026 that in the Christmas story, the gifts of the Magi, right. You have frankincense, myrrh, and gold, and I said why are they giving these weird things, frankincense and myrrh? They should be giving diamonds and rubies. In fact, those fragrant resins and oils were very \u2014 they were far more valuable than gold or diamonds or rubies in those times because they actually used \u2014 the Roman soldiers \u2014 it was said that the Queen of Sheba was said to have given the plants to King Solomon and then, when the Romans came into the Holy Land, they took those plants back to Rome and had them guarded by sentries because these resins were used to heal after battle, to heal wounds, to prevent infection. And new studies show that in fact frankincense and these kinds of molecules do have beneficial or boosting effects on the immune system. So there\u2019s a lot of, you know, lore that can be studied now in a rigorous scientific way to understand how it works. Listen to this program again and share it with others at onbeing.org. There you can also hear my entire, unedited interview with Esther Sternberg and find a link to our previous conversation, called \u201CStress and the Balance Within.\u201D Coming up, Esther Sternberg on creating portable healing places. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with immunologist Esther Sternberg, exploring new knowledge about how the physical spaces of our lives can stress us, make us sick, or help us be well. One of the influential family friends of Esther Sternberg\u2019s childhood was Hans Selye, a physician who single-handedly coined the word \u201Cstress,\u201D the way we use it now, and implanted it in nearly every major world language. Esther Sternberg later became one of the people who helped explain the physiological and neural connections between stress, illness, and well-being. Now, as we\u2019ve been hearing, she\u2019s working with neuroscientists and architects \u2014 and they\u2019re bringing new science to bear on the way we create our hospitals, workplaces, and homes. I wonder if you\u2019ve ever heard of the recently deceased Irish poet, philosopher John O\u2019Donohue? He talked a lot about landscape and that there are outer landscapes and there\u2019s inner \u2014 there\u2019s an inner landscape, which is another way of talking about, you know, what\u2019s going on in that psalm that your father loved, the Psalm 23, but also that we all have these landscapes. And also, I think his point was we can create them, you know, we can choose to keep images of beauty inside ourselves even when that\u2019s not what is directly around us. I don\u2019t know. I just wonder how you hear that knowing what you know about the science and what\u2019s going on in our brains. Well, I think it\u2019s absolutely true from a scientific point of view. There is a part of the brain that specializes in memory of place, the hippocampus. I mean, it\u2019s important in all sorts of memory, but it\u2019s very key in memory of place. And one of the things that it seems that the hippocampus does is it integrates all of these incoming sensory signals from the visual cortex, from the auditory cortex, from the olfactory bulb. So what you hear and see and smell and touch. The hippocampal cells that are actually called place cells because they tell you where you are in the world, so it\u2019s kind of like your internal GPS system, those little GPS cells actually have inputs from all the sensory modalities in the brain and they integrate those senses and instill the whole in memory. So in fact, from a neuroscience point of view, the poet was right, that we do have an internal place that we can go to from our memories if we could dip into it. Ideally, yes, we would all love to be able to go to our favorite Greek island, you know, and I describe that. Yes, where you had a real healing experience. I had a real healing experience when I went to this tiny village in Crete called Lentos. You know, that was when my arthritis first appeared. I serendipitously ended up going there with neighbors and, in a 10-day period, I began to feel so much better. I didn\u2019t heal. It wasn\u2019t like the miracle of Lourdes, but I realized I could recreate this world at home. So I have on my deck in Washington a gardenia tree and jasmine bush, and I can sit there in the evening in the summer and listen to the crickets and inhale the scent that reminds me of the orange blossoms and lemon blossoms from the Mediterranean. And I have lavender and I have basil, you know, all these fragrant plants that I find very soothing and healing. You can create your own little space wherever it is. And if you don\u2019t have a deck, you can put a few plants in a window. And if you don\u2019t have a window, you can read the 23rd Psalm. And you\u2019re really saying this is medicine. It\u2019s interior decoration maybe on some level, but it\u2019s medicine. It\u2019s medicine and it is being applied now. The wonderful thing is the designers and architects and urban planners can now and are being able to incorporate these features into their designs. So hospitals are being designed with beautiful views and with windows and with places for social support. We haven\u2019t talked about that, but social support is important in healing and with, you know, smells, to mask the horrible smells and the sounds and so on. Right, but you have to create spaces for social support. I mean, even in workplaces. Well, so \u2014 and this is \u2014 it comes back to the practicalities. Yes, so it comes back to the practicalities and why the architects and designers and urban planners need the science, and more and more research is being done now. That\u2019s, I think, the frontier to get the numbers to say it is worth spending extra money up front to put in more of these windows and spaces and so on. And some of the work has been done. The Center for Health Design in San Francisco sponsored, together with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a series of studies called the Pebble Project, where they understood that you\u2019re not going to build a whole hospital from scratch. They started these studies where various aspects of health outcomes were measured in patients in new wings of hospitals that incorporated these different features. And then Derek Parker, who was one of the principals involved in this, added up all of the actual costs from these different kinds of extra wings that were built on 50 different \u2014 or 30 different hospitals and said, OK, this is how much it costs extra. He calculated it would cost about $12 million extra to build such a hospital, but you recouped about $11 million in the first year of operation because of the savings on not only the health of the patients, but the health of the staff. So, you know, that\u2019s the kind of evidence that we need, and more and more is being done now to really document that it\u2019s good not only for the human being in the space that you build, but it\u2019s good for the bottom line. Architects are just embracing this all over the world. So what I tell them when I speak to these audiences is you, the designers, the people who create the built space that we, the rest of us, live in, you are our partners, our meaning the health professionals\u2019 partners, in the health of the nation. You are our partners in prevention of illness, in helping to reduce the stress response, in helping people to find a place of peace because you\u2019re the ones that build those places of peace. Find out more about the Pebble Project on hospital design on our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with immunologist Esther Sternberg. Her latest book is Healing Spaces: The Science of Place and Well-Being. There\u2019s a beautiful succinct and very profound sentence in your writing: \u201CIf illness and health are nouns, then healing is a verb.\u201D I wondered if I could ask you that, on a more personal level, you are one of the people who helped demonstrate the science of how rheumatoid arthritis, for example, is a very good example of how mind and body, emotions and physiology are connected, and you also are a person now who lives with arthritis. So with all of this we\u2019ve been talking about as a background, you know, what does healing look like as you move through the world now and what does it look like differently because of all these things you\u2019re learning? Wow, that\u2019s a good question. So healing, when I say it\u2019s a verb, the body is constantly repairing itself. That\u2019s what life is. You know, a rock just sits there and it eventually gets into sand or mud or something as the elements affect it. But a living being is constantly repairing itself against all of these different insults at a very, you know, molecular level, at a cellular level, at an emotional level. So disease happens when the repair process is not keeping up with the damage process, right? So it\u2019s like very active processes are going on under your skin and actually on your skin at every moment of the day and night. So that\u2019s what healing is to me. There are other, you know, there\u2019s many studies asking the question what is healing, and different people have different concepts of what the word healing is and to be healed. You know, you can die healed if you use the word in an emotional sense. Right, right, not cured but healed. Healed, right. You can feel at peace, you can feel in balance. For me, I guess it is feeling at peace and in keeping up with that damage process. So I have become very conscious of the kinds of things that I do that will trigger my symptoms to be worse and the kinds of things that I can do, to the extent possible, to reduce those symptoms when I\u2019m going overboard. So there\u2019s no question that, when I\u2019m trying to burn the candle at both ends, I get worse. When I don\u2019t sleep enough, I get worse. When I don\u2019t exercise gently on a regular basis, and what I\u2019ve found is the most helpful is swimming three to four days a week or in the summer even more, or walking 30 minutes a day, which has been shown to be beneficial for maintaining health and maintaining the strength of the immune system, having a place to sit and quietly contemplate or meditate, and social support and love is very important. So these are the kinds of things that, when I forget \u2014 you know, I\u2019m human. I do frequently forget and push myself and I get stressed. You know, as Hans Seyle said, \u201CStress is life and life is stress.\u201D I mean, forget about it. You can\u2019t stop stresses from happening. Which actually helps my stress level to acknowledge that. Right. Well, so \u2014 but what happens is, when I do realize that I\u2019m pushing myself too far, I remember how bad I felt when I didn\u2019t stop and I do those things that I know will help me. I did design my deck at home and my sunroom at home in such a way that I do have my place of peace, and actually that\u2019s where I end up doing most of my work. I used to have my computer in a different room and I found that I kept moving it to the sunroom and I finally said, OK, this is obviously where I want to be. I need to have this atmosphere. Well, that\u2019s interesting because I think computers are part of a lot of our stress. But you\u2019re actually saying that maybe even that can be, in the right environment, can be more positive. It gives you a way to \u2014 yes, I mean, one of the things with the stress response is you don\u2019t need to go offline \u2014 I mean, offline, off your brain\u2019s line, not off the computer line \u2014 for very long to kind of reset things. So if you\u2019re cognizant of this, if you feel your stress level mounting, and you just turn away and look at the trees and listen to the birds and be quiet for a few moments. You can bring it down. You can titrate it. You know, there are tools now available that are really offshoots of biofeedback where you can do this, like computer games actually, where you put a little sensor on your finger or your earlobe and it senses your blood flow and it will tell you when you breathe deeply. So deep breathing is one thing that calms you because it reduces the stress response. It kicks in the vagus nerve and that improves heart rate variability and blood flow. We\u2019re going to breath here on the radio. And so you can actually see your heart rate variability improve and shift from a stress mode to a relaxation mode when you use these little games. So you can actually teach yourself to go offline, to have that shift into a relaxation mode on a moment-to-moment basis. And then you can go back and focus on whatever it was you were doing. And being in a place that allows you to do that helps you to do that more efficiently. From that scientist\u2019s scientist who you were when you first started getting into this unlikely connection between emotions and physiology and where you\u2019ve come now as a person who rearranges her physical space thinking of her physiological health, if I ask you this way, how has your sense of what it means to be human \u2014 how do you think that\u2019s changed? Um, how has my sense of being human changed? I think I\u2019m much more accepting of these notions that I was skeptical about before. I was coming from the scientific tradition, and the tradition was if you can\u2019t see it, it isn\u2019t real; if you can\u2019t prove it, it isn\u2019t real. And I think I\u2019m much more accepting that, you know, maybe there is stuff that we can\u2019t see or prove, but that are \u2014 these things really are affecting our emotions and our health. And I think I\u2019m much more open to these new concepts. And so that\u2019s one thing. I am definitely much more conscious of the physical place around me. And I, you know, you started by saying as a person who rearranged my physical space on purpose based on these principles. Actually, it was the other way around: I rearranged my physical space without realizing what I was doing. And then, when the construction was finished, I stood there and looked at it and I said, oh, I just rebuilt my parents\u2019 deck. So that, you know \u2026 That place of peace. Place of peace, right, the memories, the memories. So I guess I\u2019m more aware of these things and I\u2019m able to look at these phenomena and think, oh, OK, now I see why I\u2019m doing that, consciously aware of how place affects me and those around me and my emotions and my health. There is a phrase that especially occurs in Celtic spirituality: thin places. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard that. Yes. The idea is, well, a lot of people would think of cathedrals as thin places or, you know, green pastures, still waters. Um, being in a place where \u2014 and this is the way some people will say it \u2014 it feels like the veil between heaven and earth has worn thin, where there\u2019s a sense of being, you know, planted in the earth and yet also having some kind of almost physical sense of transcendence. I just wonder how you react to that, knowing what you know. Well, I react to that. I have heard of that notion and I am actually very interested in exploring what is it about such places, about beautiful vistas of mountains, about the infinite horizon of the ocean. What is it that makes you feel that way about a cathedral? There are certainly physiological and neuroscientific bases to that feeling, that sense of awe. And I am convinced \u2014 I know \u2014 that these things can be measured and that\u2019s the exciting new frontier for me, to ask exactly that question: What is it that makes one feel transcendent and is the environment something that we can consciously manipulate to find those feelings of transcendence? You know, if we\u2019re so grounded in clay is there a way to at times, by simply going to a different place, achieve that sense of awe and transcendence? Again, I mean, Christopher Wren knew something about that, didn\u2019t he, a couple of hundred years ago? He did, he did. You know, when I visited, it was very interesting because I walked from the Royal Society of Medicine to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which is not a short walk, but a very interesting walk in London. And I got there and it was just before Easter and there was a single man, the soloist, I guess, of the choir, who was practicing. I believe it was from The Messiah. He was standing in the middle of this dome and with this crystal clear voice that rose to the ceiling, it just gave \u2014 gave me shivers. It was really a sense of awe. So it wasn\u2019t only the physical place. It was what that place did to sound. Mm-hmm. I think the most important point that I came to in my own journey in writing this book is that we really can create places of peace not only in our real world, in our physical environment that surrounds us, but in our own mind\u2019s eye. And those kinds of places of peace are portable. As you said, in many different traditions, like the Buddhist tradition or in virtually all religious traditions, you close your eyes and you visualize something. That\u2019s a way of carrying these environments, these healing places, within you. It\u2019s wonderful if you can go to them, but if you can\u2019t, you can bring them to yourself.
