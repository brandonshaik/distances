  "fullText": "I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This hour, we\u2019ll delve into the world and meaning of the upcoming Jewish High Holy Days, from the New Year celebration of Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur\u2019s rituals of atonement, a span of 10 days known as Days of Awe. My guest, Sharon Brous, is an energetic young rabbi and one passionate voice in a Jewish spiritual renaissance that is taking many forms across the U.S. The vast majority of her Los Angeles congregation is in their 20s and 30s. And they, she says, are making life-giving connections between ritual, personal transformation, and relevance in the world. From American Public Media, this is On Being, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. Today, \u201CDays of Awe.\u201D For observant Jews all over the world, Rosh Hashanah is more than a New Year\u2019s celebration. For some, it follows a month of ritual soul-searching. The two days of Rosh Hashanah are a commemoration, not only of a new year, but of the creation of the world. And in them, the faithful stand before divine judgment of their deeds and omissions in the year ending. Rosh Hashanah initiates 10 days of repentance, an attempt to clean the slate for a new year, a renewed life. This culminates in the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Yom Kippur entails long and complex communal prayer, ritual, and fasting, and is accompanied by the long blast of the shofar, the ram\u2019s horn of ancient Israel, and High Holy Day melodies composed across the centuries. This is a traditional setting of Unetane Tokef, a seminal prayer/poem recited during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services. It includes the lines, \u201COn Rosh Hashanah, it is inscribed, and on Yom Kippur, it is sealed. How many shall pass away? And how many shall be born? Who shall live and who shall die? Who shall perish by water and who by fire? Who by earthquake and who by plague? Who shall be at peace? And who shall be pursued? Who shall be exalted? And who shall be brought low?\u201D I think part of the challenge of High Holy Days is to, at some point during the hours and hours and hours that we spend really trying to focus our hearts and our minds over High Holy Days, to bring people to one momentary understanding of the fragility of life. But to take that and to leave with a commitment to live a life in which they\u2019re able to transform themselves and their relationships and the world, knowing that every day they have might be their last. Growing up in New Jersey, my guest, Sharon Brous, never dreamt that she would one day be making such ideas fresh and powerful for a new generation. She saw synagogue as a familial obligation and experienced the High Holy Days, in particular, as a trial to be endured. Today, she\u2019s a rabbi in the Conservative school of Judaism. And she leads a Los Angeles community she helped to found in 2004. It is named IKAR, after the Hebrew word for essence or core. At the core of Jewish faith, for Sharon Brous, spiritual engagement and social justice converge. And as she approaches the High Holy Days, I wondered how does she bring words like judgment and atonement alive in herself and for her 21st-century urban congregation. How does she understand the meaning of the word teshuvah, often translated as \u201Crepentance,\u201D which is a watchword for the entire High Holy Day experience? A couple of things. I mean, one for \u2014 as alienated as people are by the Hebrew in the prayer book, often the English is far worse than the Hebrew, because using words like that that don\u2019t resonate for many of us. At least, the Hebrew, you know that you don\u2019t know it, and so there\u2019s some kind of air of mystery to it. OK. Yeah. Isn\u2019t the, that word in Hebrew quite visual, like stopping in your tracks and turning around the other direction or something like that? That\u2019s exactly what it is. Right. It\u2019s return. It\u2019s literally returning to a right path. And, I mean, the whole Jewish notion of sin is you\u2019ve just gone astray and you can turn it around. And, you know, the principle, the fundamental principles of teshuvah, of return, is that human beings have free will. We have the capacity to make great mistakes. And we have the capacity to turn it around. And of course, there are certain things that there is no full teshuvah that can be affected for because the damage is irreparable, things like murder and sexual assault, and some kinds of public humiliation, that it\u2019s impossible to ever fully turn back. But for everything else, our tradition says it\u2019s possible to turn your life around and to make amends in a way that will heal the breach that you\u2019ve caused in the relationship, either, you know, with yourself, with God, with someone in the community, with the world. And that\u2019s really, I think, also, the ultimate challenge of Rosh Hashanah, which is, we call it, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 in the prayers, we say, \u201CHayom harat olam\u201D \u2014 \u201CToday is the birthday of the world.\u201D And Rosh Hashanah is this, it\u2019s this moment in which we celebrate the creation of the world, which meant nothing to me, you know, when I heard that growing up is \u2026 Right. Right. \u201CToday, we celebration the creation of the world,\u201D that means nothing. Right. But what does mean something to me is the fact that each one of us participates in creation every single day, when we make a choice about how we want to live in the world. And then, you know, there are ways in the liturgy and in the religious \u2014 in Jewish religious practice, in which every single day, we strive to kind of identify the things that need to be transformed in our lives. But the tradition also gets that it\u2019s not enough to, you know, that doing it every day sort of, it might lose some of its power. And so we need to have this, you know, this moment in time that\u2019s part of the calendrical cycle, that\u2019s, you know, sort of built in to the calendar. This kind of dramatic High Holy Days \u2014 where everything stops. Exactly, in which we stop everything. Right. And, I mean, even many \u2014 you know, secular Jews or people who don\u2019t identify, oh, will still stop and kind of recognize it\u2019s Rosh Hashanah or it\u2019s Yom Kippur. And we have this shofar, which blasts in our ears. And it\u2019s not supposed to be beautiful and melodious. It\u2019s supposed to really wake you up and say, \u2018Look at yourself. Are you the mother you want to be? Are you the friend you want to be? Are you the American you want to be? Are you the human being that you want to be in the world?\u2019 The call of the ancient ram\u2019s horn, or shofar, punctuates the 30 days of introspection leading to Rosh Hashanah and the 10 Days of Awe through Yom Kippur. The sage of the Talmud, the 12th-century philosopher Maimonides, interpreted the call of the shofar at Rosh Hashanah in this way: \u201CAwake, you sleepers, from your slumber. Examine your deeds. Return in repentance and remember your creator.\u201D Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services build on prayers and confessions of mistakes, transgressions, and ethical lapses, both individual and communal. My sense is that a lot of what\u2019s happening in the liturgy and this incredibly rich and complex liturgy of High Holy Days is that the rabbis are trying to very cautiously push us to confront the parts of ourselves that we are simply not open to confronting when we walk in the door. And so it\u2019s, in some ways, it\u2019s very subtle, what they\u2019re trying to do. But listing, there\u2019s the Viddui, the confessional, which is always said in the plural \u201CAshamnu, bagadnu,\u201D \u201CWe did this, we did this\u201D and \u2026 And you go through, is it right, you go through every single letter of the alphabet, am I right? Yes. Yes, that\u2019s right, and over and over and over. We do the Vidduimultiple times over the course of the day of Yom Kippur. And the idea is, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 You know, you sort of walk in and someone gives you a list of sins that you\u2019re supposed to publicly state that you committed. Right. And this is intensely countercultural, because all of our impulse and all of the norms of society push us to deny and reject responsibility for the things that we\u2019re doing wrong. You know, or I think to \u2014 you know, to get over it, to move on once, right, and not relive it every year. And this says, \u2018We did these things. Each one of us did these things.\u2019 And even if you personally didn\u2019t do it, someone in this community did it. So \u2026 So, what \u2014 give me an example. So what are you saying, for example, ethical lapses, sins? I mean, what would they be? I immediately go to, you know, to think about sort of the broad social and political, ethical lapses that we have. I mean, the fact that we, in Los Angeles, live in a city with 86,000 people sleeping on the streets. And so does that mean that I personally am responsible for making, you know, people, creating homelessness? Or does that mean that I am responsible, because I live in a society that allows certain people to remain in positions of privilege and power and to turn a blind eye to people who \u2014 you know, who have tremendous suffering in their life? And so how can we take \u2014 start to take ownership and responsibility of some of the terrible problems that are happening in our society and in our world? So, I mean, it\u2019s the \u2026 So that\u2019s a sin that you would confess at Yom Kippur? Yes. Yes. And we, I mean, and in the beginning, when you walk in the door, you\u2019re not necessarily ready to take responsibility for that. I mean, I\u2019m thinking about, you know, the way that I hurt my sister\u2019s feelings, the way that I was embarrassed by my mother in the supermarket because, you know, even though I\u2019m in my 30s, she can still embarrass me in the supermarket. You know, I\u2019m sort of thinking about those things. But, and I think that there\u2019s this development, there\u2019s this flow to the service, in which you start by \u2014 you know, sort of in the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, you start by acknowledging and taking responsibility for the little things that have happened in your life, the little ways in which you\u2019ve made mistakes. And by the end of Yom Kippur, you\u2019re just, your soul is on fire, because you start to recognize that it\u2019s all connected. And it\u2019s not just, you know, the conversation that I should have had with, you know, with my best friend that I didn\u2019t have that led her astray. It\u2019s also about, you know, the genocide in Darfur. And it\u2019s about poverty and hunger and homelessness. And it\u2019s all connected. It\u2019s \u2014 like you kind of awaken yourself or open yourself up to this much broader sense of responsibility, which we, I think we protect ourselves from during most of the year, because we simply can\u2019t hold all of that at once without being paralyzed. Right. There is this paralysis. I mean, I think about this a lot. I think about how people in my profession, journalists, how we present people with these images of suffering, right? And violence and things that go wrong that, therefore, become headlines. And I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s overwhelming for people. And it\u2019s very hard for people to make that connection when they are often just struggling to hold their lives together, right? Or to be a good parent or to be a good spouse or just to be a good force in their community or their neighborhood, right? Or their city. Yeah. It\u2019s very hard to connect the dots between my life and that world of pain and suffering out there. So I guess what I want to ask you is, is there something that happens when those connections are made in that liturgy, in that context of religious community, of Jewish community? Is there someway in which people are able to live with that differently, to hold those tensions, to walk out of there, you know, and have an idea about how to live differently because they\u2019ve made them? I hope so. And I think that that\u2019s really our job. And the way that we do that is taking people on a journey. You know, we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t start off by when people come in on Erev Rosh Hashanah, you know, the first night of Rosh Hashanah, I don\u2019t start off by saying, you know, \u2018Look at you. What are you doing about the mess of the world?\u2019 You know? We start off by saying, because I see this journey that sort of takes us from, as I call it, you know, as I understand it, it\u2019s really journey from Heshbon HaNefesh, which is an accounting of the soul of the individual to Heshbon Nefesh HaMishpaha to, sort of, looking at the way that we are in our family\u2019s accounting of the soul of our families. Heshbon Nefesh HaAm, this is by the time we get to Yom Kippur, an accounting of the soul of the Jewish people. And ultimately, Heshbon Nefesh HaOlam, an accounting of the soul of the whole world. And, you know, our rabbis acknowledge that the way to transformation of the world starts, it starts with the self, it\u2019s through the self. And so we have to, not only not disregard, but be truly attentive and sincerely attentive to really accounting for what\u2019s happening in our own personal lives first, you know, first and foremost. And so we do that. We look with, really, we scrutinize what\u2019s going on in our own lives. And, by the way, sometimes it\u2019s hard to get there because people have so many barriers up. They don\u2019t want to look at their own lives, and it\u2019s much easier for them to think about Darfur than it is to \u2026 To look at poverty in Africa, yes. Exactly, exactly. And, you know, I often think about those Matryoshka dolls, those little Russian wooden dolls? Yes, yes. And, you know, I remember my, my grandparents used to have these in their homes. And when I was a kid. I was, sort of, obsessed with playing with these little dolls and you\u2019d, sort of, peel away layer after layer after layer and you\u2019d finally come to this tiny little doll in the middle, which, like, almost didn\u2019t even resemble the biggest doll on the outside anymore because, you know, It\u2019s just this tiny, pure essence of doll in the middle of all of these layers and layers of, you know, beautiful paint and gloss. And I feel like that\u2019s what the experience of High Holy Days is about, you know? You sort of begin by saying there is a Nekudat Tova, there is something so pure and so good inside of you, inside of all of us, but we can\u2019t even see what it is anymore, because we spend all year kind of papering over it and covering over it either, because we\u2019re too busy, because, you know, our lives and our work are too challenging, you know, or because we\u2019re too embarrassed of it and we don\u2019t, you know, we\u2019re, sort of, ashamed, embarrassed. And so we cover over them, we paper over and layer over it and the, and, you know, you kind of walk in on Erev Rosh Hashanah and you hear these melodies that just, kind of, stir the soul of even a person who\u2019s, you know, maybe only been to services, you know, in their early childhood and only out of guilt, you know \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 that we hear these tunes that are only sung on High Holy Days. And, like, layer by layer, you\u2019re, sort of, stripped down to the core. Rabbi Sharon Brous. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from American Public Media. Today, \u201CDays of Awe.\u201D We\u2019re walking through themes and traditions of the approaching Jewish High Holy Days. Readings from the Torah, the foundational first five books of the Hebrew Bible also known as the five books of Moses, are another central part of this experience. They begin at Rosh Hashanah with the 21st chapter of Genesis and the birth of Isaac the Patriarch, the son and heir God promised to Abraham and Sarah. The stories recounted here are rich with the light and dark of human nature. The name Isaac, Yitzhak in the Hebrew, means \u201Che laughs,\u201D a play on the fact that his mother laughed when God told her she would bear a child in extreme old age. But an Egyptian slave, Hagar, had already given Abraham a son, Ishmael. And after Isaac is born, as the biblical story recounts, Sarah orders Abraham to banish Hagar and Ishmael. He does so reluctantly. The God rescues them and says, \u201CI will make a nation of him also because he is your offspring.\u201D Ishmael becomes the ancestor of Arabs. And through him, Muslims traced their ancestry back to Abraham. The stories that we read from the Torah and Rosh Hashanah are so interesting. What I find somewhat outstanding is how it\u2019s not obvious what the rabbis were trying to do here, but it\u2019s brilliant that they chose these readings for these moments. So \u2026 OK. Tell me about that. It\u2019s the first day of Rosh Hashanah, you know, Jews who never go to synagogue all year long will show up on, you know, Rosh Hashanah morning and, you know, this is a, it\u2019s a Torah portion. The Torah portion that it comes from has, you know, arguably, two of the most famous and most profound episodes of the entire Torah. They have Abraham arguing with God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and where you see this real, like, this fierce human defiance in the sense of, you know, that there\u2019s no moral ambiguity here. It\u2019s just human beings fighting for what\u2019s right in the world. And then on, you know, on the other side of the Torah portion, there\u2019s the Akedat Yitzhak, the binding of Isaac, you know, God saying to Abraham, \u2018Take your son and sacrifice him.\u2019 Right, right. So what do we read on Rosh Hashanah? Neither of those things. We come and we read these little stories that come in the middle, in between those two things, which is, it\u2019s so fascinating. It\u2019s like you have all the Jews you want in the world sitting in services and you\u2019re not telling them, you know, the great major moral lessons of the Torah, but you\u2019re telling them instead, you know, about Sarah being jealous of Hagar \u2026 Yes. \u2026 because, you know, and the way that, that Isaac and Ishmael fought with each other and Abraham, sort of, struggling \u2014 should he listen to Sarah or Hagar \u2014 and needing to kick his own, you know, family out of the house. It\u2019s, kind of, these very small stories of dysfunction in, you know, in our ancestors\u2019, you know, families. Yes, perhaps, small stories of dysfunction, but a family feud that is arguably at the center of some of the hardest things that are happening in the world today, right? Because Ishmael, it becomes an ancestor of, of Muslims. I mean, how do you think about what that story says to Jews today? I understand it in a couple of different ways. I mean, on one level, it\u2019s really saying, you know, our God is not the God of the Jews. Our God is God. And, you know, Abraham was not the father of the Jewish people. Abraham was, you know, was the father of Ishmael and Isaac. He didn\u2019t have only one son. He had two sons. And, you know, ultimately, like, taking us back to, you know, to, sort of, the creation of our faith, the origin story of our faith, where we realize that we are in this story with other human beings in the world. So our obligations in the world cannot, simply cannot extend only to other Jews. So this is one rendering of, you know, of what, you know, these particular Torah stories are doing on Rosh Hashanah. And the other pieces of it that I also think is very powerful, which is not about the universalism, is actually, I think, about honoring and recognizing that these small stories and the jealousies that one woman feels toward another and the confusion that one man feels about his, you know, his partner and his love and the jealousy and the conflict between two siblings. These stories of dysfunction are ours; they are our stories. Right. That, you know, every single one of us has some kind of conflict in our families and in our homes that has shaped who we are in the world for better and for worse. And so I look at these stories as an opportunity for us to, to hear the absence of the big stories and really focus on the small stories in between. It\u2019s not just, you know, what, like, you know, your father died this year. There was this incredibly painful thing that transformed your family, or you got married this year and there\u2019s this incredibly beautiful celebration. But what happened in between those things? How are you treating your partner on the day when there aren\u2019t any, you know, camera crews and families that have flow in to celebrate with you? How do you look at each other when you wake up in the morning? How do you talk to your kids when you\u2019re frustrated, because you\u2019ve called them down for dinner seven times and they\u2019re not coming? You know? How do we engage each other in the small stories? And I think that\u2019s incredibly important in this moment of hayom harat olam, today is the birthday of the world. We have this big mission in the world. There\u2019s something for us to do as Jews. Well, how are you treating your family, you know? How are you talking to the people you love? You know, I have to say that, while I\u2019m listening to your talk, both about, about that, about how we think about family these days and how we\u2019re able to talk about it. And also about this large themes of being Jewish and also this, you know, being Jewish, maybe, meaning that you have to be in relationship with those others. I think about these, the richness of Jewish tradition and I just, you know, I mean, the whole historic tradition and, of the Talmud, of conversation across generations, of midrash and, kind of, making the story your own in every new generation. And, I mean, I really hear you doing that, because I think the way you\u2019re reading that story of the relationship with, between Isaac and Ishmael is going to be different in the 21st century than a rabbi would have been reading it 50 years ago or, say, 60 years ago in the middle of a world of, you know, of the Holocaust and World War II. I mean, it does speak to our dynamics in a completely new way, doesn\u2019t it? Yeah, that\u2019s right. And, I mean, that\u2019s what, that\u2019s what I think the rabbis meant when they said that the Torah was given down in fire, meaning on Mount Sinai. The mountain was on fire when the Torah came down. And in Torah, it has to be transmitted. And if we don\u2019t find some way to make this religious experience about more than just the memory of something that once touched our great-great-grandparents \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 it\u2019s simply not going to exist anymore. And so, I mean, so what does it mean to me? And, by the way, not only does it mean something different to me than it meant to my grandparents, it means something different to me this year than it meant to me last year. Right, right. And that, sort of, you know, the great power of a religious tradition. It\u2019s versatile enough to really sustain itself over the course of many thousands of years to say, you know, the text is the same every year, but we are different. That really is, there is something new born every time that I encounter this text or this holiday or this piece of, you know, this piece of liturgy. Rabbi Sharon Brous.

I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Stay with us. On Being comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to On Being, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics, and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CDays of Awe.\u201D With the young Los Angeles rabbi Sharon Brous, we\u2019re delving into the rituals and meaning behind the upcoming Jewish High Holy Days, 10 days that begin with the New Year, Rosh Hashanah, and end with the intense ritual and total fasting of the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. Sharon Brous is a rabbi in the Conservative school of Judaism and is part of a Jewish spiritual renaissance that is taking place in various forms across the U.S. It melds deepened spiritual practice and Jewish identity with social justice engagement. Sharon Brous is a rabbi to REBOOT, an eclectic gathering of Jewish cultural creatives. They\u2019re focused on engaging questions of Jewish identity and community through artistic, literary, and social encounters. Rabbi Brous\u2019s community, IKAR, was inspired by Congregation B\u2019nai Jeshurun in New York City where she came back to Jewish worship after years away and later served as a rabbinic fellow. B\u2019nai Jeshurun is considered revolutionary by many for its inclusive approach to liturgy, social justice, and interfaith matters. IKAR, which is composed primarily of people in their 20s and 30s, describes itself as both traditional and progressive. Many of IKAR\u2019s 370 family and individual members previously defined themselves as unaffiliated or disaffected from Jewish tradition. Here are a few members of that community singing Psalm 137. By the waters of Babylon, where we sat down, and where we wept when we remembered Zion. By the waters of Babylon \u2026 One of the ideas at Rosh Hashanah is that two books are opened before the heavenly judge: the Book of Life and the Book of Death. I mean, those are such huge and strange images. Mm-hmm. So, I mean, how \u2014 do you think images like that can come to life for \u2014 or how do images like that come to life for modern people in Los Angeles? Right. Look, not everything works. I mean, not everything resonates. Yeah. And so, and I think this is part of the beauty of really engaging in the tradition seriously and with an open heart. It\u2019s just like how in your own family everything doesn\u2019t always work. Right. But sort of recognizing that this is mine and what works for me now might not work for me next year. And what works for next year might not work for me now. And, I mean, I\u2019ve had people in my community who have been diagnosed with cancer who say, \u2018I now get for the first time what it means to pray to a warrior God, because I want God to be fighting the cancer in my body.\u2019 And I never would have thought about God that way before, because I\u2019m a pacifist, you know? And so I mean, and there are things that happen in our lives and in the world that open us up to the possibility of, you know, different interpretations of things. And so I don\u2019t take things out of the book. I struggle with things, and there are things that I scream out against. I mean, I see them and I think, oh, this, you know, this either just doesn\u2019t speak to me or this just seems wrong, but it\u2019s still in the book, because next year I might get it in a different way. And I think that\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s sort of some kind of religious humility in a way. It\u2019s to say, like, it doesn\u2019t work for me at all, and yet I\u2019m going to continue to struggle with it, or I\u2019m at least going to continue to keep it on the page. And I had this experience, you know, in rabbinical school about every six months, and I was really in a love affair with the study of Talmud and \u2026 Yes. \u2026 rabbinic text. And about every six months I would come across some text that I found utterly paralyzing as a woman, as a human being, as a Jew, I just felt like this is the text I\u2019m in love with and this is what it\u2019s saying. How can I, you know, how can I deal with that? And I came to recognize those moments as incredible gifts also, because the relationship with Judaism should be no different than your relationship with your, you know, with your partner, your spouse, or your kids. When you find things about them that you don\u2019t like and you have to live with nevertheless. That\u2019s exactly right. And you struggle with it. Can you remember an example? Yeah, sure I can. OK. There\u2019s a story in (speaking Hebrew), in this Tract 8 of Talmud that talks \u2014 it\u2019s talking about sexual relationships. And it\u2019s \u2014 it says that a husband and wife are allowed to do \u2014 basically, they\u2019re allowed to do whatever they want with each other sexually. You can enjoy each other, that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s not heretical. I mean, we\u2019re not an ascetic tradition and that\u2019s permissible. So then there\u2019s a story in which a woman comes before Rav, one of the great rabbis, and says, \u201CMy husband did this thing to me, and it\u2019s caused me incredible pain.\u201D And Rav says, \u201CWhat can I do? The Torah permits you to him.\u201D And like, sort of throws his hands up in the air. And so, you know, I read things like that and I think of where is the, like, where is the understanding of human relationships here. Like, where is the understanding of how men and women operate and how law interacts with humanity. And you know, sort of read things like that. Even in the Book of Deuteronomy. I mean, this is not a rabbinic text but a biblical text, but you know, the punishment for raping a woman is marrying her. But you \u2014 your punishment is that you need to spend \u2014 you marry her and you\u2019re not allowed to divorce her. And you know, you read things like that and, I \u2014 read things like that and I think, my god, you know, this tradition is so painful in some ways and if I were writing the book, I would not have written that, I\u2019m quite sure of it. Right. Right. You know? But I didn\u2019t write the book and the wisdom that flows from this text comes from the same source as the excruciating pain that flows from it. And I feel now that that\u2019s part of being in a relationship with the, you know, with a tradition that\u2019s thousands of years old. And what\u2019s so powerful to me about this is, because I\u2019ve cried so many tears over texts like this, I feel like my tears are now part of the mix of the, you know, of the conversation of Jews who, for the past 2,000 years, have used these texts as their, really, as their sustenance. There\u2019s an amazing story that one of my teachers, Rabbi David Weiss Halivni, teaches and shares in one of his books. He\u2019s a Holocaust survivor and he was in one of the death camps and he was working and they came back for this day out laboring all day long, you know, on the verge of death, and from exhaustion and from hard labor, and from despair. And he saw this security guard who was eating this sloppy sandwich in a wrapper. And it was wrapped in this piece of paper, and he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it, because he recognized that there were Hebrew letters written on the paper. So they traded their, you know, their food for the day in order to get this piece of sloppy paper that was holding together this sandwich. And he gave it to them, and they dried it out and it turned out to be a piece of Talmud. And I guess one of the ways that, you know, the Jews were degraded was they would take our holy text and use them in really, you know, like, you know, a variety of reasons. And so they took this piece of Talmud and he describes how the men in the bunker used to sit together every night when they come home from the field and just read this piece of Talmud together. And it saved their lives. But just looking at this text made them feel like human beings again and made them feel like they were part of a story that was, you know, thousands of years long and wouldn\u2019t die with them. It would continue, somehow, beyond them. And I think about that often, and I think about the voices that were \u2014 that have been a part of that story. And the voices like mine, you know, women\u2019s voices that weren\u2019t a part \u2026 Right. Right. \u2026 of those stories. And how do we start to fill in, you know, the conversation that\u2019s in the white parts of the page in between the black letters? You know, the white space in between the letters and part of it is through tears. And that is the spirit of midrash, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. OK. And so, I mean, literally like I love when I\u2019m studying and I cry and I see a teardrop fall into my book. I feel like that\u2019s the holiest act, because I\u2019m leaving my imprint here, too, because men could have read that for thousands of years and not cried. When I read that, I cry. I really do. Right. So, and now I feel like that\u2019s part of being in love, that, you know, sort of really struggling in that way, and knowing that something\u2019s wrong and that my partner, this tradition, has made mistakes and you know, God knows so have I. And it\u2019s, in some ways, you know, it\u2019s good to know that the tradition is not perfect. Rabbi Sharon Brous. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being from American Public Media. Today, \u201CDays of Awe.\u201D We\u2019re exploring the rituals and meaning behind the upcoming High Holy Days of Judaism: Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. You\u2019ve written about one of the things that is affected by the High Holy Days as a renegotiated marriage, right? Between God and humankind and that the people who are observing this \u2014 these holy days. Right. Talk to me about what kind of God and what kind of relationship between humankind and God is made real in you through these liturgies and through these religious ideas behind them. And maybe you can only answer that question for this year, because next year will be different. I think this idea \u2014 I\u2019m very struck by the idea of a renegotiated marriage, which, I think, I heard for the first time from Rabbi Art Green, just this idea that we get to set the marriage back on course. We\u2019re periodically given this opportunity to realign and to set straight our priorities again, and to redefine what kind of relationship we even want to be in. I believe that \u2026 With God? With God, and I believe that we need to fix ourselves and God needs to fix God\u2019s self also. And \u2014 I mean, there are some incredibly beautiful prayers. A very famous one from Rav Levi Yitzchak, the Berditchev rebbe who writes this prayer, where he says, you know, \u2018God, I did my work this year but where are you?\u2019 You know, \u2018How could you let the world look the way that it does?\u2019 And this is an opportunity for us to look in a really brutal way at ourselves and say, you know, \u2018Where have I not been the human being I need to be in the world? And where have I let myself down and let other people down, and let God down?\u2019 And also to look at God and say, \u2018Where are the ways that I feel that I have been let down by God?\u2019 Because what I believe ultimately the brit, the covenant, is about God wanting us to make those demands also. God wanting us to hold God to the fire and say, like, \u2018Wait a minute, this isn\u2019t what you promised? Like, how could you let this person get sick? Or, how could you let this thing happen in the world?\u2019 And that\u2019s OK for us to, you know, to offer that kind of expression to God. God actually wants to be in a relationship like that with us. And, but we have to do it for ourselves also. I mean, that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s the first step is to really have the courage and the integrity to look at ourselves and say, \u2018God, I\u2019ve fallen short.\u2019 You know? \u2018I haven\u2019t been what I could be in the world and here You gave me, you know, the capacity with my mind and my body and my spirit to do extraordinary things in the world. And because of my distractions and my insecurities and my self-doubt and my, you know, and my sins, you know, the things I\u2019ve done that have just been wrong, I haven\u2019t been everything You\u2019ve wanted in the world.\u2019 To really start from that place and then grow, you know, to the place where we say, \u2018God, and You haven\u2019t either.\u2019 And you said mind, body, and spirit. And one thing I\u2019ve heard about worship in your congregation is that it is full-body worship, and I think Jewish prayer is full-body prayer. But I\u2019ve also heard that you, that people are fully prostrated in your synagogue and, you know, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s a very ancient practice, but it\u2019s a \u2014 and it actually is a practice in many other parts of the world and in other traditions, but it\u2019s pretty much lost in Western culture except in Orthodoxy, I suppose. Right. Right. And so talk to me about what that means in a very modern congregation in a modern American city. Why is that important to you? And what does it do to people? I mean, how does it play into this renegotiated marriage? Yeah. There was recently a terrible tragedy in my community. There was a man who died. And I was speaking with the family, and part of the challenge for them was \u2014 in particular, for the mother \u2014 was not being able to control what was happening, because she just wanted to take care of everything and make everything OK. And, like, there was just this recognition that she simply couldn\u2019t \u2014 that there was nothing that she could do to change what had happened and to, you know, and to bring some closure to this any more quickly, you know, that it would come. And I thought, as I was talking to her, I thought about Aleinu, this moment that you\u2019re describing in the High Holy Day service, where, I mean, this feels so un-Jewish to people. What, the idea of prostrating like putting your whole body on the ground. Yeah. It feels, it just feels like it\u2019s, you know, from another tradition and from another time. But it\u2019s this idea of recognizing for one moment that we simply cannot control everything. And you know, for people who really spend their days trying to get control over their inbox and control over their \u2026 Yeah. \u2026 you know, their work-life and control over their kids and control over their \u2014 the way their bodies, you know, look and the way that, you know, the way that everything, which I mean \u2026 Our aging. Yeah. Exactly. Like, you don\u2019t like the way you look, you get surgery. You know, we try to exert control over all aspects of our life and there are just moments when you realize that you just can\u2019t control everything. And what happens to a person kind of spiritually when they allow themselves to acknowledge that the world is bigger than them, and that there is, there sometimes, there\u2019s something greater at play than just what we\u2019re able to control with our own hands. And the act of putting ourselves down on the ground, and I, you know, when I do it, I hold my hands up to, like my hands are facing upwards, it\u2019s just saying, I can\u2019t do it all. I just can\u2019t \u2014 like I need you to hold me in this moment, because I can\u2019t control it, I can\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t have all the answers. There\u2019s this moment of incredible profundity that comes from the recognition that no matter how hard we try, we simply cannot control everything. And I, you know, I ask everyone to do it and I say, the more uncomfortable you are with this, the more important it is that you do it because, you know, spiritual wakefulness does not come from doing the things that feel easy and comfortable to us. It just doesn\u2019t. It comes from really pushing ourselves, like we get this about physical workouts. I mean, think of physical therapy and like, you aren\u2019t going to get better \u2026 Right. \u2026 if you don\u2019t push yourself in a way that hurts. And people who are in mourning and have suffered loss and who just need to be held, I want to hold them. And those people who just, who\u2019ve created \u2014 some image or some understanding of their lives as, you know, as perfect and everything\u2019s fine, and, you know, that sort of leads to this great complacency. My job is to break them down, you know, to say get down on the ground and put your hands up in the air and say, \u2018I cannot do it. I need help from someone or something bigger than me in the world.\u2019 You know, when I was preparing to interview you, I was reading just a number of things. And I read a New York Times article \u2014 this is from a decade ago \u2014about B\u2019nai Jeshurun, the congregation, that really cutting-edge congregation that you ran in New York. And here\u2019s what a journalist said: \u201CThe reasons for this sudden growth are reflective of the times when baby boomers of all denominations are turning to religion to ease the ragged passage through middle age.\u201D Mm-hmm. What you\u2019re describing, though, is not about, is not about making yourself feel better, you know \u2026 In some ways it\u2019s about making yourself feel worse. Right. Right. Right. And yet you\u2019re also having a wonderful, growing, vibrant congregation. So how do you explain that? Right. Look, I mean, this kind of dismissive observation about B\u2019nai Jeshurun, you know, I hear people talk about my generation, about people in their 20s and 30s all the time by saying this is the most narcissistic generation \u2026 Right. \u2026 in the history of the world. Now I believe that they probably said that about every generation, but they specifically say about this one. But if that\u2019s true, your congregation should be empty, right? Right, exactly. I mean, they particularly say it, because, I think, because of technology. Because of iPods and e-mails and instant messaging, this generation does have the ability to sort of access whatever it wants, when it wants it. You know, you don\u2019t listen to the radio anymore, kind of, and you know, hoping to hear your favorite song, you just download your favorite song. And as soon as you don\u2019t like it anymore, you wipe it off to your iPod and you know, it just, it\u2019s just different. And so you know, there\u2019s this question like in this generation and kind of instant gratification and instant access and you know, and real narcissism, how do you, you know, how do you move people from the service of the self into a service of the world? And a lot of people just throw their hands up in the air and really, I will tell you that what I hear over and over and over from the Institutional Jewish World is, \u2018Let\u2019s forget about them. They\u2019ll come back when they have kids and they need religious school.\u2019 And you know, there\u2019s this kind of like, throw your hands in the air. They don\u2019t want this, because they\u2019re narcissistic or they want \u2026 Right. \u2026 instant gratification and you don\u2019t get that from a serious study of Talmud. You know, it takes, you can study one paragraph for five weeks and you come to the word teiku at the end, which means \u201Cthere\u2019s no answer.\u201D We don\u2019t know the answer. And like, the common wisdom is this generation wouldn\u2019t go for that. And I say, you know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s simply not true that, I mean, there is a human need that I believe transcends generational differences, transcends time. There\u2019s a human need for meaning, for purposeful connection, for community, and for real engagement in the world. I love this line from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel that I\u2019ve seen you quote a couple of times: \u201CPrayer is our humble answer to the inconceivable surprise of living.\u201D Beautiful. Yes. And so many people who will come into services, like, and so many people walk around in life so aware of what they don\u2019t have, you know, what they long for: the love that they haven\u2019t found yet, the, you know, the absence. They\u2019re so aware of the absence. And what Heschel says to us is, \u2018Look at the presents, like figure out what you do have. Look at the world with awe and wonder, and the amazing miracle that your skin holds the blood inside your body.\u2019 You know, that nature works the way that it works, that the world is as extraordinary as it is, because there\u2019s so many things wrong but there are so many incredible blessings around us. And our, part of our spiritual challenge is to, he says, it is gratefulness that makes the soul great. And so, you know, find a way to be grateful for what we do have, because it\u2019s simply not fair to live in a world and only be conscious of what you do not have. I was talking earlier about this, about Unetane Tokef this incredible climactic prayer that comes in the High Holy Day services, and you know, it\u2019s kind of pushing us to engage the reality of our, the possibility of our own death, who will live and who will die. I mean, what this prayer basically says is realize that you cannot control if you will live or die, but you can control the way that you\u2019re going to live and, you know, over the course of the year, and that\u2019s not some vague, you know, amorphous, you know, like ambiguous statement, like feel good. But it actually means go out and do these three things: build a spiritual life for yourself, fix your relationships, and fight for justice in the world, because ultimately those are the three things that matter in life. Sharon Brous is the founding rabbi of IKAR in Los Angeles. And who by fire? Who by water? And who in the sunshine? Who in the nighttime? And who by high ordeal? Who by common trial? Who in your merry, merry month of May? And who by very slow decay? And who shall I say is calling? This song, Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201CWho by Fire,\u201D is one Sharon Brous\u2019s favorite songs during the High Holy Days. The lyrics are based on the Unetane Tokef prayer recited in this sacred time. On our website, you can listen to this song again and read about the rich history of some of the music we selected for this program in a blog entry on Pertinent Posts from the On Being Blog.
