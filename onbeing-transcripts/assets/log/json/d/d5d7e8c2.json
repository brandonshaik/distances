  "fullText": "Kevin Kling is part funny guy, part poet and playwright, part wise man. A treasured figure on the national storytelling circuit, his life and art are now the subject of a documentary, Kevin Kling: Lost and Found. His voice inhabits an unusual space where a homegrown Minnesota wit meets Dante and Shakespeare. And his stories are revealing of life\u2019s humor and its ruptures. He was born with a birth defect \u2014 his left arm disabled and much shorter than his right. Then, in his early 40s, a motorcycle accident nearly killed him and paralyzed his healthy right arm. Being able-bodied, Kevin Kling helpfully points out, is always only a temporary condition. We take in his wisdom on the losses we\u2019re born with and the losses we grow into, and on why we turn these things into stories. By telling a story, things don\u2019t control me anymore. It\u2019s in my vernacular; it\u2019s the way I see the world. And I think that\u2019s why our stories ask our questions, our big questions, like, where do we come from \u2014 before life, after life? What\u2019s funny in this world, or sacred? And even more importantly, by the asking in front of people and with people, even if we don\u2019t find the answer, by the asking, we know we\u2019re not alone. And I have found that often that\u2019s even more important than the answer. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Kevin Kling grew up in Osseo, Minnesota. I interviewed him in 2012. He arrived for our conversation wearing his signature horn-rimmed glasses and a plaid shirt. His paralyzed right arm rests in a sling on his leg. There\u2019s something childlike, mischievous, and endearing in Kevin Kling\u2019s eyes and his smile that live audiences warm to immediately. And most of his stories include some reference point from childhood: of growing up making fun of his own disability, of antics with his little brother, who was bigger than him. Kevin Kling describes his family as \u201Cfirst-generation-off-the-farm\u201D \u2014 but deeply imprinted by his grandfather, \u201Cwho always smelled like tractor grease, even in church.\u201D And he remembers his grandmother\u2019s kitchen as \u201Can artist\u2019s studio\u00A0\u2014 \u201Cand whatever my grandpa provided as a medium, in a gesture she transformed, teased, poached, or pickled.\u201D It seems to me that, already, at the beginning of your life, when you were a little kid, you totally became enchanted with the raw materials of stories, which are words. Do you remember how that happened, or what was that like? As I look back, I \u2014 language in our family \u2014 we loved language. We loved to laugh. My family loved to laugh. But more importantly \u2014 and this is early to touch on this, already \u2014 but I have to say my left arm, being born with a disability, I think led me to becoming a storyteller, because rhetoric is immediately obvious and different for someone with a disability, because you\u2019re referred to and talked about in words that no one else is referred to. And so when people \u2014 I know when they would say my arm was \u201Cwithered\u201D or \u201Ccrippled\u201D or say, \u201COh, you poor thing,\u201D or, \u201CWhat happened?\u201D Words they chose, I could tell if they blamed my parents, or me, or God, or themselves for my condition. And then with that information, I could get what I needed out of them. Well, right. And that\u2019s the other \u2014\u00A0you used the disability, you also definitely used it as a kid just as you \u2026 But it\u2019s as a kid would. As a kid, you\u2019re looking for your angles, you know? And you\u2019re looking for that all the time. But that also did really lead me to the power of rhetoric and the power of words, and down the road to storytelling, and stories throughout my life. I was always blessed to be around good storytellers. What did you say? I thought this was a great line: \u201CAs a teen I learned your night before was only as good as your ability to tell about it.\u201D Right, that was \u2014 yeah, that was in college with my buddies. Yeah. You\u2019ve written about words in phrases like \u201Ctrafficking in the alphabet,\u201D \u201Cwords, like dormant gods waiting to unleash their power.\u201D But I think the context you just described is \u2014 it shines a different light on that power of words. And you\u2019re very theological. I don\u2019t know if you always were. It\u2019s in there now. But even as you wrote, in one place about being a kid, \u201CRemember being a kid? We danced with all we have. We wore Superman outfits to the grocery store. As children we are closer in time to the Creator.\u201D Did you have thoughts like that too, when you were a child? I think so. I think I realized who I connected with, and I connected with my grandparents. And I think we were in the same light. I was in the dawn and they were in the twilight, but we were in the same light. And because of that, they\u2019re heading to the Creator, and I\u2019m coming from the Creator. And it seemed, because of that, we spoke a very similar language. And I wondered, even as I was getting older, and as I looked back, where that goes, because it does go. We become really entrenched in this world, and then as time goes on, and we come into the nearer of \u2014 the end of our lives, we go back to that point. And this time we\u2019re headed \u2014 now we have the names for it. Before, we had the visceral feeling of the Creator, but now we have the names, and we know what to call it. You mean as we move through life, as we become adults? And I think you\u2019re also the first person I\u2019ve heard about who seems to have a genetic predisposition for getting hit by lightning, which does have its dramatic religious overtones, as well. Yeah. Everybody \u2014 well, I used to tell the story that every male in my family got hit by lightning. But my mom took one through the TV, and the first thing she \u2026 She did? Yeah, and she called me up and said, \u201CI knew it wasn\u2019t just from your father\u2019s side.\u201D That\u2019s the first thing she said. Or is it maybe infectious, that she got it? I don\u2019t know. There is actually a physiological reason that \u2014 lightning does look for the easiest path to the earth. And so as it\u2019s coming down, if you\u2019re the easiest path, it will take you. And I think, and even my brother and I, in shop class, in junior high, they had this test where they put a wire in, and it measured your conductivity, the amount of moisture in your skin. And my brother and I are the two to put the needle in the red. And so we must have a lot of something, moisture in us, or something. You\u2019re a conductor. We\u2019re somehow \u2014 yeah. So, you mentioned your arm, and you also have the unusual experience of knowing about, as you\u2019ve said, disability you are born with and disability you acquire later in life, and the difference between those two experiences. And it\u2019s always been kind of a tool for you, in a way, as a child, and then as a humorist also, right? It is. It\u2019s a really \u2014 you\u2019re always looking, especially as a storyteller, a way into finding a point of trust with your audience, or with who you\u2019re with. And having something as obvious as my arm was always a good point to start the trust. Some people compare storytelling and stand-up. \u201CWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201D we\u2019re often asked. And the difference to me is that stand-up is aiming \u2014 they close the door with a joke. A storyteller, we really open the door with a joke. And so humor is, again, a way to establish a trust, because when you laugh at the same thing, it means you come from the same place. It\u2019s a point of recognition. One thing that\u2019s also, as a kid that really paid off, was when people see something different, they immediately have assumptions. And you can either feed into those assumptions or take them away from those assumptions. And the choice is yours. Mm-hmm. I love the way you break up the word \u201Cdisability.\u201D Oh, yeah. Especially that, the \u201Cdis-\u201D in \u201Cdisability.\u201D Yeah. That\u2019s a really a long topic that starts with \u201Cdis-\u201D. I remember, when you read Dante, he goes to \u201CDis,\u201D it\u2019s the underworld. I think there\u2019s quite a connection between the underworld and having a disability, because, as Dante puts it, \u201CDis\u201D is the underworld, the it is the place of shadow and reflection where you round off the rough edges of torment and desire. You go to this world of Dis. And it\u2019s the prefix for \u201Cdisability,\u201D which doesn\u2019t mean un-ability, it means \u201Cable through the world of shadow and reflection.\u201D And so it\u2019s just another way of doing things. But it is through that way, and it is literally having a foot in two worlds. Especially, after my motorcycle accident \u2014 there was a guy in Minneapolis who saw the accident, and he thought I died. And he went around telling all \u2026 Right, I think the news came out that you had died because of his eyewitness account. And he believed it so strongly that even when it turned out I hadn\u2019t died, he still believed it. And I see him on the bus every once in awhile, and he thinks I\u2019m a ghost. Really? And he looks right through me. Yeah, I\u2019ll talk to him and he\u2019ll just stare right through me, because he thinks I\u2019m sent to haunt Minneapolis. Well, he\u2019s not entirely wrong. I kind of still feel like I can\u2019t extricate a foot from that world that I think that he\u2019s got a point. For the rest of my life, I will have a foot in another world. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with storyteller and humorist Kevin Kling. In addition to his plays and comedy routines and poetry, he\u2019s published several collections of his stories. The Dog Says How was his first book after the accident that utterly changed him. I do want to read that first page \u2026 The Dog Says How? The Dog Says How. I should probably tell people why it\u2019s called that. Well, yeah, why is it called that? Well, because when I got in my accident, I had to get voice-activated software, which is great, because you speak into a microphone and then it writes what you say. But part of the problem is, it \u2014 that\u2019s when I found I had an accident, because it\u2019s got to learn your nuances. You didn\u2019t know before? No, I didn\u2019t, and it\u2019s like when the movie Fargo came out. Remember that? And people from here kept calling the radio station and went, \u201CHey, what\u2019s the deal? We don\u2019t sound like that.\u201D I mean, oh, brother. So, I\u2019m reading into the microphone, I think the Gettysburg Address. And as I\u2019m \u2014 because it already knows what I\u2019m saying, and it can pick up my nuances, and then from then on know how to write what I\u2019m saying. Well, my dog and cat got in a fight behind me, and the dog\u2019s like, \u201CRooo, rooo, rooo,\u201D and the cat, \u201CMeow, meow.\u201D \u201CRoo, roo, roo.\u201D \u201CMeow, meow.\u201D And the computer started writing, \u201CHow, how, how, why, why, how, how, how?\u201D The dog\u2019s looking at the cat, like, \u201CHow?\u201D And the cat\u2019s like, \u201CWhy? Why are you doing this?\u201D So great. And that\u2019s where The Dog Says How came from. Yeah. So I\u2019m going to ask you to read some stuff later, but I actually want to read this, and it\u2019s very beautiful. It\u2019s kind of like the preface, you would say, on a motorbike. I just want to read the first lines. \u201CIt all started because I wanted to fly. I remember watching the barn swallows on my grandparents\u2019 farm, fork-tailed acrobats of the sky, darting in and out of rafters, following roads only they could see, living life just ahead of their bodies. God, I wanted to feel that, a foot in two worlds, so I got a motorcycle.\u201D Which ends with you flying off the motorcycle. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the last line is, \u201Cand from my body I flew.\u201D So, it was a different kind of flight than I\u2019d planned on. Right. And seems to me that as you write now, it feels like \u2014 maybe this is true for all of us at various times in our life, that something happens and it reframes everything that comes after. But also, because you \u2014 it\u2019s a very dramatic happening, and also because I think you\u2019re somebody who, again, is always going back and forth in time, and connecting dots between childhood stories, and the stories of other parts of your life, it\u2019s almost like the accident also reframes the stories you tell about the beginnings of your life. It really did. When something like that happens \u2014 part of another thing I try to describe in a poem that I wrote is that when you are born with loss, you grow from it. But when you experience a loss later in life, you grow toward it, that you are now \u2014 have become a person you aren\u2019t yet. You\u2019re still the old person, and you have to grow into that person that you were. And so, for me, going back into childhood and finding out where the pieces that fit with this new person belong is, again, part of the journey. I have to go back and reframe my childhood to fit with this new person that I am, not the person I was. And so that\u2019s part of that exploration. What did you see, then, in your childhood that you hadn\u2019t paid as much attention to before? I think mostly human connections. This is when I\u2019m \u2014 part of it is when this accident happened, because I do believe you spend the first half of your life running away from home and the second half trying to get back to home. And when I had my accident was at a pivotal point. I was still running away from home. I had my accident, and then this journey back to home coinciding with this person that now is searching back through these people, I\u2019ve started to embrace people I used to run from, my parents and my grandparents, understanding them on another level, understanding the choices that they made at times that really either upset me or I didn\u2019t understand. Now going back and reliving those times through a point of connection. And before that, my stories really involved adventure and travel. Again, that running from. And this has really created a different form of retrospect. And again, it\u2019s person-driven. Right. It\u2019s true. There are lots of stories about your brother, also, and even childhood escape where you may be staying in the same place, but you\u2019ve created universes that you go to. Yeah, it\u2019s a different world now. And it seems when you write about that, it was really a near-death experience, in a sense, right? You felt like you could have gone either way. It did. At that point, where I can only assume is the point of impact, was a\u00A0\u2014 given a choice to follow a great sense of peace, or to return to this plane. And I returned, and one of the struggles I will always face is, \u201CWhy did I return? Why did I choose tension over peace?\u201D And, obviously, it was a choice. I remember you had a quote on one of your shows, where Rabbi Heschel said, \u201CWhen we pray, don\u2019t pray to get things, pray to be worthy to get things.\u201D And that\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer as time goes on. Talk some more about that, because that\u2019s also a theme that I feel like \u2014 your whole sense of prayer, what it means, what it does, that has completely shifted. It has. One of the stories that I tell is about the three phases of prayer, the first being pray to get things. I prayed as a kid. Especially \u2014 there was a squirrel monkey in the back of Spiderman comics. It was for $9.99. And I wanted that squirrel monkey so bad. So I remember around Christmas time, I\u2019d pray to God to ask Jesus to tell Santa to get me that monkey. And then it shifted to prayers in college to get me out of things, and, you know, save me. \u201CI\u2019m in over my head here.\u201D And the story I link to that is when I was on the island of Ios in the Mediterranean, and I wanted to get back to Athens, but I reached in my pocket and I only had $20, and I still wanted to see Italy and Ireland. So I stowed away on a boat. And, the guy next to me, a French guy said, \u201CThey haven\u2019t even come around for tickets, and when they find you, they\u2019re going take you below,\u201D he said. \u201CThis happened to a buddy of mine. They\u2019ll beat you with socks full of soap because they won\u2019t show bruises.\u201D And I said, \u201CWell I\u2019m an American, no they won\u2019t.\u201D \u201COh, God, they\u2019re going love you,\u201D he said. So when they came up I hid behind these barrel depth-charge things and they saw my shoes and I climbed over a ladder and I\u2019m hanging over the water and I prayed \u2014 I bet I hadn\u2019t prayed in ten years \u2014 and I prayed, \u201CGet me out of here, please God, I won\u2019t ever do anything this stupid.\u201D And then the third phase of prayer, I was in rehab, in the hospital, and while I was in rehab, 9/11 happened. And I watched it on TV and I didn\u2019t think it was \u2014 I thought it was another TV show. And I saw 9/11, and then after that, I had post-traumatic stress. And I was in sync with the country. We all were going through post-traumatic stress at the same time. It was, like, going from denial to anger to vengeance. And I had to take an elevator down to the bottom floor every day and try to walk half a block. That was, like, my job. And I\u2019d walked my half a block, and that\u2019s when Mary, my wife, Mary, met me in the lobby, and she bought an apple for me. And I hadn\u2019t, food had no taste. So I was losing a lot of weight. And she said, \u201CJust take a bite, just for me.\u201D So I took a bite, and flavor, that was the day it came back, and the sweetness came in, and when the sweetness hit my tongue, it, I started to cry, and it was flushing out all of the antibiotics and toxins that I had. Again, I hadn\u2019t cried in years. And my eyes were burning, and with my burning eyes and the sweetness in my mouth, it just felt good to be alive. And I just remember thinking, thank you, thank you, thank you that I lived. And that my prayers shifted to thanks. And then I couldn\u2019t tell whether, after that, good things were happening because I was saying \u201Cthank you\u201D or they just \u2014 I was noticing them. But there is blessings in my curses, even today. Every day. I think you\u2019ve written about \u2014 crying more easily is just an effect that\u2019s now a part of your life in a way that wasn\u2019t before the accident. Is that right? Yeah, it is. Tears come much easier. And it is, it\u2019s the way we flush out our toxins. It\u2019s the way we \u2014 there\u2019s a lot to tears, the salt in them, it\u2019s just \u2014 they do a lot for us. I was wondering, as I was reading that, have you ever heard that Eastern Orthodox Christianity has a notion of the \u201Cgift of tears\u201D? That it\u2019s like a charism, a grace, a gift? It is. Do you know how good you feel after a cry? It\u2019s like an inward sauna. Something happens that comes out. And you just feel really refreshed after a good cry. I try in the stories or shows that I do, in a good evening, there will be as much crying as laughing, because I think both have such healing qualities. But it really gets trained out of us, right? Especially out of men, maybe. I think it does. That\u2019s like a clich\u00E9, but \u2026 Well, no, it\u2019s, but it\u2019s true. I have a son and I see that he, even from a young age, he got this idea that crying is something he stops himself from. That\u2019s why we have sports movies. I tell you, get him in \u2014 I tell you, Bad News Bears still gets the waterworks going in me. Don\u2019t worry, you will get him in front of a sports movie, he\u2019ll lose it, yeah. All right. Thank you for that. Something else you said about one of the gifts after the accident is, \u201CNothing is boring any more.\u201D Is that still true? Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t think it ever was boring. I was always pretty entertained. We grew up, but we grew up in that time when moms would go in the grocery store and leave you in the car. They might crack a window. And you look over and \u2026 Boredom was the only element you had to work with. It was. But you\u2019d look over in the car next to you, there\u2019s another kid looking over at you. That\u2019s the way we did things. And I remember being on my grandparents\u2019 farm and we called it \u201Cunstructured time.\u201D But it was boredom. We had unstructured time, which was great, because then we got to invent, we got to create our worlds. And I always credit \u2014 that is why I\u2019ve never been bored since. I do say I\u2019ve been to plays where I wished I was somewhere else, and somewhere I would have fallen asleep if I hadn\u2019t been the one talking. But I haven\u2019t been bored. I want to talk some more about storytelling, and what you know about the power of stories. One way you talked about \u2014 it feels like you made this choice to come back to be alive, even if you didn\u2019t \u2014 and then that it was a choice, even if you\u2019re not sure \u2014 the question mark for you is, why did you decide? But that you\u2019ve written about that, as you\u2019ve had a chance to rework your ending of your story. Here\u2019s something else you said about the power of stories: \u201CWhen I turn something into a story, it doesn\u2019t control me anymore.\u201D Right. Now, I can take you the long way through this, or the short way. Well, do, and I\u2019ll tell you why. I think this is so important because storytelling comes up in so many of my different conversations. And I think about it a lot because it\u2019s my bread and butter. Right, but it\u2019s the element of meaning-making it always has been for human beings. It is. But in the latter half of the 20th century, I think, when you and I were being born, we were \u2014 we got very technical and systematic, and felt like we would be able to discover everything, and have the systems to make things work, and facts were powerful, but it\u2019s not, it was never the whole story, it was never the whole story of being human. But with every discovery, a million more mysteries come up. The mysteries never stop. And the ambiguity gets greater. We live in this time where it\u2019s harder to follow a light. It\u2019s more important to find solace in the mystery. I think that that\u2019s what storytelling is about. But I want to get back to, at some point, storytelling and healing, because something happened very recently to me that has changed everything. And I want to get back to that, but I got to get to that. I tell about why I tell stories by telling a story. And it starts with \u2014 my neighbor Ben is at my house, and we\u2019re turning a glass door into a screen door. And by doing this, we\u2019re putting the glass door over a garbage can. And I\u2019d given him a ball-peen hammer, and he\u2019s smashing the panes out. And then I\u2019m going to put mesh in it and make it a screen door. And so he\u2019s nine years old, and he\u2019s smashing out this glass. And all of a sudden he stops, and he goes, \u201CAre there jobs like this?\u201D And I go, \u201CYeah, I got one.\u201D And that\u2019s how I think about my job. And meanwhile, his brother is running up and down in front of the house. He\u2019s got a towel wrapped around his neck, his arms are out in front of him, and he\u2019s going \u2014 he\u2019s three years old, John Griling. And he\u2019s going, \u201CI\u2019m Batman, the animated version!\u201D And I go, \u201CHey, John, get in the house.\u201D And he comes in, and he always draws me a picture on our dining room table. And on this day he draws a circle, for the first time, he drew a circle. And he runs out the door with this thing and he comes back the next day, it\u2019s all wrinkled. I could tell he slept on it. And he put in eyes and a mouth and he drew his first face. And it was somebody he could tell what to do. And that was a big day for him. Now, he had control over things. Somebody he knew or he didn\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t matter. But that\u2019s exactly how I use stories. By telling a story, things don\u2019t control me anymore. It\u2019s in my vernacular. It\u2019s the way I see the world. And I think that\u2019s why our stories ask our questions, our big questions, like, where do we come from before life, after life? what\u2019s funny in this world, or sacred? And even more importantly, by the asking in front of people, and with people, even if we don\u2019t find the answer, by the asking, we know we\u2019re not alone. And I have found that often that\u2019s even more important than the answer. So it\u2019s that idea of belonging, and we are social beings. That idea of a comfort in the mystery, and that\u2019s where stories \u2014 I\u2019ve got a buddy up in La Couderay, and he says that \u2014 he\u2019s a medicine man. He said, \u201CYou can survive anything with sense of humor and sense of self.\u201D And our stories give us both of those. Laughter is the same thing. When you\u2019re laughing at something, it can\u2019t control you. You can listen again and share this conversation with Kevin Kling through our website, onbeing.org. There, you can also watch behind-the-scenes video of my entire conversation with him, and find audio of Kevin Kling performing and reading his stories. This is from an NPR commentary he did called \u201CThe How and Why of Life and Death.\u201D I think when it comes to the underworld, most people are either dogs or they\u2019re cats. It\u2019s either how, or why. For me the underworld is like a good haircut, that it probably falls between something I had and something I wanted. But we just don\u2019t know. We do know whenever you take a trip, there\u2019s the trip you planned and then there\u2019s the trip you take. Time was, only a select few got to visit the underworld, like Odysseus, Orpheus, Dante, Nixon. Now, anyone with enough money can go to hell. When I had my accident, I got a glimpse of things to come. And I\u2019ve grown used to the fact that I do have a foot now in two worlds. Look, we all have things that haunt us. Ghosts, things that we can\u2019t find a home for, that go bump in our hearts and minds. We call them names like sins, or regrets, or desires. And they seem to fall into two categories, kind of like Kentucky Fried Chicken, they\u2019re either original or extra spicy. OK, original ones are the ones we get before birth, little tiny time bombs lurking in our genetic weed bed, just waiting to spring into acts of passion or illness. We can\u2019t do anything about those. We don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re there. They\u2019re like that tae kwon do school in a shopping mall. Why\u2019s that there? It just is. Then there\u2019s the haunts that we create by losses or choices made in life, and they tend to trouble us even more. And our great fear is that they will follow us into the afterlife. Ever since my accident, I don\u2019t fear death. I get a sense of peace to think I\u2019ll see my ancestors, friends that I\u2019ve lost, my dad, my first dog, and my arm. But until then, it\u2019s, \u201CHow, how, why, why, why?\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today I\u2019m with storyteller and humorist Kevin Kling. He experiences himself as living, as he puts it, \u201Cstraddling two worlds \u2014 physically and even spiritually.\u201D He was born with a misshapen left arm much shorter than his right. And then in his 40s, a motorcycle accident nearly killed him and took away the use of that right arm. So Kevin Kling lives with both disability and wholeness. He\u2019s faced the possibility of death and made the choice, he felt, to live. You said a minute ago that you had a story about stories and healing, or something you\u2019ve learned just recently. Yeah. This has become my new \u2014 this is my struggle these days. After my motorcycle accident, I had post-traumatic stress. And I couldn\u2019t sleep, I had anger issues. It really had changed me as a person. Can I just say, also, that you\u2019re so delightful, and you\u2019re so funny, and I think it\u2019s really good to hear that part of it, too. Oh, boy. You know what I mean? Because you can speak so eloquently about what you learned and the gift of it and the grace of it and, but you\u2019ve won all that. It was hard-won, right? It was wrested out of dark places. It still is, and this part of the struggle, this exactly \u2014 because all of a sudden, all of those buffers that went \u2014 anger, I could go straight to it. And I work in a theater company of performers with disabilities, and \u2026 I want to talk about that later. Oh, good, because I\u2019ve learned so much from them. And one of the things is about anger. It is a tool, and it can get things done. But to me, it\u2019s like pain. It\u2019s not the answer. It\u2019s an indicator that something\u2019s wrong. And you can\u2019t find the answer through the anger, you can just know something\u2019s not right. That\u2019s helpful. Anyway, with this post-traumatic stress, a few months ago, after years and years, it came back with a vengeance. And I went to a therapist and she said, \u201CYou got to understand this isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s not time, really, it doesn\u2019t work. It sits in such a deep place that it\u2019s not triggered in ways you would think. It\u2019s not something that time heals. It will come back.\u201D And so what she had me do, which fit just with my weird, Jungian sensibility \u2014 she had me tell the story of my motorcycle accident. It was a bit more complicated than this. She told me the story, but instead of hitting the car, I missed the car, and I went to where I was going. And by retelling the story and having a different outcome, I started sleeping better. All of a sudden, the post-traumatic stress really dissipated in a significant way. And it was because I retold the story in another way that had me survive in another way. Now the struggle with me is, I still wake up in the morning with my arm not working, with all these things. So there\u2019s a reality, and then there\u2019s another story I\u2019ve created. And it really seems to fit with the way we work as humans, especially these days. We need to rewrite our stories sometimes just so we can sleep at night. But it\u2019s not the reality. We can\u2019t live in the story that makes us sleep, but we need it to sleep. And so that\u2019s my struggle now, putting those two together, taking the myths we form to make ourselves feel better and fitting it with the reality that we live in. So something you talk about \u2014 that there\u2019s a difference between healing and curing. Oh, a big difference. And it seems connected to me. It\u2019s related to what you\u2019re saying, that there are ways in which we need to heal, which are not going to be about everything being all right. No, and anyone that\u2019s ever had their heart broken knows exactly that. The heart is an instrument, once broken, never repairs the same. Yet, even though it can\u2019t be cured, it can be healed, and you can love again. But that heart isn\u2019t the same heart that was broken the first time. And any time you experience loss \u2014 whenever I use the word \u201Ctrauma\u201D in my work \u2014 the word \u201Closs\u201D I usually replace as often as I can, because a loss is a loss, whether it\u2019s a heart, a limb, a promise, a person. It\u2019s all loss, and it\u2019s all trauma, and it\u2019s all things that are broken that can\u2019t be cured. You can\u2019t go back. But you can heal it, and that\u2019s an important thing to know. I see, also, aging is incremental loss. It is. Here\u2019s one of your lines: \u201CIf you are able-bodied, it\u2019s only a temporary condition.\u201D Which is to say that everything you\u2019re describing that you learned through disability, disability inborn or acquired, is it\u2019s kind of an expanded version of something that, in fact, is very mundane. It is; it\u2019s what happens to everybody. We all experience loss. And it\u2019s part of being human. It\u2019s part of our experience. And it\u2019s not something you necessarily cherish. To me, I associate it with being an artist. Nobody\u2019s an artist on purpose. It\u2019s something that happens to you, and then you create from there. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019re a person and you experience these losses, it\u2019s what gives us our richness. But it\u2019s hard. It gives us our wisdom. Yeah. Wisdom\u2019s not cheap. We pay for it. Right. So this conundrum of needing the stories that can help us sleep at night, but knowing that \u2014 what are you saying? That it can\u2019t, in fact, be defining? That you\u2019re going to have to still move beyond that story? Yeah. I think this is, again, living in a world of ambiguity, living in these these worlds of paradoxes. Part of me, now that I see that and recognize that, now I\u2019m all excited about it. Now, it\u2019s something I get to\u2026 You get to use it. \u2026figure out. Exactly, I get to talk about in front of people. And slowly \u2014 that one is one that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever bridge. I think, now, I\u2019ve got a lifetime of work that I can\u2019t wait to explore. And it really is the essence of storytelling, of what we do, of theology, is that connection of myth with reality. And the need for both of them. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, with storyteller and humorist Kevin Kling. In his 2011 play Joice Rejoice, he experimented with ideas about the boundary between life and death. It\u2019s a playful and poetic retelling of the biblical story of Lazarus, where Jesus responds to the plea of Lazarus\u2019 sisters and brings him back to life after he\u2019s already been dead for four days. Kevin Kling is also passionate about his involvement with Interact \u2014 a theater and visual arts group composed largely of people with varying disabilities. So tell me about Interact. I just, I feel so fortunate to be part of it. Oh, boy, I could tell so many stories. But one recently that really keeps recurring \u2014 one my friends, Ingrid, she has aphasia. And aphasia is a condition, it\u2019s difficult for thoughts to become words. And Ingrid said one time, before her aphasia, she used to feel, \u201CI think, therefore, I am.\u201D But, now, she knows we come from deeper place. Now she feels, \u201CI am, therefore, I think.\u201D And when she told me that, that has come back time and time again, when I remember \u2014 at that point of that accident, when you think of being down the middle \u2014 with the past, they say, when you dwell in the past, it\u2019s regrets. When you dwell on the future, it\u2019s anxiety. How do you find that middle road, that sensual middle road? And when you can ride that, the things that fall away \u2014 when the symbols fall, the myths fall, the words fall. And you get to that point right before the emotion of the experience, you really are at a point, \u201CI am, therefore, I think.\u201D But you can\u2019t hold it. But you know it\u2019s there. You know what I mean? Yes, and somehow that not being able to hold it is also part of that human condition. It is. It\u2019s the beauty of it. It\u2019s like love, or truth, or beauty. It\u2019s those things that can\u2019t be held. It\u2019s those things that we keep trying to get back. It\u2019s that idea of recreating. If we\u2019re created in God\u2019s image, if we are creations, then we, too, are creators. And the thing that I love about the idea of God, then, is that, you know, as a creator, your creations continue to surprise you. As we draw to a close, more theology that I find in you. You compared yourself to Lazarus, right? Oh, yeah. After you came back from the dead when you flew off your motorcycle. Yeah. The story of Lazarus, that\u2019s one I just touched on. I did a play that \u2014 the character of Lazarus and his connection with Jesus. And I loved his sisters. One was supposed to be Mary Magdalene, and the other sister, Martha, who was so mad at Jesus because he left him down there for four days. Right. And she\u2019s like, \u201CBring him back.\u201D And just that, we don\u2019t get, through the Bible, what Lazarus went through, and where he was, what that \u2014 four days. So I wanted to explore that in this play about, what happened on each day? When did he run into the rich man that was left behind? What did the rich man give him? What were his first days like of getting used to living in this world that was devoid of sensual nature? When we talk about living and riding that line, it really is living the senses, living the five senses. When you are living them, then you are the most awake that you will be. There\u2019s a lot of, in that play \u2014 it was just full of the Bible. It really was a biblical play. Have you worked with the Bible in that way? Is that new? It is new for me. Post-accident new? Mm-hmm. It took me a long time because I grew up \u2014 the Bible was really difficult because there was so many people telling me what was in it. I forgot that \u2014 I learned through fairy tales. I learned that when you retell a fairy tale, you can tell it the way you want to tell it. You can tell a story the way \u2014 what touches you in the story. Even Jesus has four different versions. And so even \u2014 there\u2019s markers for that. And I never liked fairy tales because the guy with the disability always got the short end of the deal, and the other \u2026 So who\u2019s that? Who would be the guy with \u2026 Well, like the seven dwarves, Snow White trades in seven good ones for one \u2014 perfectly good little ones for one big one. And the ugly duckling. OK, this one was a particular thorn for me. Because, the ugly duckling, it\u2019s all going great when he\u2019s this large, uber-duck. I love that, this big duck. But then they find out he\u2019s a swan. And so all of a sudden, he\u2019s not a duck anymore. He\u2019s a swan. Well, when you\u2019re a kid with a disability, what does that do? You hope a ship of aliens lands and goes, \u201CNo, you\u2019re really one of us.\u201D But you\u2019re stuck living with ducks. And so, when I learned you could tell them the way you saw them through your own eyes, and that fairy tales were meant to be told, and told to get your point of view across, then I got to change them around and thicken them up. And then, with the Bible, sticking to it, but there\u2019s clues and hints and things inside the Bible that really relate to what I\u2019m going through. In a way, also \u2014 and not just in the Bible, but in the heart of religious tradition, there\u2019s so much of that \u201Cthank you for being alive\u201D that you discovered\u2026 Oh, man, David, yeah. \u2026after your accident, and that\u2019s also kind of lost in a lot of the way religion came down to us in childhood. It\u2019s with that create-and-recreate, it\u2019s the joice, rejoice. It\u2019s remembering that joy, that original joy, recreating, rejoice. And, yeah. That\u2019s the key. Yeah, there\u2019s a line that you wrote about identifying with Lazarus, you said: \u201CI wish I was so certain. I have doubt, I have doubt. But there is freedom in that, instead of a path, I\u2019m finding solace in the mystery.\u201D And you\u2019ve said that, also, that mystery is so important. And then I was really struck by this little essay, \u201CRacing Towards Solace,\u201D in The Dog Says How. And there was a little \u2014 you tell a story. It\u2019s right near the end. \u201CBack in the days when pots and pans could talk\u2026\u201D Oh, yeah! It\u2019s not like I read this and I know exactly what it means, but I feel like it somehow it expresses a lot of the essence of you. It\u2019s a very simple thing. But I wondered if you would read that? Sure. I might \u2014 should I do that \u201CTickle\u201D \u2014 we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 should I do \u201CTickled Pink\u201D? I love this, \u201CTickled Pink.\u201D So if you wanted to read that, I think it\u2019s amazing. Yeah, that\u2019s one that\u2019s kind of \u2014 I end a lot of shows with that one. So the \u2026 \u201CBack in the days when pots,\u201D just that \u2026 \u201CBack in the days when pots and pans could talk, which indeed they still do, there lived a man. And in order to have water, every day he had to walk down the hill and fill two pots and walk them home. One day, it was discovered one of the pots had a crack, and as time went on, the crack widened. Finally, the pot turned to the man and said, \u2018You know, every day you take me to the river, and by the time you get home, half of the water\u2019s leaked out. Please replace me with a better pot.\u2019 And the man said, \u2018You don\u2019t understand. As you spill, you water the wild flowers by the side of the path.\u201D And sure enough, on the side of the path where the cracked pot was carried, beautiful flowers grew, while other side was barren. \u2018I think I\u2019ll keep you,\u2019 said the man.\u201D Somehow that felt like just a picture of living with disability, living with loss as a human being. Mm-hmm. I think that \u2014 well, the story says it, but I think it is looking at \u2014 especially living on the fringe, and, again, being recognized for what we bring, not for what we aren\u2019t. And it is that world of the \u201Cdis-\u201D of disability. It\u2019s that other foot. I would love it if you want to read \u201CTickled Pink,\u201D which is just beautiful. Tell me where this came from? This came from \u2014 I did a show. I work with a group called \u201CBad Jazz.\u201D And it\u2019s three guys that \u2014 we aren\u2019t \u2014 I kind of plateaued in the junior high, as far as playing tuba, but I still love to do it. And so, this was a song that I wrote, and it\u2019s based on \u2014 the story is based on, when you were feeling your best, my mom would say, \u201CYou\u2019re in the pink,\u201D which meant that your insides were pink. And so this poem is called \u201CTickled Pink\u201D: \u201CAt times in our pink innocence, we lie fallow, composting, waiting to grow. And other times we rush headlong like so many of our ancestors. But rush headlong or lie fallow, it doesn\u2019t matter. One day you\u2019ll round a corner, your path is shifted. In a blink, something is missing. It\u2019s stolen, misplaced, it\u2019s gone. Your heart, a memory, a limb, a promise, a person. An innocence is gone, and now your journey has changed. Your path, as though channeled through a spectrum, is refracted, and has left you pointed in a new direction. Some won\u2019t approve. Some will want the other you. And some will cry that you\u2019ve left it all. But what has happened has happened, and cannot be undone. We pay for our laughter. We pay to weep. Knowledge is not cheap. To survive we must return to our senses, touch, taste, smell, sight, sound. We must let our spirit guide us, our spirit that lives in breath. With each breath we inhale, we exhale. We inspire, we expire. Every breath has a possibility of a laugh, a cry, a story, a song. Every conversation is an exchange of spirit, the words flowing bitter or sweet over the tongue. Every scar is a monument to a battle survived. Now when you\u2019re born into loss, you grow from it. But when you experience loss later in life, you grow toward it. A slow move to an embrace, an embrace that leaves you holding tight the beauty wrapped in the grotesque, an embrace that becomes a dance, a new dance, a dance of pink.\u201D Kevin Kling is a performer and an advisory council member of Interact.
