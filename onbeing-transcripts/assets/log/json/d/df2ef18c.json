  "fullText": "I first learned about the organizational psychologist Adam Grant in a New York Times Magazine piece that described his prodigious success that is only matched by a legendary generosity to colleagues, strangers, and especially his students. His extensive and innovative studies show that most of us can find meaning in any kind of work when we perceive ourselves to be of service \u2014 whether we realize this is our motivation or not. And he is wise about making what he calls \u201Cmicroloans of our knowledge, our skills, our connections to other people\u201D in a way that can be transformative for us and others, and our workplaces. Adam Grant has more than a few subversive perceptions for all of us to apply \u2014 unsettling old notions that only the greedy rise to the top. This tendency to look for ways to improve the lives of others, to want to help others, and enjoy that without expecting anything in return \u2014 which I think is at the heart of being a giver \u2014 is actually something that does not have to compromise your professional success. Just as you wouldn\u2019t worry that you\u2019re going to be a bad parent if you\u2019re generous. Or you\u2019re going to be a terrible community member if you care about the people who live near you. You can also be an extraordinarily successful professional if you demonstrate concern for the people that you work with. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Adam Grant is the youngest tenured and highest-rated professor at the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania. And he\u2019s consulted for numerous organizations including Google, the United Nations, and the U.S. Army. He became known to many through his popular book, Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success. You know, it\u2019s interesting because this passion you have for giving and helping and service \u2014 all of these things are associated, I think, with spiritual traditions at their best. I\u2019m just \u2014 tell me, how do you trace the beginnings of those passions and curiosities in your life? Well, I think I had some amazing role models who were extremely generous, and in ways that I never would have expected. So growing up, my grandmother once drove two and a half hours through a snowstorm so that my mom could go exercise. And my grandmother lived, like, five miles away. So this is a fairly unusual effort. And, you know, I remember at the time being really touched by it. And she was always at our house making great meals for us, and, I guess my grandparents on both sides were very, very heavily involved in our lives. And I just thought grandparents were the coolest thing ever, because the whole role was about giving. Yeah. And I remember \u2014 I think this is something we all experience when we receive unexpected and meaningful gifts \u2014 we want to pay it back, but there\u2019s really nothing you can do to pay it back. So the next best thing is to pay it forward. And I guess that happened to me a lot as a kid. And then in high school, I was a diver, the springboard kind, not the scuba kind. And I had very little talent. I walked like Frankenstein, I could hardly jump or even touch my toes. And I had this incredible coach, Eric Best, who said, \u201CYeah, that\u2019s the bad news. But the good news is diving is a nerd sport, and it attracts all the people who are too slow for track, and too short for basketball, and too weak for football. So if you put in a lot of energy, you could become pretty good at this.\u201D And that really lit a fire under me, but what was remarkable about Eric was we only had diving season from November through March. And he took countless hours out of his spring, summer, and early fall to coach me, just volunteering. And he said, \u201CAs a coach, I will put in whatever you put in.\u201D And he didn\u2019t get any compensation for it. He really loved diving and he really took joy in helping his divers grow, personally as well as athletically. And, you know, that was really a life-changing experience for me. I ended up getting good enough that I qualified for the Junior Olympic Nationals twice, and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026ended up going to dive at the NCAA level in college. And, I guess I just began to believe the world would be a better place if we could bring out that quality in those around us. Abraham Lincoln called it \u201Cthe better angels of our nature.\u201D Yes. Yes. And I think we all have better angels, but that oftentimes, the way we\u2019ve lived our lives, it doesn\u2019t necessarily bring them out. Right. And you\u2019ve ended up working a lot with people in organizations and with organizations and how they work with people. I think that\u2019s also a sphere of our public life where there\u2019s always a lot of reasonable cynicism. Right? I mean, even these days we have new models of business which turn out as they mature to look like old models of business with much cooler perks. But I see you really working against that cynical edge. And one of the things you\u2019ve talked about, and that your book is about \u2014 that you\u2019ve coined this language of givers and matchers and takers. And I want to talk about matchers and takers a little later on. But I want to first talk about givers. So tell me how you start talking about this personality type \u2014 or this, I don\u2019t know, you wouldn\u2019t call it a personality type, would you? What would you call it? I would call it a style of interacting with others or\u2026 OK. \u2026or maybe a value or a motivation. Yeah. I think that it\u2019s actually challenging, because it seems like the workplace is the last place we should ever talk about generosity. Yeah. And that\u2019s exactly why \u2014 it\u2019s part of the reason why I think we need it there. That\u2019s a very fraught place to talk about it. It is. It\u2019s\u2026 Yeah. \u2026it\u2019s difficult. And I will be the first to tell you, I\u2019m extremely skeptical of the motivations of leaders and of the reasons that drive a lot of business decisions. Yeah. But what\u2019s fascinating to me about this topic is that most of us spend the majority of our waking hours at work. Yeah. Right. If you even believe in the slightest \u2026 This is where we spend our lives. It is, right? Mm-hmm. I do. You do, right? Yeah. So Krista, if you buy the idea that generosity is a core value in life \u2014 the data are actually pretty strong that it may be the core value in life, but we don\u2019t even have to go that far. We can just say it\u2019s one of the most important values that people hold dear. It\u2019s a little bit of a tragedy to leave that out of the place where they spend the majority of their hours. Yeah. And what I\u2019ve encountered over and over again in my career, both with students and with the executives I\u2019ve worked with, is they often feel like they have to check those values at the office door. Yeah. And I think that\u2019s a mistake. And I guess what I set out to reveal was that this tendency to look for ways to improve the lives of others, to want to help others, and enjoy that without expecting anything in return \u2014 which I think is at the heart of being a giver \u2014 is actually something that does not have to compromise your professional success. Yeah. Just as you wouldn\u2019t worry that you\u2019re going to be a bad parent if you\u2019re generous. Or you\u2019re going to be a terrible community member if you care about the people who live near you. Mm-hmm. Right? You can also be an extraordinarily successful professional if you demonstrate concern for the people that you work with. Right so \u2026 And that I think is the story here. Yeah. Or part of the story. And one of the things that you have demonstrated in your research is that givers are over-represented among the people who are least successful. And I \u2014 by certain measures that we use. They can be people who burn out and stay behind while other people get ahead for various reasons. But, they are also over-represented at the other end of that spectrum of people who, by certain metrics, we qualify as successful. That\u2019s right. I think that was one of the biggest surprises here, is that people who are generous were the most likely to fail big and succeed big. Mm. And that always begs the question, what\u2019s the difference between the failed and successful givers? Yeah. Yeah. And I\u2019ve gotten a lot clearer about this since I wrote Give and Take. I think that it fundamentally comes down to the choices we make every day about who we help, when we help, and how we help. So the \u201Cwho\u201D is, I think, pretty simple. Failed givers are the people who help anyone. Successful givers are much more likely to be thoughtful about what is this person\u2019s history and reputation like? Before I go and overextend myself and give you 17 hours, I might want to find out if you\u2019re likely to take advantage of me. Yeah. And exercise just a little bit of caution or self-protection there. The \u201Cwhen\u201D is basically about protecting time to make sure that you achieve your own goals. One of the mistakes that failed givers make is they drop everything for any request that comes in. Right. Right. And what you see with successful givers is they\u2019re much more likely to prioritize and say, \u201COK, I\u2019ve got these windows blocked out to make sure I can progress on my own tasks.\u201D Mm. \u201CAnd then I have other periods of time set aside to try to be helpful and responsive to others.\u201D So there is a balance between the concern you have for others and the concern you have for yourself, the value with which you also hold yourself. There has to be. Mm-hmm. If there\u2019s not, you\u2019re at much higher risk for burnout. You\u2019re also at greater risk for being exploited. Yeah. And it\u2019s just like on an airplane, right? You have to secure your oxygen masks before assisting others. And the irony is, if you look at 30-plus years of data on this, the people who are the most selfless, the most altruistic, actually give less than the people who balance concern for others with concern for self. Give less measured how? What does that mean? Every metric you can measure \u2014 money, time, skills, connections. If you are selfless to the point of self-sacrifice, at some point you run out of energy and resources\u2026 Mm. \u2026to be able to able to contribute to others. Mm. Whereas people who are able to work toward their own goals, or at least keep their own interests in the rear view mirror when they\u2019re helping others, are able to sustain their energy and their resources. And that allows them to give much more over time. A couple of other things that I really find interesting in the way you talk about this. One is, you say \u2014 and this is why I kind of corrected myself when I said a personality type. You say we \u2014 you believe that we all have the giving muscle, but some of us exercise it more. That\u2019s a great way to capture it. And yeah, some of us feel those impulses more often. Some of us express them more often. But it\u2019s very true that we all have moments of giving and generosity where we\u2019re just focused on how we can make somebody else\u2019s life a little bit better. And it also turns out to be the case that if you exercise that muscle, it gets stronger. Mm-hmm. As people practice helping others, they start to notice what other people need. And when you notice what other people need, it\u2019s hard not to want to help them. Another thing that I found really interesting is that this giver profile \u2014 that these people, it doesn\u2019t necessarily correspond to outer veneer, like, who would come to mind as the most cheerful and nice, in terms of presence and affect. This is also a surprise to me. Yeah. I tended to associate agreeableness with generosity. Yeah. So the agreeable people are the nice, friendly, welcoming, polite \u2014 and I just assumed if you\u2019re nice to somebody that means you care about them. But there\u2019s this whole class of people who would actually score in the data as disagreeable givers. They might be gruff and tough on the surface. They\u2019re skeptical, critical, and challenging. But at the end of the day, they have other people\u2019s best interests at heart. And they\u2019re actually, in my experience, the most undervalued people in our lives. Mm. Because if you\u2019re a disagreeable giver, you\u2019re the person who gives the critical feedback that nobody wants to hear, but everyone needs to hear. Right? You\u2019re playing devil\u2019s advocate, you\u2019re asking tough questions, you\u2019re challenging\u2026 Yeah. \u2026the status quo, and we need to appreciate those people much more in our lives than we currently do. This one is so interesting because on the surface it\u2019s a little surprising. Then the minute you start thinking about it you think of those people who, as you say, might be gruff or stern in a way that makes you rise to the occasion, but who also have huge hearts. And you always know that. And you\u2019re right, they\u2019re kind of these bedrock people. They are. And there was a software engineer at Google who had a great way of describing them. He said, \u201COh, a disagreeable giver is somebody who has a really bad user interface, but a great operating system.\u201D Right. I thought that was endearing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with organizational psychologist and Give and Take author, Adam Grant. Yeah. Another thing you talk about that\u2019s \u2014 I just have to say, I find very refreshing \u2014 is you have found that we tend to think that what we are looking for as human beings, as professional people in particular, is work that is interesting that leads to advancement. You say that a sense of being of service to others is, on balance, a greater motivator than those things, and actually makes people more productive. You know, this is one of those things that\u2019s pretty hard to make a case for on its face. Right? Mm-hmm. We think that people are fundamentally selfish. And that\u2019s the value you ought to appeal to if you want to motivate people. And yet, look at all the things that people would never do for themselves that they constantly do for others. Whether it\u2019s something as simple as a boring task where you persist, because you really care about the client who might benefit from it, whether it\u2019s all of the hours you might spend in the car driving your kids from place to place that you just wouldn\u2019t have bothered if it was only for you. Working in a job that\u2019s extremely difficult to sustain, because it\u2019s physically taxing, it\u2019s exhausting, it\u2019s degrading, because you\u2019re trying to provide for your family. But these are all things that people struggle immensely to do for themselves, but they readily do for others. And when I studied this, it was with fundraising callers who were doing a pretty\u2026 Yeah. \u2026unpleasant task. Yeah. A call center\u2026 Trying to make \u2026 \u2026right? Exactly. Yeah. They\u2019re calling alums of universities and trying to get them to donate their hard-earned money. And when they were told about all the benefits of doing the job for themselves, it didn\u2019t affect their motivation at all. But when they realized that they were actually providing scholarships to help students go to school, their efforts dramatically spiked. So in one case, just hearing from a scholarship student for five minutes about how that scholarship made a difference was enough to boost weekly time on the phone by about 142 percent per caller, and 171 percent weekly revenue. And then we found that could get even bigger \u2014 that if you got a scholarship student in who really deeply appreciated the work that the callers were doing, the average caller spiked more than four times greater money raised per week than before. But something else so interesting in the way you describe that study is that the call center employees, while all these \u2014 this productivity went up as you describe \u2014 the effect of that demonstration of the service they were providing was more unconscious than conscious, right? I mean, they didn\u2019t walk away saying, \u201COh, I understand how I\u2019m helping, and now I\u2019m going to do better.\u201D It was more something that just touched them at a granular level. Yeah, this was not what I anticipated going in. I had the data. It was a bunch of randomized controlled experiments. I had how the callers were doing before and afterward. I was comparing them to different control groups. And it was very clear that it was this experience of hearing from and meeting a scholarship student that boosted their motivation. And yet, when they filled out surveys, they didn\u2019t attribute any of the changes in their motivation to that experience whatsoever. And I think it was very hard \u2014 it\u2019s hard for any of us to say, \u201CYeah, I just had this five minute interaction with a random person, and now I work twice as hard as I did before.\u201D Right? Most people don\u2019t believe that small encounters can have that kind of large impact. Yeah. Yeah. And yet, the data show otherwise. I mean, you also had this example of doctors and nurses at \u2014 just at a hand station where people are supposed to use soap or hand sanitizer. The difference between the sign reading \u201CHand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases,\u201D and the sign reading \u201CHand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases,\u201D and that the latter actually motivates people to wash their hands, in a different way. That was a lot of fun. Dave Hofmann and I ended up doing this study after I was in the hospital with my wife when we were expecting our first child. And there were all these signs plastered around that said, \u201CGel in, wash out.\u201D Yeah. And you know, as an organizational psychologist, I just looked at those signs and said, \u201CThis is not a how-to problem. People know how to wash their hands. It\u2019s a why-to problem. They need a reason to do it.\u201D And the medical safety experts were all convinced that you have to just remind people, doctors and nurses especially, that this could affect them. And so we tested the signs. They were identical, we just changed the word from \u201Cyou\u201D to \u201Cpatients.\u201D And only the patient sign worked. It led more soap and gel to be used. You measured the soap, right? I didn\u2019t personally, but there\u2019s an environmental services team that actually weighed the soap and gel dispensers. Right. Based on the signs. But there were also \u2014 there were professionals on each unit doing covert observations of whether you washed according to guidelines before and after patient contact. Mm. And we got about a ten percent spike in frequency when it said \u201Cpatients,\u201D but not when it said \u201Cyou.\u201D Right. And, one thing that people say of you, and I think \u2014 a huge reason that your work has such credibility is because you really are someone who \u2014 you practice what you preach. I first read about you in that New York Times Magazine piece, 2013. Oh, dear. Yeah, you probably \u2014 I can imagine that that was, I mean \u2014 you were kind of put under the microscope for that, I think. But you know, here\u2019s one of the lines. \u201CFor Grant, helping is not the enemy of productivity, a time-sapping diversion from the actual work at hand. It is the mother lode, the motivator that spurs increased productivity and creativity\u201D \u2014 for you first, and then as you go out in the world, as you find, in other people. There\u2019s this one line, \u201Chelpfulness is Grant\u2019s credo.\u201D And I just \u2014 how would you \u2014 obviously these are something, these are things somebody wrote about you. But what does that mean, and how does that credo break down into practical actions in the course of an ordinary day? Well, I guess, if you look at the evidence on this, the thing people want most in a job is a sense of meaning and purpose. They want to know what they do matters. And that\u2019s been true for literally generations across the American workforce. And you find similar things in other parts of the world. We want to contribute to others. That\u2019s the biggest source of meaningfulness. And so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that that\u2019s something that I, and many others, find motivating. And yet we don\u2019t have great narratives about \u2014 \u201CI really love helping others, and that\u2019s the reason that I work so hard.\u201D Yeah. Right? That\u2019s not a modest thing to say. I guess, for me, I really enjoy being helpful when I can. I think it helps me feel that what I\u2019m doing does make a difference, and that I\u2019ve made choices that have value to others, not just to me. And as a professor, the two things that I love most are trying to share knowledge, and make introductions. And there are few things more exciting than when somebody poses a question like, \u201CHas anybody ever studied\u2026?\u201D and then, you know, brings in a problem that has to do with work or psychology, which are my core areas of expertise. And I happen to know of a study that actually speaks directly to it, and provides a novel solution. But also, here\u2019s what I think is really interesting about this, too. Clearly you\u2019re passionate about the work you do, the actual research you do, and the teaching, the subject matter, the knowledge that you transmit. And that\u2019s part of the service aspect of your work. But a lot of this helping is about things that happen, you might say, around the edges of that work. It\u2019s the human connective tissue, not just around the work, but in the place where you are with students and other professors and colleagues and clients. I think even that is interesting in helping other people stretch their imaginations about what it means to kind of go through your days, including your working days, as a giver. Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s not just a linear, narrow thing about the precise tasks you are performing and being paid for. Do you know what I mean? I do. Although Krista, I think that\u2019s an overly gracious description. The way I see it is, my core job is research and teaching. But you can\u2019t do either of those things without building meaningful relationships with extraordinary people. Mm-hmm. And every day, there are \u2014 I guess, opportunities you stumble into, where \u2014 and this, to me, is the hallmark of trying to live your life as a giver, where you can do something that benefits other people more than it costs you. Mm. And that just seems efficient, right? Aside from the fact that it seems like the right thing to do, it\u2019s like, OK, it\u2019s not a core part of your job description, but the benefit to others is so much greater than the cost to you. How could you not do it? Yeah. I think \u2014 and I just want to kind of draw you out on this \u2014 I\u2019ve been talking about this a lot with people lately, how the notion of meaningful work is getting decoupled from just your job title or the organization you work for. I mean, what you\u2019re talking about \u2014 you are researching that. But you\u2019re also talking about just how you are present, how a person is present, as a human being in all the relationships that surround and weave through whatever work we do. And that that also is service. I think that\u2019s where a lot of people derive actually the greatest meaning from their work. One of the most inspiring bodies of research on this for me has been by two great colleagues, Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane Dutton. And they studied this idea of job crafting, which is saying, \u201CLook, instead of being a passive recipient of my job, I\u2019m going to become an active architect of it, and shape it to better align with my skills, interests, and values.\u201D And they basically make the point that your job wasn\u2019t, in most cases, designed for you. It was designed for a whole bunch of people to perform it in a consistent way. And there\u2019s a lot you can do to customize it on the margin to make it more ideal, but still realistic. And they studied this in so many interesting places. They\u2019ve done studies with hospital cleaners, who adjust their jobs to create opportunities to care for patients and make their families feel more welcome in the hospital when everybody\u2019s overlooking that and just focusing on the medical parts of care. And if you look at the job-crafting actions that people find most meaningful, the adjustments they make every day to their jobs, they\u2019re not just tasks, they\u2019re relationships. Yeah. It\u2019s saying, there\u2019s some people that I would really love to make a closer connection with, and I\u2019m going to propose a side project with them. Or I\u2019m going to structure my day so I get to spend a little bit more time interacting with them. Or, what\u2019s amazing is how many people choose to craft their jobs in ways that help others. And it\u2019s amazing that when given the freedom to do this kind of job-crafting and adjust their jobs in any way they want, people choose, naturally, in so many cases, to make modifications that benefit others, not just themselves. You can listen again and share this conversation with Adam Grant through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a conversation with the organizational psychologist and author Adam Grant. He passionately studies and practices generosity in organizational life \u2014 what he calls \u201Cmicroloans of time and talent.\u201D He discerns when and how these can become transformative for people and the cultures of all kinds of workplaces. In his book Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success, Adam Grant describes three basic orientations of which we are all capable, and which influence whether organizations are joyful or toxic for human beings \u2014 the givers, the takers, and the matchers. You also talk about just the value of small favors. And I think you were just pointing at that. The person who you can easily give a connection to. But you talk about \u2014 that making introductions can be acts of giving and you\u2019ve also talked about things like knowledge-sharing, mentoring, helping, providing feedback. Some place, in another interview, you said \u201CSometimes it\u2019s as simple as showing up early or staying a bit late to support your colleagues.\u201D I think all of that kind of flesh-on-the-bones of this is really useful. I think that people are really narrow typically in how they think about giving. Yeah. Most of us think about giving time and giving money. We don\u2019t think as much about how we can make microloans of our knowledge, our skills, our connections, to other people. Yeah. And what\u2019s interesting about this \u2014 the person who, I think, captured this best is Adam Rifkin, who, as you know, is a serial entrepreneur in the Bay Area. And Adam has coined this idea of a five-minute favor and has basically spent the last two decades of his career saying, \u201CLook, a five-minute favor is just a small act that could add large value to other people\u2019s lives.\u201D And we could all afford to do a few more five-minute favors each week. And you should be willing to do five minutes for anyone, right, because it\u2019s just such a small investment that could be meaningful. And what I love about that is that it\u2019s a great reminder for, if you already are a giver, saying, \u201CLook, I do not have to spend 42 hours with every person who asks.\u201D Right. But if you\u2019re hoping to shift in the giving direction, it\u2019s a really nice way to start, to say, \u201CLook, yeah, a lot of acts of giving sound exhausting, and I\u2019m worried about over-extending myself, but I could do a few five-minute favors this week. Sure.\u201D I want to ask you one other thing that you talk about \u2014 consolidating giving yields greater happiness. What is that act of consolidating? What does that look like? Well, there are actually two kinds of consolidating. So one is the timing. Sonja Lyubomirsky led this terrific study where you\u2019re randomly assigned to do five random acts of kindness per week. And you\u2019re either asked to do them one per day each week, so you do one Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, et cetera. Or you do all five of those acts in one day each week. So you pick Tuesday as your giving day, and you knock out all five contributions that day. You do that every week for ten weeks. So I think I called them sprinkling if you spread them out, and chunking if you put them all together in one day. And whenever I poll people about this, about 80 percent of the audience thinks that the sprinklers are going to get happier, that a little bit of giving each day is good for your mood. And Sonja found the opposite, that only the chunkers, only the people who do all their giving in one day per week get any boost in their mood whatsoever. And that \u2014 really surprising \u2026 How do you understand that? What\u2019s that about? Well, I was going to turn this back around to you. I mean, you have won a National Humanities medal. You do a lot for other people. How would you explain this? Well, that\u2019s not what \u2014 I\u2019m the person asking the questions here. I\u2019m in charge. [laughs] OK, this is the mark of a giver. Only asking other people questions. OK. No, but what would you say? How would you account for that? Gosh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really interesting. I feel like I\u2019m on the spot here. I don\u2019t want to give the wrong answer. Is \u2026 No the great thing\u2026 I wonder if this\u2026 \u2026is there isn\u2019t a wrong answer. Yeah. Is the sprinkling \u2014 if the sprinkling is just another way to disperse. I mean if it becomes more intentional, that you\u2019ve somehow \u2014 that you\u2019ve more intentionally built it into your time. I don\u2019t know. So, I\u2019m glad I asked, because that explanation has not been really considered, to my knowledge, yet. So this is a really fun example of a study that we\u2019ve seen this effect of chunking as beneficial, but we don\u2019t really know why. So I think the idea that becomes more intentional if you do it all in one day is really compelling. Mm. And it\u2019s related, actually, to one of the explanations that\u2019s been popular so far, which is the idea that if you do it sort of a little bit each day, you sprinkle it out, it\u2019s just \u2014 it becomes another chore on your to-do list. Yeah. Right. Whereas if you do it all in one day, this is now a meaningful contribution and it becomes more than just a drop in the bucket. You feel like you made a difference today. But I do think it goes against the grain of what most people do as far as giving is concerned. Yeah. And there\u2019s a case to be made for saying, maybe you should have a giving Thursday. And try to line up a bunch of a contributions in that day each week. It\u2019s something to look forward to, and it\u2019s also a chance to know that you\u2019ve got other days reserved to be productive or get your own things done. Well, I think for a lot of people that also might feel like it takes some of the shine off. You know what I mean? If you institutionalize it and maybe that\u2019s wrong. Maybe that\u2019s a wrong instinct. Well, I don\u2019t think it has to go so far as institutionalized, right? It\u2019s not necessarily just about time. It\u2019s also about how you give. So you could ask, are you a generalist or a specialist in the way that you help others? Mm. And most people prefer the generalist approach. Whereas if you specialize in one or two forms of giving that you enjoy and excel at, then people respect that you have unique expertise to share. They actually come to you for what you like to give, which makes it more energizing than exhausting. And I think we can probably all do a better job stepping back and asking, \u201CWhat are those one or two forms of giving that I get excited to do, that I do uniquely well, and how do I focus on those and let other people carry some of the others?\u201D That\u2019s great. So givers inhabit the world together with what you call takers and matchers. As you say, this makes sense to me. Matchers follow the norm. So if they\u2019re in the presence of givers \u2014 so givers and takers have impact because the tone they set, or the presence they set, will be matched. I mean, it is sobering, and I think again, we\u2019ve all had this experience and I \u2014 tell me if this is correct. I think what you say is that it\u2019s possible for one taker to dominate and ruin an organization or an experience. It takes more givers \u2014 it\u2019s not possible for givers to redeem the whole in the same \u2014 in quite the same way. Yeah. The way I like to put it is that one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg does not make a dozen. Yeah. But it does \u2014 when you study this in teams, for example, one really selfish taker is enough to leave everybody else paranoid, making sure that they don\u2019t get taken advantage of, and can really depress the generosity of a whole group. Whereas, you put one generous person in the group, and more often, people are like, \u201CGreat, you can do all my work,\u201D instead of saying, \u201CI\u2019m now inspired to give, too.\u201D And I think we have to be very careful about that bad-is-stronger-than-good effect, because it is possible that takers can really pollute a culture or a community. So, is this one factor in why organizations are such tricky things? And especially big organizations, and as organization grow that you can have an organization full of wonderful, creative people, but you can have a culture that is toxic for those people, which they survive rather than, rather than flourishing in. Sadly, I think that\u2019s a big part of the story. Mm-hmm. A lot of takers are skilled at kissing up and kicking down. Yeah. And they manage to convince leaders that they\u2019re actually givers as part of their rise up the ladder. And then a lot of people think that power corrupts, but I think, if you look at the evidence on this, it\u2019s more likely that power reveals \u2014 in the sense that if you\u2019re a taker, you don\u2019t have to pretend to be a giver once you\u2019ve gained a lot of status and influence. Now you have the freedom to express your values. And so I think what happens is takers often rise by being fakers, and then you get to see their true colors once they\u2019re in a top leadership position. We should probably do a quick definition. I mean, how would you talk about this orientation of being a taker? Well, I think of takers as people whose default is to try to get rather than give. So their goal is to come out ahead in every interaction. They want to claim work that\u2019s interesting, visible, and important, leave the grunt responsibilities for everyone else, and they tend to feel entitled to the lion\u2019s share of resources and credit. Even when they didn\u2019t do the majority of the work. You\u2019ve said that the question of how to turn takers into givers is, for you, one of the thorniest, kind of, unanswered questions you have. Is that still true? Did I say that? Somewhere, yeah. Yes, then I totally endorse it. No, it\u2019s a huge problem. I think the good news is that very few people are takers in every walk of life. Mm-hmm. You do have sociopaths who are more likely to adopt that orientation in all their relationships, but for most people, think of, like, the biggest selfish jerk that you work with. And then, you know, watch that person drive their kids to soccer practice. Yeah. There\u2019s certain roles and relationships that bring out the givers in us, and I think that if we can observe the variations in people\u2019s behavior, and understand what brings that out? What are the moments when they act more generous? We can try to tilt them, but that is not always a simple thing to do. You have two daughters, is that right? Two daughters? I do. Yeah. And a son. Oh, and a son. Congratulations. Thank you. One reason I think this is so helpful \u2014 the way you talk about being of service, being a giver, is it\u2019s very integrated, it\u2019s woven into the things you\u2019re already doing. I mean, I know you\u2019re talking about the potential, I think, everybody has to find ways to do this in the course of their days. I think especially when we think of service activities, and giving back \u2014 when we think of that as outside our usual day, especially when you become a parent, you just feel like you have a finite amount of energy and maybe more of that energy goes into that relationship. Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s certainly how I feel. Mm-hmm. And I always want to give to my family first and foremost. I think that we overlook, though, when we just stop there, the notion that in fact there are lots of ways to give that involve children and parenting. Yeah. So I think that it\u2019s extremely important for children to see their parents giving, and not just giving to them, where they can take it for granted, but to see them helping other people. That\u2019s actually part of how children learn values associated with generosity. Mm. Is they see their parents doing things for other people. And one of the ways that I\u2019ve \u2014 in small \u2014 in a very small sense that I\u2019ve tried to bring that to light is, I brought our oldest daughter to review sessions that I do for students before final exams. It\u2019s an optional session where I show up and try to answer any questions students have so that they\u2019ve really internalized the material, and they feel prepared. But, also I \u2014 as I think about that, I think, yeah, I want her to know that it\u2019s important to me not just when I talk about it, but when she sees me do it\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026to give to my students. I mean, you reiterate something I\u2019ve heard from many different directions, from all kinds of people who think about parenting and children and what we nurture in children. And this is very frustrating thing that children don\u2019t learn by listening. They learn by observing. If only, right? Yeah. But I wondered, you \u2014 when you were talking about your grandmother when we first began to speak, I was actually speaking with a psychologist recently \u2014 not on air, but just a person I knew \u2014 who talked about the fact that as we grow older, and I\u2019m in my 50s, so I think I\u2019m moving there. That you become more embodied as you grow older, or you become more settled in yourself. And that one reason maybe children are so drawn to grandparents and impressed by them is because they experience that fullness of presence. I mean, because, really, what \u2014 again, you were talking about your grandmother having this generosity of spirit, but it was just completely rooted \u2014 I mean, it was who she was, and it was what she did, and those things worked together. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s somehow It occurred to me that this fact that children learn by observing, that this may be one reason grandparents make such an impression. But that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s fascinating. \u2026off the top of my\u2026 I never thought about that\u2026 \u2026head. \u2026before. I love it. It actually strikes me as really compelling. There\u2019s a colleague of mine, Sue Ashford, who studies the self. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence that, especially through teenage and college years \u2014 but even as people move into their 20s and 30s \u2014 that there\u2019s a lot of instability in self-esteem. That people feel like they have worth only if they accomplish a certain thing\u2026 Mm-hmm. \u2026or achieve a certain goal. And self-esteem is sort of staked in being able to prove yourself in different activities and domains. And as people get older, what Sue has observed, is they develop more of a sort of a calm, secure sense of self that\u2019s not dependent on, how did today go? Yeah. Like\u2026 Yeah. \u2026I\u2019m still a person of value, even if I had a really bad day. Yeah, because you just have a longer arc of experience, right? You just know\u2026 Exactly. \u2026because you\u2019ve been there before. You know that today leads to tomorrow. I think there\u2019s so much to be said for that, and it may also help to explain there\u2019s so much evidence suggesting that the elderly are the most generous among us. Mm-hmm. That when you look at proportions of income, when you look at time volunteering, when you look at how willing they are to stop and help someone who\u2019s in need \u2014 basically, every decade you age, your odds of being generous go up and up. Oh. And I think that\u2019s a big part of it. There\u2019s this sense of secure self, but there\u2019s also this sort of greater desire to give back. Part of it is worrying about this horrible generation that\u2019s coming up into the world. Yeah. \u201CThey really need some help!\u201D \u2014 But I think that people become much more clear about the value that they can add and they don\u2019t doubt themselves nearly as much as they age. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today with organizational psychologist Adam Grant. You\u2019ve been writing recently about friendship at work. And how fewer Americans now than 30 years ago will say that they have a close friend at work, and fewer Americans say this than people in other countries. I think it\u2019s unfortunate, both from a happiness standpoint, because the evidence is overwhelming that people are more satisfied in jobs where they can make friends. And you wrote, \u201CWhether we bond at work is a personal decision, but it may involve less effort and vulnerability than we realize.\u201D Yeah, this is from one of my mentors, Jane Dutton, who studies high-quality connections in the workplace and finds that you don\u2019t have to have a long-standing relationship to experience a genuine sense of connection. That even just a single interaction marked by mutual respect and trust is enough to energize both people. And I think if we thought about having more high-quality connections, more moments where we just treat each other with respect and trust, and we open up a little bit, it actually becomes the foundation for having meaningful interactions, even if we don\u2019t call somebody a lifelong friend. And, interestingly, you say that, in terms of how a workplace would generate this, is not about, like, having mixers, or having special events, but meals, which is so obvious. I have to say, we moved our show into an independent production two years ago, and I think one of the most \u2014 I mean, we have a wonderful, open, hospitable space, but we have a kitchen table, right? And that the fact that some combination of us have lunch together every day. I cannot imagine this workplace without that. And I\u2019ve never been in a workplace that had that before. But it\u2019s so obvious, isn\u2019t it? I mean [laughs] we know as human beings that relationships happen around meals. It\u2019s such a good example of a knowing-doing gap, where we all have this understanding in our heads, but we rarely put it into practice. As you say, in all the rest of our lives, we know that that is where we gather and make a connection. And yet this place where we spend so much of our lives, we\u2019ve separated it out. OK. This is so fun. So, you also are a magician and I don\u2019t want to end here without asking how all of that intersects with all of this \u2014 all of these things we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 what you do, your passion. Oh. I\u2019m not sure it does, but if I had to try to draw a connection, I would say that one of the things that really sort of brought me to magic as a kid was I loved being surprised and entertained and seeing something that I thought was impossible look possible. And I think that a lot of the teaching and research I\u2019ve tried to do since captured some of that element of surprise. That people think that generosity is a disadvantage, but it can also be an advantage. And also, my hope is, in teaching and sharing insights, to try to entertain people a little bit along the way. And I guess I tried to \u2014 as one of my mentors suggested, unleash a little bit of that inner magician in the classroom, which is great fun. Hopefully for not just me, but the students and audiences as well. So, one of the ways you give is that you draw attention to other people\u2019s work. You have a voice on some great platforms, and you use that. And, I was noticing, I guess this was a blog, was it, something, your website \u2014 you do, kind of, round-ups of research that other people have done that you think is interesting. Things that are fueling your imagination and your emerging questions. And in one of your round-ups, I think it was your round-up for 2014, there was some research about a question that is a good question to ask people. Which is \u201Cwhat did you enjoy doing at age 10?\u201D Do you know what I\u2019m talking about, this research? Yeah, keep going. Yeah. So, that \u201Csometimes by looking back into the past you\u201D \u2014 and this is psychological research \u2014 \u201Cyou can get a glimpse of who you really are and what you loved before others started telling you what you should do.\u201D And so here\u2019s what I thought I would ask you. In the that New York Times piece in 2013, I mean, it did talk about you as being socially awkward, shy, introverted, didn\u2019t like parties. Still don\u2019t like parties. But go on. OK. But, so, here\u2019s what I wanted to ask. What have you learned, through all this work you\u2019ve done, what have you learned about what it means to be human that would have delighted the you, the Adam Grant, at age 10? Oh, what a wonderful question. I think I probably would have been delighted to find out that the core of our humanity is stepping above and beyond our own narrow needs and concerns and goals. And I guess what would have surprised my 10-year-old self is that, in the long run, the people who bring out that concern for others, who exercise that muscle of generosity regularly, actually achieve the greatest success in the long run, and also find the richest meaning in happiness. That would have probably pleased me and startled me a little bit, too. One of the things that comes through in what\u2019s written about you is this volume of your commitments. Your helpfulness to the point that would feel exhausting. It was, honestly, kind of exhausting for me to read about. Noble. I\u2019m so sorry. Noble, but exhausting. I wonder as you \u2014 you now have three children \u2014 as you get older, I mean, you\u2019re also \u2014 you\u2019re this very young tenured professor, but as you \u2014 as you get older do you find yourself shifting that energy and are you learning things about boundaries that you perhaps didn\u2019t deal with in your early 20s? Oh, yes. I think one of the lessons and effects of the New York Timesstory was it\u2019s not necessarily a useful thing in your life to have an international newspaper tell random strangers that you like being helpful. OK. I got thousands of emails from people\u2026 Oh, my gosh. \u2026asking for the most bizarre variety of things that I wasn\u2019t qualified to offer. And it really \u2014 as I guess, you know, it was easy to say yes to everything when I was only visible inside an ivory tower. Mm-hmm. And once my work became more salient to people, I started getting more requests and it was just more than I could handle individually. And I think what I learned to do was prioritize who I wanted to help. So it\u2019s family first, students second, colleagues third, everybody else fourth. Mm-hmm. And friends fall somewhere in there, too, although they\u2019re \u2014 that\u2019s usually just like a conversation, right? Friends are less often asking for help, so I don\u2019t know where to put them in the hierarchy. But, now when I get a request, I will ask, is this going to compromise my ability to be there for my family, and to deliver on my commitments to my students? Mm. And it also means that there\u2019s some colleagues who probably have more negative views of my concern for others than my students do. And yeah, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to become comfortable living with, to say, I didn\u2019t become a professor to inspire other professors. OK. I became a professor because I wanted to make a difference in the lives of students, and that\u2019s the group that matters most to me professionally. And so when my time is conflicted or scarce, I will always prioritize students first and foremost, professionally. And that\u2019s been a really valuable experience to go through. And I think that\u2019s a really helpful kind of template \u2014 you know, guideline, for how other people in other configurations can create those boundaries for themselves. I hope so. At minimum, it\u2019s just a realization that you can\u2019t be equally giving to everyone. And so, when you are going to face trade-offs, it\u2019s useful to know what your priorities and principles are.
