  "fullText": "People sometimes ask me if there\u2019s a defining quality of the wisest people I\u2019ve interviewed. Thich Nhat Hanh \u2014 the Vietnamese Zen master who Martin Luther King nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 embodies my answer as well as anyone. It\u2019s an engaged, paradoxical merger of power and gentleness. And I interviewed Thich Nhat Hanh in the early 2000s at a retreat he was leading attended by police officers and other members of the criminal justice system. What I heard and experienced there has come back to mind with urgency in these weeks of conflict in the world. You know, as a police officer, you\u2019re so often a victim and so often an oppressor. You really have to come to grips with both of those. And I started to understand that it\u2019s possible to bring this into your work as a cop, because as my energy started to change, the energy that I got back from other people started to change, even including the people that I had to arrest. As he\u2019s able to be peaceful, and graceful, and kind in the midst of the suffering he experienced without denying the suffering, I think that\u2019s a perfect model, pathway, through the African-American experience into the full human experience. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Thich Nhat Hanh first came to the world\u2019s attention in the 1960s during the war in his native Vietnam. He forsook monastic isolation to care for the victims of that war and to work for reconciliation among all the warring parties. He called this \u201Cengaged Buddhism.\u201D And in 1969, Thich Nhat Hanh led the Buddhist delegation to the Paris Peace Talks. He was expelled from post-war Vietnam because he had refused to take sides even as he worked for peace. He settled in exile in France. And there, he founded Plum Village, a Buddhist community, or sangha, that has spawned communities of practice and service around the world. His students call him \u201CThay,\u201D the Vietnamese word for teacher. In recent years, Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s counsel has been sought by CEOs at the World Economic Forum, Harvard Medical School faculty, even members of the United States Congress. I met Thich Nhat Hanh at a lakeside retreat in Wisconsin attended by some 500 people of many backgrounds and professions. Each day included teaching, rest, and seated and walking meditation, with a morning gathering in a sunlit auditorium. When he teaches, Thich Nhat Hanh speaks to the conflict and bewilderment of contemporary life directly, it seems, having developed his practices through years of chaos and bloodshed in his own life. He wrote his classic book, The Miracle of Mindfulness, as a manual for young nuns and monks who were facing death every day in war-torn Vietnam. As you listen to my conversation with him, you may find his Vietnamese-French accent a little difficult to follow at first. I found myself leaning in close as he began to speak about the animating Buddhist virtue of mindfulness. What have you done with this concept that is different? I mean, how did you interpret it or apply it differently that it had such an impact? Mindfulness is \u2014 when you are mindful, you are fully alive. You are fully present. You can get in touch with the wonders of life that can nourish you and heal you. And you are stronger. You are more solid in order to handle the suffering inside of you and around you. When you are mindful, you can recognize, embrace, and handle the pain, the sorrow in you and around you to bring you relief. And if you continue with concentration and insight, you\u2019ll be able to transform the suffering inside and help transform the suffering around you. And this word \u201Cmiracle,\u201D on the surface, is quite intriguing when what you\u2019re describing is so organic. I mean, it\u2019s getting in touch with your breath, first of all. Does that word or does this phrase \u201Cthe miracle of mindfulness,\u201D does that come out of your Buddhist training or was that a phrase that came to you? It is in my heart when I use it because, when you breathe in, your mind comes back to your body. And then you become fully aware that you\u2019re alive, that you are a miracle and everything you touch could be a miracle \u2014 the orange in your hand, the blue sky, the face of a child. Everything becomes a wonder. And, in fact, they are wonders of life that are available in the here and the now. And you need to breathe mindfully in and out in order to be fully present and to get in touch with all these things. And that is a miracle because you understand the nature of the suffering, you know that all of suffering, that suffering play in life, and you are not trying to run away from suffering anymore, and you know how to make use of suffering in order to build peace and happiness. It\u2019s like growing lotus flowers. You cannot grow lotus flowers on marble. You have to grow them on the mud. Without mud, you cannot have a lotus flower. Without suffering, you have no ways in order to learn how to be understanding and compassionate. That\u2019s why my definition of the kingdom of God is not a place where suffering is not, where there is no suffering\u2026 The kingdom of God? Yeah, because I could not like to go to a place where there is no suffering. I could not like to send my children to a place where there is no suffering because, in such a place, they have no way to learn how to be understanding and compassionate. And the kingdom of God is a place where there is understanding and compassion, and, therefore, suffering should exist. That\u2019s quite different from some religious perspectives which would say that the kingdom of God is a place where we\u2019ve transcended suffering or moved beyond it. Yes. And suffering and happiness, they are both organic, like a flower and garbage. If the flower is on her way to become a piece of garbage, the garbage can be on her way to becoming a flower. Right. That is why you are not afraid of garbage. I think we have suffered a lot during the 20th century. We have created a lot of garbage. There was a lot of violence and hatred and separation. And we have not handled \u2014 we don\u2019t know how to handle the garbage that we have created. And then we would have a sense to create a new century for peace. That is why now is very important for us to learn how to transform the garbage we have created into flowers. Vietnamese Zen master and poet Thich Nhat Hanh. He\u2019s known for his concept of \u201Cbeing peace,\u201D assuming a compassionate, peaceful presence with tangible effect on the world. I look at the violence that marked the world in the period when you were a young monk. There was the Cold War. There was a certain kind of violence and hostility. A lot of that has changed, has gone away, a lot of the terrible threats and the sources of the worst fighting. And now, in its place, we have new kinds of wars and new kinds of enemies. I\u2019d be really interested in, as you look at this period of your lifetime, is there any qualitative difference between the violence that we have now and the violence that we had then? Is there anything like progress happening, or is it the same pattern that repeats itself? Yeah, you are right. It\u2019s the same pattern that repeats itself. And does that make you despair? No, because I notice that there are people who are capable of understanding that we have enough enlightenment, and if only they come together and offer their light and show us new way, there is a chance for transformation and healing. In a retreat like this, you\u2019ve gathered around you hundreds of people who are offering themselves up as individuals to this kind of training and mindfulness. And you\u2019re not just talking about peace here, there\u2019s a sense of peace. But then the cynical question would be \u2014 can these individuals make a difference? It seems like we live in an age of collective violence, collective terror, and collective acts of retribution. How do you see the effect of this work that you do? Well, peace always begins with yourself as an individual, and, as an individual, you might help building a community of peace. That\u2019s what we try to do. And when the community of a few hundred people knows the practice of peace and brotherhood, and then you can become the refuge for many others who come to you and profit from the practice of peace and brotherhood. And then they will join you, and the community get larger and larger all the time. And the practice of peace and brotherhood will be offered to many other people. That is what is going on. And you experienced that to be\u2026 Yes, because when I came to the West, I was all alone. And I was aware that I had to build a community. And there was no Buddhists at all at that time. So I work with numerous people, and I suggest the practice of mindful breathing, mindful walking, mindful sitting. And slowly it built a community practice. We even have communities in the Middle East consisting of Israelis and Palestinians. Right. I know that you\u2019re bringing Israelis and Palestinians together at Plum Village. Yes. Is your teaching any different if you\u2019re speaking to members of Congress, or you\u2019re speaking to Hollywood filmmakers, or you\u2019re speaking to law enforcement officers? The practice would be the same. But we need friends to show us how a certain group of people lead their life or what kind of suffering and difficulties they encounter in their life, so that we can understand. And after that, only after that, we could offer the appropriate teaching and practice. That is why we continue to learn every day with our practice and sharing. In a collection of diary entries from the 1960s, published with the title Fragrant Palm Leaves, Thich Nhat Hanh wrote, \u201CIf you tarnish your perceptions by holding on to suffering that isn\u2019t really there, you create even greater misunderstanding. One-sided perceptions like these create our world of suffering. We are like an artist who is frightened by his own drawing of a ghost. Our creations become real to us and even haunt us.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with a radio pilgrimage with Thich Nhat Hanh, exploring his practice of mindfulness in a world of violence. We\u2019re at a retreat center in eastern Wisconsin. For the first time at such a gathering, more than 50 people who work in the criminal justice system are here, about half of them police officers. A police captain from Madison, Wisconsin, Cheri Maples, helped make this possible. She first encountered Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s teachings in the early \u201990s and wondered if she could incorporate such ideas into police work. He surprised her by insisting that there is such a thing as a fierce bodhisattva \u2014 bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition being a person who has reached enlightenment and chooses to stay on Earth to serve others. Now Cheri Maples calls Thich Nhat Hanh \u201CThay\u201D or teacher. But on her first retreat with him, as a person who carries a gun for a living, she balked at his most basic principles. Well, as a cop, what started to happen to me there got very interesting because \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you attended the five mindfulness trainings, but that was one of the things that happened at my first retreat. And I just assumed, \u201CWell, I\u2019d listen to this, but I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a cop. I mean, I might be in a position where I have to kill somebody at some point. I can\u2019t think about taking these.\u201D And Sister Chan Khong, who is one of the \u2014 probably the senior monastic here, was at that retreat, and she pulled me aside and she had this very wonderful conversation with me, the essence of it being, \u201CWho else would we want to carry a gun except somebody who will do it mindfully? Of course you can take these trainings.\u201D And what happened to me is my heart started to soften and kind of break open for the first time. I had gotten very mechanical about how I was doing my job. I had no idea that I had shut down that way. And I came home and, especially that first week when it was so new and everything felt so fresh, I started to understand that, on a very, very deep level, that it\u2019s possible to bring this into your work as a cop because, as my energy started to change, the energy that I got back from other people started to change, even including the people that I had to arrest and take to jail. But probably the first example of that was \u2014 I was on a domestic violence call, and it was one of these calls where I would have just arrested the guy. I would have just \u2014 \u201CHey, enough\u2019s enough,\u201D you know? This was a scenario where breaking up is hard to do, and there was a little girl, and they were exchanging custody. And he was kind of holding the little girl hostage, not wanting to give her back to Mom. And there had been no violence that had taken place, but both Mom and the little girl were very scared and intimidated. And ordinarily I would have said, \u201CThat\u2019s it,\u201D slapped the handcuffs on him, taken him to jail. But something stopped me, and it was I had just come out of this retreat. And I got the little girl, got him to give me the little girl, took care of her, got her and her mom set, told them just to leave, went back. And I just talked to this guy from my heart, and within five minutes \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve got this big gun belt on. I\u2019m about 5\u20193\u2033. Right? And this guy\u2019s like 6\u20196\u2033. And he\u2019s bawling. And I\u2019m holding this guy with this big gun belt on and everything. And he was just in incredible pain, and that\u2019s what I started realizing we deal with is misplaced anger because people are in incredible pain. So I ran into him three days later in a little store on Willy Street, where I lived at the time. And this guy comes \u2014 he sees me off-duty, he picks me up, gives me this big bear hug, and said, \u201CYou saved my life that night. Thank you.\u201D And so when you have experiences like that, and you start to realize, \u201CWell, what am I doing different here?\u201D I mean, really, it\u2019s about softening your heart. When you\u2019re a police officer and you do this work, you need to find a way to be able to maintain both the compassionate bodhisattva within you and the fierce bodhisattva and know when each is called for and how to combine the two. And once you start down this path, it\u2019s possible to learn that. Did you have a hand in making this retreat happen? Is that right? When I decided to take my practice further \u2014 in about 2000, I really got much more committed. And then I decided I wanted to become a member of the order, a core member of the order. And then I went out to Plum Village last year. In France? In France for three weeks, which was probably one of the most wonderful three weeks of my entire life. You know, as a police officer, you\u2019re so often a victim and so often an oppressor. You really have to come to grips with both of those. And I wrote a letter to Thay, because when you want to receive the mindfulness trainings, that\u2019s one of the requirements. He got my letter, which talked a lot about sort of where I\u2019m at with all this, and the next day gave this two-hour dharma talk on the different faces of love and why it\u2019s possible to be a bodhisattva and carry a gun. It was just unbelievable to me. I just started having this image while I was out there of my co-workers, other police officers, holding hands and making \u2014 doing walking meditation together and making peaceful steps on the Earth together. And I mentioned it during a working meditation with one of the people. She said, \u201CYou know, you can make that happen.\u201D So by the end of the retreat, I got on the stage with Thay, and I asked him if he would do a retreat for police officers. And he said yes, and this is it. And tell me what you are hearing or experiencing of the effect this is having on your colleagues. Well, at first, it was kind of a mini revolt because they really thought \u2014 it\u2019s a very, very big thing having to face the possibility of having to kill somebody that you could face every day. They wanted to talk about that with each other. They wanted to talk about, \u201CWhy are we so critical of each other? Why is there so much stress in our workplaces? How can we apply some of these concepts?\u201D And they also sometimes, if you\u2019ve never been exposed to Thich Nhat Hanh and \u2014 I can translate the language for them, but some of them hear, \u201CYou can never, never fight violence with violence.\u201D And they\u2019re saying to me, \u201CWell, what the hell am I supposed to do when somebody\u2019s beating the crap out of somebody? Am I supposed to stand there and watch them?\u201D So some of it is literally a translation thing. But to watch them getting the sort of understanding and exposure that I had early on, just to see that there\u2019s some richness and nourishment here. And what we talked about yesterday is my first Zen activity as a little girl was baseball because that was the first activity that I ever performed where I was so absorbed in it my total focus and concentration was there and nothing else was present. And that\u2019s a definition of Zen. That\u2019s my definition of Zen. And so you have to, as a practitioner, find the ways to practice that resonate with you. And if you are faithful to your practice, your practice will be faithful to you. Police officers, as you can imagine, the major problem is we deal with being hypervigilant all the time, so we\u2019re off the scale up here. You know, you\u2019re looking around you all the time wondering where that next problem is coming from. And if you don\u2019t have a way to come back down and find some ways to take care of yourself, you\u2019re going to find ways to stay up there because it feels good in an odd sort of way, in dysfunctional ways. You know, I asked Thay, \u201CHow is your teaching different when you\u2019re speaking to these different kinds of groups?\u201D And his answer was so interesting, that he has to come to understand the particular suffering of that group of people. It\u2019s a special form, and Thay has really taken so much time to understand it. And where our suffering comes from is really two places. One, we deal with the 5 percent of the worst part of society, so you start \u2014 you don\u2019t want your kids exposed to that. You don\u2019t want your partner exposed to that. It\u2019s got to go somewhere. You don\u2019t know who to talk to about it, but it starts to affect the way you see people. That\u2019s one thing. And the accumulated stress of \u2014 if you\u2019re a young officer and you go to your first accident scene where somebody\u2019s head has been rolled over, you go to your first \u2014 you go to a homicide scene and you see very grisly details, you go to lots of different things that \u2014 one incident may not cause it, but the accumulated sort of stuff post-traumatic stress is made from, and you start shutting down and you don\u2019t realize it. So you need tools to keep your heart open and soft. After 20 years as a police officer, Cheri Maples served as the head of Probation and Parole in Wisconsin and an assistant attorney general before being ordained as a dharma teacher by Thich Nhat Hanh in 2008. She is now a licensed attorney and clinical social worker, and she\u2019s co-founded the Center for Mindfulness and Justice in Madison, Wisconsin. You can listen again and share this program at onbeing.org. There you\u2019ll also find some of the photos and dharma talks from this retreat. Again, onbeing.org Coming up, Thich Nhat Hanh on the implications of his teachings for the war on terror. We live in a time when we have a very sophisticated means for communication, but communication has become very difficult between individuals and groups of people. A father cannot talk to a son, mother cannot talk to a daughter, and Israelis cannot talk to Palestinians, and Hindus cannot talk to Muslims. And that is why we have war, we have violence. That is why restoring communication is the basic work for peace, and our political and our spiritual leaders have to focus their energy on this matter. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, a radio pilgrimage with Zen master and poet Thich Nhat Hanh. During the Vietnam War, Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s ideas and examples influenced the Catholic monk and author Thomas Merton and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Millions of people since have read his classic manual of meditation, The Miracle of Mindfulness. He writes, \u201CMeditation is not evasion. It is a serene encounter with reality. The person who practices mindfulness should be no less awake than the driver of a car. Be as awake as a person walking on high stilts \u2014 any misstep could cause the walker to fall. Be like a lion going forward with slow, gentle, and firm steps. Only with this kind of vigilance can you realize total awakening.\u201D At this retreat led by Thich Nhat Hanh on Green Lake in Wisconsin, day begins with walking meditation at dawn. Hundreds of people step slowly, conscious of their breathing and every movement of their bodies. As a group, they wind around the lake and through the trees. Thich Nhat Hanh walks in front, holding the hand of a small child. In a manual he\u2019s written about walking meditation, one of his signature practices, he advises practitioners to take the hand of a child. \u201CThough the child might alter the solemnity of meditation,\u201D he writes, \u201Cshe will receive your concentration and stability, and you will receive her freshness and innocence.\u201D The walkers maintain silence. This noble silence, as they call it, is also held at meals. Periodically, the sound of a bell stills the cafeteria dining room. This is a reminder to breathe, to eat only what is required to nourish the body, and to be present in the moment. Attention to the present moment is the heart of Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s passion. And this is a way of life rather than a system of belief. In fact, he insists that attentive living will constantly cause us to question our own reactions and convictions. We suffer, he says, because of wrong perceptions of ourselves and others, which is why communication is so difficult and so important. Forgiveness, he says, comes from looking deeply and understanding. Violence, in our families or in the larger world, can stop with us. Living this way, he says, we become \u201Cfresh, solid, and free.\u201D Some of the things you\u2019ve said about the war on terror, you used the word \u201Cforgiveness\u201D right away, and I don\u2019t think that was a word that was anywhere in our public discourse in this country. But I also heard you this morning, when you were speaking with the group, talking about the responsibility of everyone also for policies, global policies. Say some more about that, about what role individuals have to play even in something like the war on terror, from your perspective. The individual has to wake up to the fact that violence cannot end violence, that only understanding and compassion can neutralize violence because, with the practice of loving speech and compassionate listening, you can begin to understand people and help people to remove the wrong perceptions in them because these wrong perceptions are at the foundation of their anger, their fear, their violence, their hate. And listen deeply. You might be able to remove the wrong perception you have within yourself concerning you and concerning them. So the basic practice in order to remove terrorism and war is the practice of removing wrong perceptions, and that cannot be done with the bombs and the guns. And it is very important that our political leaders realize that and apply the techniques of communication. We live in a time when we have a very sophisticated means for communication, but communication has become very difficult between individuals and groups of people. A father cannot talk to a son, mother cannot talk to a daughter, and maybe husband cannot talk to a wife. And Israelis cannot talk to Palestinians, and Hindus cannot talk to Muslims. And that is why we have war, we have violence. That is why restoring communication is the basic work for peace, and our political and our spiritual leaders have to focus all their energy on this matter. But I think some would say \u2014 people in positions of power would say that they simply can\u2019t wait for that communication to happen or for that change to take place, that they also have to act now. If they cannot communicate with themselves, if they cannot communicate with members of their family, if they cannot communicate with people in their own country, they have no understanding that will serve as a base for right action, and they will make a lot of mistakes. I\u2019m wondering if, by way of bringing this back to you and the practice and how you know the practice, if you would read this poem, \u201CFor Warmth,\u201D and talk about how you think about anger and how one lives with anger. Being mindful doesn\u2019t take away all these emotions. Right? These human emotions. Well, we have to remain human in order to be able to understand and to be compassionate. You have the right to be angry, but you don\u2019t have the right not to practice in order to transform your anger. You have the right to make mistakes, but you don\u2019t have the right to continue making mistakes. You have to learn from the mistakes. Mm-hmm. And would you say something about when you \u2014 the occasion on which you wrote this poem also? I wrote this poem after I hear the news that the city of Ben Tre was bombed, and an American army officer declared that he had to destroy the town in order to save the town. It was so very shocking for us. In fact, there were a number of guerillas who came to the town, and we use anti-aircraft gun to shoot, and, because of that, they bombarded the town and killed so many civilians. Was it 1965 or something like that? Yeah, around that time. OK. \u201CI hold my face between my hands. No, I am not crying. I hold my face between my hands to keep my loneliness warm, two hands protecting, two hands nourishing, two hands to prevent my soul from leaving me in anger.\u201D When you notice that anger is coming up in you, you have to practice mindful breathing in order to generate the energy of mindfulness, in order to recognize your anger and embrace it tenderly, so that you can bring relief into you and not to act and to say things that can destroy, that can be destructive. And doing so, you can look deeply into the nature of the anger and know where it has come from. That practice help us to realize that not only Vietnamese civilians and military were victims of the war, but also American men and women who came to Vietnam to kill and to be killed were also victims of the war. So here\u2019s the question that occurs to me again and again. These root causes are so simple in a way \u2014 wrong perception\u2026 Yes. \u2026poor communication\u2026 Yes. \u2026anger that may have its place in human life but then needs to be acted on mindfully, in your language. Why is it so hard for human beings \u2014 and I think this is as true in a family as it is in global politics \u2014 to take these simple things seriously, these simple aspects of being human? I don\u2019t think it is difficult. In the many retreats that we offer in Europe, in America, in many other countries, awakening, understanding, compassion, and reconciliation can take place after a few days of practice. People need an opportunity so that the seed of compassion, understanding in them to be watered. And that is why we are not discouraged. We know that if there are more people joining in the work of offering that opportunity, then there will be a collective awakening. I look at you and I also see that you view the world through the eyes of compassion, which is another term you use, and that I see the weight of that on you. It is also a burden to look at the world straight and to see suffering and to see the sources of suffering wherever you look. When you have compassion in your heart, you suffer much less, and you are in a situation to be and to do something to help others to suffer less. This is a truth. So to practice in such a way that brings compassion into your heart is very important. A person without compassion cannot be a happy person. And compassion is something that is possible only when you have understanding. Understanding brings compassion. Understanding is compassion itself. When you understand the difficulties, the suffering, the despair of the other person, you don\u2019t hate him, you don\u2019t hate her anymore. What would compassion look like towards a terrorist, let\u2019s say? The terrorists, they are victims of their wrong perceptions. They have wrong perceptions on themselves, and they have wrong perceptions of us. So the practice of communication, peaceful communication, can help them to remove their wrong perceptions on them and on us and the wrong perceptions we have on us and on them. This is the basic practice. This is the principle. And I hope that our political leaders understand this and take action right away to help us. And we, as citizens, we have to voice our concern very strongly because we should support our political leaders because we have help elect them. We should not leave everything to them. We should live out daily in such a way that we could have the time and energy in order to bring our light, our support to our political leaders. We should not hate our leaders. We should not be angry at our leaders. We should only support them and help them to see right in order to act right. I want to finish because I know I\u2019ve taken a lot of your time. I want to ask you, this is from Fragrant Palm Leaves, which I know is a journal you wrote in the 1960s, but this is about Zen: \u201CZen is not merely a system of thought. Zen infuses our whole being with the most pressing question we have.\u201D What are your pressing questions at this point in your life? Pressing questions? Mm-hmm. What are the questions you work through in your practice just personally, I wonder. I do not have any questions right now. My practice is to live in the here and the now. And it is a great happiness for you to be able to live and to do what you like to live and to do. My practice is centered in the present moment. I know that if you know how to handle the present moment right, with our best, and then that is about everything you can do for the future. That is why I\u2019m at peace with myself. That\u2019s my practice every day, and that is very nourishing. And I wonder, living that way and practicing that way, does forgiveness become instinctive? Does there become a point where you no longer react with anger but immediately become compassionate and forgiving? When you practice looking at people with the eyes of compassion, that kind of practice will become a good habit. And you are capable of looking at the people in such a way that you can see the suffering, the difficulties. And if you can see, then compassion will naturally flow from your heart. It\u2019s for your sake, and that is for their sake also. In The Lotus Sutra, there is a wonderful, five-word sentence. \u201CLooking at living beings with the eyes of compassion.\u201D And that brings you happiness. That brings relief into the world. And this practice can be done by every one of us. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, Brother Thay \u2014 a radio pilgrimage with Vietnamese Zen master and poet Thich Nhat Hanh. We end with Larry Ward, one of 500 people in attendance at this retreat. He\u2019s a former management consultant for Fortune 500 companies and an ordained Baptist minister. Now, he and his wife lead a meditation center in California. I was introduced to Thay through my wife, who was then my fianc\u00E9e. A number of years ago, her first husband passed away in a tragic accident. And as we began to get closer some years later, she told me that there\u2019s this monk coming to the United States, and he came every two years. And it was one of the fundamental things that helped her heal her grief after her husband passed away and that that experience meant so much to her, she\u2019d like for me to go with her to a retreat to meet this teacher. So tell me what it was about the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, this particular way that he\u2019s developed Vietnamese Zen, that affected you, that has been important to you. OK. Two things that particularly were inspiring to me of Thay\u2019s teachings: one was his ability to translate Buddhist practice as human spirituality, and secondly, to do that with great heart. And I think one of the contributions of the Vietnamese aspect of Thay is the great heart, the sense of poetry, metaphor that he brings with depth, intellectual clarity, and scholarship. And so that combination is very appealing. Yeah. I wonder if you can think of, say, a situation where you think you might have done something differently than you would have before, a concrete way in which it changed your action or reaction in some way. When my mother passed away about seven years ago, I was actually on vacation with my wife and some friends in Costa Rica. And I was in a small village that only had two telephones, one private, one public. The public one did not work. This was around Christmastime. So when I was finally able to get a phone and call, I found out my mother died. And so I went \u2014 it took three days to get back to Cleveland where she was, and by that time, she was already buried. And my father was overwhelmed with grief. And he was so overwhelmed with grief that, after the burial, he went home, and he shut the door, and he wouldn\u2019t let any of the children in the house. So I started sending him flowers and love letters over six months\u2019 time. And I would go visit, and I\u2019d sit outside the house, and bring my flowers, and put them on the porch. And this is after flying from Idaho or wherever I was. And I knew he was in there, and I\u2019d leave them. And then I\u2019d go on and visit my sister, you know, etc., etc. And finally, he opened the door, which was, to me, opening the door to himself. And so now, we\u2019re in a totally different environment and a different situation. And I\u2019m certain that, without the practice, that is not how I would have responded to an experience, quote/unquote, of \u201Crejection.\u201D I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. If I\u2019d have been operating out of that mindset of my youth, I would\u2019ve just said, \u201CForget you.\u201D And, instead, I was able to understand what was happening to my father. I could see and feel his suffering, his tremendous heartbreak. I knew that he didn\u2019t have any training in dealing with emotion. None. And I knew that, in my family, my mother was the emotional intelligence, and that when she passed away, he had no skills, no capacity to handle the huge ocean of grief he found himself in. So my practice was to communicate to him that I was there for him, that I supported him, and that I loved him. But my practice also was to hold compassion for him and myself and my family so that we could all go through our grieving process peacefully and at our own pace. When I interviewed Thay yesterday, I said to him that I\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s doing retreats for different kinds of groups of people, you know, law enforcement officers, members of Congress, people of color. On the surface \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what that was about. And then when I asked him, \u201CIs your teaching different?\u201D And he said, \u201CYou know, what I\u2019m trying to do, what I have to do every time is understand the particular suffering of these people who\u2019ve lived with a certain kind of identity.\u201D And I\u2019d like to ask you, as an African-American man, do you feel that this Vietnamese Buddhist monk can speak to your suffering or your identity? How do you experience the coming together of his culture and yours? From a distance, many years ago, I heard Martin Luther King mention that a monk had asked him to come out against the Vietnam War and that he was nominating this monk for the Nobel Prize. And I had heard that before my wife introduced me to Thich Nhat Hanh, and it was only during the middle of the retreat that the dots got connected for me. Oh, in the early \u201990s? In the early \u201990s. Yeah. That you realized that that was the monk? That was the monk. Wow. And unequivocally, yes. Thay\u2019s deep practice emerged in the midst of tremendous suffering of the war. And that\u2019s a part to me of his authenticity is if, as he\u2019s able to be peaceful, and graceful, and kind \u2014 and I know some of the things he experienced in the war because I also had family members in the war. But for him to be able to be that peaceful, and that openhearted, and that kind in the midst of the suffering he experienced without denying the suffering, I think that\u2019s a perfect model, pathway, through the African-American experience into the full human experience. A cynic would say, \u201CWell, he can give these beautiful teachings about ending violence. And then there are these individuals who come to a retreat like this who are clearly taking this seriously and taking this back to their lives, but they\u2019re just drops in the ocean.\u201D That is true. I am a drop in the ocean, but I\u2019m also the ocean. I\u2019m a drop in America, but I\u2019m also America. Every pain, every confusion, every good, and every bad, and every ugly of America is in me. And as I\u2019m able to transform myself, and heal myself, and take care of myself, I\u2019m very conscious that I\u2019m healing, and transforming, and taking care of America. Particularly, I\u2019m saying this for American cynics. But this is also true globally. And so as we\u2019re able, however small, however slowly, it\u2019s for real. Larry Ward co-directs the Lotus Institute devoted to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh in Encinitas, California. He\u2019s co-authored a book with his wife, Love\u2019s Garden: A Guide to Mindful Relationships. The Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh makes his home in Plum Village in France. His books include The Miracle of Mindfulness, and more recently The Art of Communicating. I also especially love his book The Long Road Turns to Joy: A Guide to Walking Meditation. You can listen again or share this show at onbeing.org. There you will also find an entire dharma talk by Thich Nhat Hanh as well as a poem by Tess Gallagher on her mindfulness training with him. And recently, I called up Cheri Maples, who we heard earlier in the hour, because I wanted to hear her reflection as a police officer turned dharma teacher on events in Ferguson and beyond. We had a wide-ranging conversation on the human and structural challenges of police work, and the competing philosophies around that work that have given us some of the crises we\u2019re now facing. Find that entire conversation at onbeing.org."
