  "fullText": "Very rarely do you hear anyone say they write things down and feel worse. It\u2019s an act that helps you, preserves you, energizes you, in the very doing of it. \u201CYou are living in a poem.\u201D This is how the poet Naomi Shihab Nye sees the world, and she teaches how this way of being and writing is possible. She has engaged the real-world power of words since her upbringing between her father\u2019s Palestinian homeland and Ferguson, Missouri, near where her American mother grew up. Her father was a refugee journalist, and she carries forward his hopeful passion, his insistence, that language must be a way out of cycles of animosity. A poem she wrote called \u201CKindness,\u201D is carried around in the pockets and memories of readers around the world. \u201CBefore you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. You must wake up with sorrow. You must speak to it till your voice catches the thread of all sorrows and you see the size of the cloth. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, only kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread, only kindness that raises its head from the crowd of the world to say It is I you have been looking for, and then goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend.\u201D I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Naomi Shihab Nye calls herself a wandering poet. Growing up, she lived in Ferguson and on the road between Ramallah and Jerusalem. And now, she lives in San Antonio, Texas. I always start my interviews by inquiring about the religious or spiritual background of someone\u2019s childhood. And I just wonder where you\u2019d start reflecting on what that was in your life. Well, I felt very lucky as a child to have open-minded parents. And I knew they were open-minded because they were unlike any other parents I met, my friends\u2019 parents. I also knew that they didn\u2019t practice the religions of their upbringings, either one of them. So, this fascinated me as even a little child. And I would ask a lot of questions. There was no sense of a taboo subject. My father had not really had a difficult time telling his family that he didn\u2019t want to practice Islam. He said, \u201CI will respect it, but I don\u2019t want to practice it.\u201D And they had accepted that. My mother\u2019s family, on the other hand, had been more hard-hearted about her rejection of their German Lutheran Missouri Synod background. But this was something both of my parents could talk about with each other and with their children, that people are raised in all kinds of different ways, and if it doesn\u2019t feel meaningful to you, maybe you have to search more. You have to keep searching. And I was a religion major in college simply because\u2026 Of course you were. Yeah. Because of my appetite for this topic. That\u2019s right. And I was fascinated to study more about Zen Buddhism, which appealed to me very much from the beginning. And it seems like you became a writer at a very young age, right? You were like 7, 6, 5 \u2014 6, 7? I was 6 when I started writing my own poems and 7 when I started sending them out. And just today, some students I was talking to in a Skype class in Kuwait \u2014 how much I love the modern world that we can do these things. I was with these students for two hours, and I feel like I\u2019m going to think about them for the rest of my life. But one young man asked me, \u201CHow were you brave enough to do that? What gave you the confidence?\u201D He said, \u201CI\u2019ve been trying to run a publication here at our university campus, and I can\u2019t get my friends to give me their writing. They\u2019re not brave enough. What gave you confidence?\u201D And I think just having that sense of voice. Well, other people have done it. That\u2019s what we do. If you know words, if you compose, you might want to share them because they\u2019ll have a bigger life if you do that. So, I certainly wasn\u2019t thinking about a career. I just thought of myself as having a practice, you know? If you have a practice of writing, then you have a lot of pieces of paper on your desk, and you can share them if you chose to. And it seemed more exciting or illuminating to share them and see what happened next than to just keep them for myself. Well, so \u2014 I\u2019m very interested in general in this question of what poetry works in us. But I think even that question itself holds the implication that poetry is something separate, something distinct. But it seems that, in your sensibility, you see it as very organic. I mean, there\u2019s \u2014 I think it was in some of your writing for poems by children, you said, \u201CI do think that all of us think in poems.\u201D I do. I do think that. And I think that is very important, not feeling separate from text, feeling sort of your thoughts as text or the world as it passes through you as a kind of text. The story that you would be telling to yourself about the street, even as you walk down it, or as you drive down it, as you look out the window, the story you would be telling \u2014 it always seemed very much to me, as a child, that I was living in a poem, that my life was the poem. And in fact, at this late date, I have started putting that on the board of any room I walk into that has a board. I just came back from Japan a month ago, and in every classroom, I would just write on the board, \u201CYou are living in a poem.\u201D And then I would write other things just relating to whatever we were doing in that class. But I found the students very intrigued by discussing that. \u201CWhat do you mean, we\u2019re living in a poem?\u201D Or, \u201CWhen? All the time, or just when someone talks about poetry?\u201D And I\u2019d say, \u201CNo, when you think, when you\u2019re in a very quiet place, when you\u2019re remembering, when you\u2019re savoring an image, when you\u2019re allowing your mind calmly to leap from one thought to another, that\u2019s a poem. That\u2019s what a poem does.\u201D And they liked that. And a girl, in fact, wrote me a note in Yokohama on the day that I was leaving her school that has come to be the most significant note any student has written me in years. She said, \u201CWell, here in Japan, we have a concept called \u2018yutori.\u2019\u201D And it is spaciousness. It\u2019s a kind of living with spaciousness. For example, it\u2019s leaving early enough to get somewhere so that you know you\u2019re going to arrive early, so when you get there, you have time to look around. Or \u2014 and then she gave all these different definitions of what yutori was to her. But one of them was \u2014 and after you read a poem just knowing you can hold it, you can be in that space of the poem. And it can hold you in its space. And you don\u2019t have to explain it. You don\u2019t have to paraphrase it. You just hold it, and it allows you to see differently. And I just love that. I mean, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say all these years. I should have studied Japanese. Maybe that\u2019s where all our answers are. In Japanese. Well, so \u2014 I do also think about your Arabic ancestry and the reverence for poetry that is in those cultures. Yes. And you talk a lot about your father and his reverence for just the power of words and language. And here\u2019s a way you, I feel, have appropriated that: you say poetry is a form of conversation. And it seems to me that a lot of your poems are \u2014 can I say \u2014 holding a conversation, or opening conversations that aren\u2019t actually happening out there in the culture or in the narrative of kind of how we\u2019re telling the story of our time. I hope so, Krista. I really hope that is true. And I think that the essence of a kind of exchange is what poetry is interested in too. I mean, the feeling that you\u2019re not battered by thought in a poem, but you are sort of as if you\u2019re riding the wave of thought, as if you\u2019re allowing thought to enter. You\u2019re shifting. You\u2019re changing. You\u2019re looking. You are in a sensibility that allows you that sort of mental, emotional, spiritual interaction with everything around you. I think it\u2019s very, very helpful for mental health, actually. I mean, I really wonder sometimes what it would be like to live without that apprehension \u2014 that you could have a thought, shape a thought, change a thought, look at the words in a thought. That you could take a word and just sort of use that word \u2014 I think I\u2019ve said this is 40 years ago in a poem \u2014 use a single word as an oar that could get you through the days just by holding a word, thinking about it differently, and seeing how that word rubs against other words, how it interplays with other words. There\u2019s a luxury in that kind of thinking about language and text, but it\u2019s very basic as well. I mean, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s invisible, it doesn\u2019t cost anything. Yeah. So, there\u2019s 19 Varieties of Gazelle. Was this published after\u2026 It was published after September 11, but some of the poems in it preceded September 11. But the poems that related to the Middle East had been sort of scattered throughout my work. Some were in magazines, never had been in a book. But I felt, at that moment, maybe it was important to gather them together. I mean, just the last \u2014 I think these are the final lines or almost \u2014 no \u2014 yes, before the postscript, the final stanza of the last poem. \u201CI call my father, we talk around the news It is too much for him, neither of his two languages can reach it. I drive into the country to find sheep, cows, to plead with the air: Who calls anyone civilized? Where can the crying heart graze? What does a true Arab do now?\u201D Right. I imagine that question, by way of poetry, \u201CWhat does a true Arab do now?\u201D \u2014 that\u2019s a question that\u2019s been out there, I imagine, in our culture for Arab Americans. It\u2019s this question that we\u2019re dwelling with, all of us collectively, but especially people of that identity. And especially people who cherish an awareness of another culture, whoever they are. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so strangely appealing these days to large numbers of people \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they are, I don\u2019t understand where they\u2019re coming from \u2014 to not to respect someone else\u2019s culture if it doesn\u2019t look just like yours. And that\u2019s exactly the opposite of the way that I grew up and the way I like to think about the world and the way I feel like the majority of people would prefer to think about the world. Yes. The minute you place yourself above, what does that do to others? So yes, I am horrified by the ease with which people may belittle one another these days, as if that were a reasonable thing to do. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the poet Naomi Shihab Nye. You also have this fascinating perspective of having \u2014 OK, let me get this right. Your father \u2014 you mostly grew up in Ferguson, Missouri, which is where your father\u2026 Yeah, I did. It\u2019s crazy, right? Nobody had ever heard of it either. His family emigrated eventually. Yeah. And so, how long were you there? Until you were 12 or\u2026? Well, I lived in Ferguson until I was 14. 14. Yes. And I was born in Greater St. Louis, my mother\u2019s home place. My parents met in Kansas, but they moved out to Ferguson because it was sort of a little bedroom community to Downtown St. Louis where my mother had grown up. And it had big trees, and kids could go off on their bikes and ride around all day, and there was more a rural quality to Ferguson. It\u2019s a wonderful little community, but there was a sense of separation, of course, in the \u201950s and early \u201960s that is what we\u2019ve seen the fruits of that come to be over the years. And to think that Ferguson is now a household word representing injustice is really shocking to those of us who grew up there. But when you wrote this wonderful piece about growing up in Ferguson, and then your family immigrated back to Palestine in 1966 for a little while. Right. And the echoes between those two places that you called home, the echoes between those two places and their separated communities. Right. That was a fascinating parallel. And so I couldn\u2019t resist writing that piece, just meditating on both places when they were in flames that same summer. And the sorrow of injustice was very alive in both of them. In 2014. Yeah. And the power struggles in both places. And I kept wishing my father were alive because I thought he would never believe that Ferguson has come into the international eye in this way. At the same time as the people of Palestine are also continuing to struggle. So, it\u2019s mysterious how these power structures unfold, isn\u2019t it? And how we\u2019re willing to accept them and allow them to prevail without questioning them. And something I\u2019ve started saying over the past few years that kind of helped me think about it is \u2014 I have so many Jewish friends both in the United States and other countries who would agree with this \u2014 but the idea that there could not be a sort of alliance between big power countries like the United States and Israel/Palestine that was more equivalent. Why do you have to have only one friend in the region? That\u2019s like the dark side of junior high. In junior high, you learned that you could probably have two friends that are not exactly alike, and you might survive. And in fact, you\u2019d be a much more interesting person. Why couldn\u2019t the United States have two friends? Why couldn\u2019t they ask better questions? My father was always saddened by the imbalance. And as a journalist, he had to report on it so many times. Yes. And yet, you always write about your father insisting on hope to the end. Yeah. Fiercely hopeful. Yeah, because he said, \u201CWhat else do we have?\u201D I mean, if we\u2019re just going to give up and say, \u201COK, we crumple. We have no more hope. We\u2019re victims. We\u2019re bitter.\u201D How much fun of a life is that going to be for anyone? For our children, you can\u2019t pass that down. He maintained a joyousness, despite. But here\u2019s another way you\u2019ve written about what I feel is kind of a philosophy behind your poetry. And you wrote this, again, about in the aftermath of September 11, but it applies to all these kinds of examples we\u2019ve been talking about. You said this sense so many people had that \u201Ceverything has changed.\u201D And you wrote of the necessity of really questioning and interrogating that feeling. And you wrote, \u201CWe can continue to remind ourselves of what is important and try to live in ways nourishing for human beings and continue to nourish our ability to grow in our perceptions to more than we used to know, to empathize with distant situations and sorrows and joys.\u201D That doesn\u2019t have to change. Right. I have felt so much that that was the great lost opportunity of 2001, of September 11, for Americans who had momentarily had an experience of what so many people around the world have all the time of\u2026 Right. There are just so many mysteries about people wanting to presume their pain has more of a reality than someone else\u2019s pain. And you know, I think all the holy persons of all backgrounds and faiths have always called upon us to empathize in a more profound way, to stretch our imaginations to what that other person might be experiencing. And it sounds so basic, but these days, when you listen to the loud voices you wonder, \u201CWhat\u2019s happened to that? What\u2019s happened to the awareness that we don\u2019t have to be vindictive and continue on in a cycle of revenge and violence?\u201D And every time Yoko Ono pays to have that full page in the New York Times, the \u201DWar is Over\u201D page, I\u2019m fascinated by that. I know. I mean, I\u2019d love to hear her talk about why she continues to do this because we so much wish it were true. We\u2019d like to be able to say, \u201CYes, it\u2019s true.\u201D I actually kept that postcard that said \u201DWar is Over\u201D in that same font on my wall for years because I so much wanted to believe it. And yet, you look at the world, and it\u2019s not true. And you think, \u201CIs this just manifest positive thinking?\u201D Well, OK. But so, here\u2019s what I think your contribution is. I mean, you look at the world in terms of headlines, and it\u2019s \u2014 you look at the world a certain way, and it\u2019s not true from a certain angle, from a certain direction. It seems to me like one of the things you \u2014 again, like, what is poetry? What\u2019s poetry\u2019s place? I mean, it seems like one of the things you draw out is just noticing. Yeah. Paying a different kind of attention to things that are not quite as apparent to the eye. I mean, starting with \u2014 I love this \u2014 the poem \u2014 and what book was it in? \u201CPlease Describe How You Became A Writer.\u201D Oh. Right. Yeah. Do you know that? Do you have it by heart? I have it right here. Yes. Would you like me to read it? Yes. It\u2019s very short. \u201CPlease Describe How You Became A Writer\u201D \u201CPossibly I began writing as a refuge from our insulting first-grade textbook. Come, Jane, come. Look, Dick, look. Were there ever duller people in the world? You had to tell them to look at things? Why weren\u2019t they looking to begin with?\u201D That was actually written after some students wrote me a survey about being a writer, and that was the first question on their survey. And so I just wrote them that, and I thought, \u201CI like this by itself. This is good.\u201D I mean, it\u2019s true too. Yeah. And so, I think you unfold that on different levels. I mean, somewhere you talk about being a 7-year-old poet making petite discoveries. I love that phrase. Yeah. Oh, thanks. And again, like, noticing, right? Right. I like the word \u201Cpetite.\u201D Oh, it\u2019s \u2014 and there\u2019s a poem you wrote about an onion. \u201CI could kneel and praise all small forgotten miracles, crackly paper peeling on the drainboard, pearly layers in smooth agreement, the way the knife enters onion and onion falls apart on the chopping block, a history revealed.\u201D I mean, this is a way \u2014 again, we\u2019re talking about poetry, but we\u2019re also talking about a way of moving through the world. Mm. Thank you for noticing that. But I think of something in an essay from William Merwin. And he\u2019s lived in many places in his life. He lived in France, England, Mexico, Pennsylvania as a child. But he has a line where he says, \u201CI learned from my neighbors everything they would tell me.\u201D And I think that sort of appetite for knowing, that curiosity \u2014 \u201CWhat grows here? What do we need to do? How can we improve this soil?\u201D That\u2019s the way that he lived his whole life. But I think that\u2019s what poetry does for our places wherever we are. It allows us to cherish what we\u2019re given. \u201CTwo Countries.\u201D \u201CSkin remembers how long the years grow when skin is not touched, a gray tunnel of singleness, feather lost from the tail of a bird, swirling onto a step, swept away by someone who never saw it was a feather. Skin ate, walked, slept by itself, knew how to raise a see-you-later hand. But skin felt it was never seen, never known as a land on the map, nose like a city, hip like a city, gleaming dome of the mosque and the hundred corridors of cinnamon and rope. Skin had hope, that\u2019s what skin does. Heals over the scarred place, makes a road. Love means you breathe in two countries. And skin remembers\u2013silk, spiny grass, deep in the pocket that is skin\u2019s secret own. Even now, when skin is not alone, it remembers being alone and thanks something larger that there are travelers, that people go places larger than themselves.\u201D You can listen again and share this conversation with Naomi Shihab Nye through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the \u201Cwandering poet\u201D Naomi Shihab Nye. I know your poem \u201CKindness\u201D has been really important for many people. It\u2019s interesting that \u2014 would you kind of tell it? Because the backstory to that poem doesn\u2019t sound like the circumstances under which you would write a poem about kindness. Right. And so, I\u2019d love for you to just tell that story, and then maybe read it also. Well, I really feel, amongst all my poems, that this was a poem that was given to me. I was simply the secretary for the poem. I wrote it down, but I honestly felt as if it were a female voice speaking in the air across a plaza in Popayan, Colombia. And my husband and I were on our honeymoon. We had just gotten married one week before here in Texas. And we had this plan to travel in South America for three months. And at the end of our first week, we were robbed of everything. And someone else who was on the bus with us was killed, and he\u2019s the Indian in the poem. And it was quite a shake-up of an experience. And what do you do now? We didn\u2019t have passports. We didn\u2019t have money. We didn\u2019t have anything. What do we do first? Where do we go? Who do we talk to? And a man came up to us on the street and was simply kind and just looked at us, I guess could see our disarray in our faces. And just asked us in Spanish, \u201CWhat happened to you?\u201D And we tried to tell him. And he listened to us, and he looked so sad. And he said, \u201CI\u2019m very sorry. I\u2019m very, very sorry that happened,\u201D in Spanish. And he went on. And then we went to this little plaza, and I sat down, and all I had was the notebook in my back pocket and pencil. And my husband was going to hitchhike off to Cali, a larger city, to see about getting traveler\u2019s checks reinstated. Remember those archaic things? Yes, I do. Traveler\u2019s checks. Vaguely. Yeah. I haven\u2019t seen one in years. No. And so this was also a little worrisome to us because, suddenly, we were going to split up. I was going to stay here, and he was going to go there. And as I sat there alone, in a bit of a panic, night coming on, trying to figure out what I was going to do next, this voice came across the plaza and spoke this poem to me, spoke it. And I wrote it down. Wow. I was just the scribe. So, did you want me to read it? Yes, I\u2019d love for you to read it. \u201CBefore you know what kindness really is you must lose things, feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt in a weakened broth. What you held in your hand, what you counted and carefully saved, all this must go so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness. How you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop, the passengers eating maize and chicken will stare out the window forever. Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho lies dead by the side of the road. You must see how this could be you, how he too was someone who journeyed through the night with plans and the simple breath that kept him alive. Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. You must wake up with sorrow. You must speak to it till your voice catches the thread of all sorrows and you see the size of the cloth. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, only kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread, only kindness that raises its head from the crowd of the world to say It is I you have been looking for, and then goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend.\u201D One thing I\u2019ve tried to say to groups over the years, groups of all ages, is that writing things down, whatever you\u2019re writing down, even if you\u2019re writing something sad or hard, usually you feel better after you do it. Somehow, you\u2019re given a sense of, \u201COK, this mood, this sorrow I\u2019m feeling, this trouble I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve given it shape. It\u2019s got a shape on the page now. So I can stand back, I can look at it, I can think about it a little differently. What do I do now?\u201D And very rarely do you hear anyone say they write things down and feel worse. They always say, \u201CI wrote things down. This isn\u2019t quite finished. I need to work on it.\u201D But they agree that it helped them sort of see their experience, see what they were living. And that\u2019s definitely a gift of writing that is above and beyond any sort of vocational \u2014 how much somebody publishes. It\u2019s an act that helps you, preserves you, energizes you in the very doing of it. And actually, I interviewed Mary Oliver last year. And she said \u2014 and by the way, she also described the poem \u201CWild Geese,\u201D not as a voice coming to her, but basically as something that was just given. She said there are maybe two or three, but that one, she wasn\u2019t even thinking. Yeah. That\u2019s beautiful. And that poem is so important to so many people. Well, like \u201CKindness,\u201D it\u2019s a poem that saves lives. Right. It\u2019s a poem that saves lives. It\u2019s a poem that becomes like an emblem poem for people. Right. It is. Yeah. And \u2014 but she always carries a notebook, right? I mean, that\u2019s one of her trademarks. And she said to me, \u201CIf you don\u2019t have a notebook, you don\u2019t get it again. You have to write things down as they come to you.\u201D That\u2019s right. Absolutely. And so I\u2019ve started carrying a notebook again after 20 years. Well, I think that\u2019s great. And you can carry one at any age, and you\u2019re never too too old to start. To start carrying a notebook. Yeah. Last week, I was in a classroom in Austin, Texas, where a girl, who was apparently going through a really rough spell at home, wrote a poem that was definitely tragic and comic, both, about kind of \u2014 everybody was yelling at her in the poem, like, from all directions. She was just kind of suffering in her home place and trying to find peace, trying to find a place to do her homework. But she wrote this in such a compelling way that when she read it, and read it with gusto and joy \u2014 there was such joyousness in her voice even though she was describing something that sounded awful. When she finished, the girls in her classroom just broke into wild applause, and I saw her face. She lit up. And she said, \u201CMan, I feel better.\u201D And I thought, yeah, this is such a graphic example of putting words on the page. That feeling of being connected to someone else when you allow yourself to be very particular is another mystery of writing. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with poet Naomi Shihab Nye. Oh, here\u2019s something. I was just looking at A Maze Me, this book that you did, Poems for Girls, which actually echoes what you just said. You say, \u201CIf you have many voices and let them speak to one another in a friendly fashion, if you\u2019re not too proud to talk to yourself out loud, if you will ask the questions pressing against your forehead from the inside, you\u2019ll be OK. If you write three lines down in a notebook every day,\u201D and then in parentheses, \u201C(they don\u2019t have to be great or important, they don\u2019t have to relate to one another, you don\u2019t have to show them to anyone) you will find out what you notice. Uncanny connections will be made visible to you. That\u2019s what I started learning when I was 12, and I never stopped learning it.\u201D Right. And I think many people are encouraged to think you could write that little and still gain something from it. That you don\u2019t have to be spending an hour and a half to three hours to five hours a day writing to have a meaningful experience with it. It\u2019s a very immediate experience. You can sit down and write three sentences. How long does that take? Three minutes. Five minutes. And be giving yourself a very rare gift of listening to yourself, just finding out when you go back and look at what you wrote. And how many times we think, \u201COh, I would never have remembered that if I hadn\u2019t written it down.\u201D Yeah, that\u2019s right. \u201CWhen and how did that even occur to me? I sort of like it this week.\u201D That\u2019s right. \u201CAnd it could help me. And now I want to connect it to something else.\u201D Everybody finds that out, and just to encourage others to do it without a big massive goal in front of them at all times. You\u2019ve said that you read your son to sleep, and you also read him awake. I did. Yes. So what would you do? You\u2019d go in, and sit by his bed\u2026 Well, when when he was around 13, he said, \u201CMom, you don\u2019t have to read to me anymore. I can read for myself.\u201D And I said, \u201CYeah, I know. All the other parents I know stopped when their kids were like 8.\u201D Yeah. \u201COr 9. And I\u2019m still reading to you.\u201D But he was sweet and gracious about it. And we did like that reading time at bedtime. And so I paused for a while, maybe a year I wasn\u2019t reading to him. And then this farmer showed up in Oklahoma at a workshop and told us all that he had come just to listen. He just wanted to hear everyone read their work. And we thought, \u201CWow. Look at this. The wandering audience. He doesn\u2019t even want to participate; he just wants to listen.\u201D And he said, \u201CNo, listening is participation. It\u2019s very important.\u201D And he talked about being a child and being awakened every day by his granddad who read to the kids in the house as a wake-up call every morning, stood in the resonant hallway outside their bedrooms, and read poems. And my brain clicked. I thought, \u201CThis is what I\u2019ll do for the rest of the time our son is at home. I\u2019ll waken him every day with reading poems.\u201D So we did that for years, and I think he really liked it. And people I read a lot, people like Robert Blythe, and Lucille Clifton, Frank O\u2019Hara, for some reason, Chinese poems, Japanese poems. And we would occasionally talk about the poems. Later in the day, he\u2019d bring something up about one of the poems I\u2019d read. But I never did it so that we could have a particular conversation. I just did it because all parents have a moment in the day when you need to get your kid up if they haven\u2019t gotten up already. And most kids like to loiter in the bed there. So, it was a pleasure to me to hear poems in the air first thing in the morning, be saying them to our beloved son. And hopefully, he\u2019ll do that to his son, who turns one month old tomorrow. Wow. Yeah. I like that too because as much as \u2014 my kids are also great big now \u2014 but as many kind of lovely memories as I have of reading at the end of the day, you\u2019re so tired at the end of the day. And it\u2019s a nice idea to think about reading and poetry starting the day when you\u2019re fresh and when you would take it with you. It\u2019s beautiful. It feels beautiful. And you feel better. You, the reader, feel better. And there are also so many other places where this could be appropriate. I met a school principal some years ago, and he said to me, \u201COh, I\u2019ve always loved poetry, but I can\u2019t really use it because I\u2019m just a principal.\u201D I said, \u201CWhat are you talking about? Where\u2019s the intercom in your school?\u201D He said, \u201CIt\u2019s in my office.\u201D I said, \u201COK, well, do you have announcements?\u201D \u201CYes. Every morning.\u201D \u201CWell, why don\u2019t you read a poem to start off the day for the entire school?\u201D And I sort of forgot about this encounter with him, and a couple of years later, I went to that school, and I thought, \u201CWow, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in this school.\u201D I had forgotten that that\u2019s where he was. But these kids loved poetry. And finally one of them said to me, \u201CWell, the announcements, every day. Our principal reads us a poem, so we carry poems with us every day. We have them in our heads.\u201D And one thing interesting was he seemed to have needed a little push since he didn\u2019t see himself as a poet, that it would be OK for him to read a poem. Well, why not? And also, he needed a little push that he didn\u2019t have to read the whole poem. Like, if he wanted to read just a stanza from Ralph Waldo Emerson or just \u2014 here\u2019s a stanza from Walt Whitman \u2014 that that was OK. You didn\u2019t have to read the entire poem if you didn\u2019t have time. He liked that, but I think he just needed the encouragement. Before we draw to a close and also hear some more of your poems, I want to touch a little bit on your father again. Just on this matter of refugees, which is so resonant now in the world in a new, desperate way. It is. There\u2019s something in me that feels like we\u2019re kind of \u2014 it\u2019s happening \u2014 especially if you\u2019re in America, it\u2019s happening over there, kind of. But I wonder if when people look back 100 years from now \u2014 if we\u2019re still around \u2014 at 2016, if this won\u2019t be the thing that was changing the world that\u2019s going to shape the rest of the century. Whoa. Well, first of all, there\u2019s the opening page of Transfer where you\u2019re kind of dedicating the book to your father, the passage that starts \u201CRefugee, not always.\u201D Yes. \u201CRefugee not always once a confident schoolboy strolling Jerusalem streets He knew the alleyways spoke to stones All his life he would pick up stones and pocket them On some he drew faces What do we say in the wake of one who was always homesick? Are you home now? Is Palestine peaceful in some dimension we can\u2019t see? Do Jews and Arabs share the table? Is holy in the middle?\u201D And I think many times the way immigrants \u2014 people look at immigrants with such a sense of diminishment, as if this person is less than I am because they\u2019ve left their country. Well, I actually think they\u2019re more than we are because they\u2019re braver. They\u2019ve gone some other place. They have to operate in another language. How easy would that be? If I had to go to China today and start living in China and doing everything in Chinese, it would be very, very hard. So, you think about the bravery of these people and the desperation with which they\u2019re trying to find a realm of safety for their families and just the basic safeties that we take for granted every day we get up. And I don\u2019t know how a world with so many resources and so many religious traditions and good hopes, how we can keep doing these things to one another in the world that create refugee populations? I mean, it just seems outrageous. Why is that happening so much? Yeah. I think that\u2019s another one of those questions we have to sit with if we can. Yeah. Right. I mean, here\u2019s just some lines from another \u2014 the \u201CHistory\u201D poem in that book Transfer. \u201CWe were born to wander, to grieve, lost lineage. What we did to one another on a planet so wide open for doing.\u201D So wide open. So much we could do. Always. So many surprising moves a person, a country could make that might be imaginative, that might encourage positive behavior instead of negative. Yeah. And I don\u2019t know. Maybe the magnitude of this moment forces us to rise to the occasion. We\u2019ll see. Human beings do that every once in awhile too. I hope so. I hope so. And I hope that mysterious rising to one\u2019s better self, which was a concept that really perplexed me as a child. My mother would say, especially if I\u2019d been in some kind of mischief at school, which occasionally happened because I wasn\u2019t always focused on Jack and \u2014 whoever those people \u2014 Dick and Jane. Those boring Dick and Jane. Yeah, the boring Dick and Jane. I was trying to get away from them all the time. And so I would get in a little trouble, and my mother would say to me \u2014 her charge to me \u2014 \u201CBe your best self.\u201D And I would think, \u201CWow, what is that self? Where is it? Where is it tucked away? Where do I keep it when I\u2019m not being it? And are you your best self? Is my teacher her best self?\u201D That was just something intriguing to me that we had more than one self that we could operate out of. And I think one nice thing about writing is that you get to encounter, you get to meet these other selves, which continue on in you: your child self, your older self, your confused self, your self that makes a lot of mistakes. And then find some gracious way to have a community in there inside that would help you survive. Yeah, that poetry as conversation. That\u2019s right. Writing is a way of having a conversation between those different selves inside you. Yes. That\u2019s nice. I think so. And that\u2019s a big thing. I mean, that\u2019s not to be underestimated, that it\u2019s important to do that. You write about so many places you go, and that the word \u201Cgravity\u201D is important to you. It is. And it seems to me \u2014 it\u2019s a big word for you. And it seems to me, it\u2019s often related to a sense of place. I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always just about place. But how would you \u2014 what does that mean in your imagination? Well, my father felt like a wanderer, like he was always wandering around. And I always felt like a wanderer, that we have so many places we could explore and learn about. But I think you can feel all kinds of gravity wherever you are every day in different ways. And often, through human contact, you find your best gravity. A real conversation with someone, just a simple, simple exchange of words can give you a sense of gravity. Taking a long \u2014 I\u2019ve always loved the definition for contemplation, \u201Ca long, loving look.\u201D And when you take a long, loving look anywhere, you feel sort of more bonded with whatever you\u2019ve looked at. You feel as if you recognize it. You see it. Maybe it sees you back. And you\u2019re participating in a world where it exists. And so feeling that sense of gravity and belonging everywhere is very important to me. Like claiming it, right? That\u2019s what you do. I think you claim it. Claiming it. Yeah, a kind of global passport I guess it might be. And this young woman in Kuwait this morning on the Skype class I did \u2014 she was saying that she was Palestinian, had never been to Palestine; born in Jordan, had never seen Jordan; was taken to Kuwait as a baby, and raised in Kuwait. Now she was a college senior, and she said, \u201CAnd I don\u2019t belong to any of these places. And I feel so adrift. And I\u2019m not accepted in any of these places.\u201D And I said, \u201CMy hope for you would be that you could find a way to live, a way to be, a voice to use, where you feel at home in all of them.\u201D And I think there is a way to do that. As readers and writers, we find a certain home in books and language and literature, that \u2014 like, I hear a Mary Oliver poem, and it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve been her neighbor because I\u2019ve read so many of her poems, even though I\u2019ve never spent a day in her town. Maybe one day, some time. But so we abide with one another. We find through images ways to be together. So my hope for that girl was not that she would feel alienated forever from all her places, but that she could find a way to be so much herself and let those parts of herself continue the dialogue through writing or through whatever she chooses to do. But I do think writing would really help in her case. Would help her to feel an identity. So, your Palestinian refugee father, you say \u2014 and this comes through over and over again \u2014 but as you wrote about him, at the end of his life, after he died, you say, \u201CHe loved the world. The world frustrated him endlessly, but he loved it and he hoped for it.\u201D Yeah. There\u2019s this beautiful line, \u201CHe never gave up hope. Everything depended on mutual respect. The sadness of my father was a land mass under water.\u201D I wanted to ask you about the substance of hope for you. Oh. Thank you for asking that. Right now, living in Texas, it\u2019s spring, and everything is bursting forth. I mean, things we had even forgotten we planted, things we don\u2019t remember the derivation of \u2014 where did that come from? All these things are popping up and bursting open, and the air smells very sweet with this wonderful tree we have down here called Mountain Laurel. And there\u2019s kind of an intoxicating feeling of spring opens up, like, all these flowers open their faces to the sky. And then we have the amazing fields and fields and miles and miles of wildflowers in Texas. And just that sense of return, restoration, energy coming back out of the soil. And so I think the gift of daily life, which is our treasure as long as we live, hopefully there are days with all their simple tasks and errands to be fulfilled, but also moments of apprehension that are greater than those tasks and errands, or moments of apprehension that come through those tasks. And people used to ask me a lot when I was younger, \u201CWhy do you write about common things? Normal, like regular little things?\u201D And I said, \u201CWell, what do you have in your life? I mean, I\u2019m not living like in Star Trek. I have common things in my life. What else do I have?\u201D But I don\u2019t think that the things are themselves common. I think it\u2019s a miracle that anything works. I\u2019ve been thinking about Flint, Michigan a lot these days. I think about the miracle of plumbing a lot and all the mysteries we don\u2019t see under the soil. The pipes, the wires, the wireless connections now. I mean, just thinking about everything that\u2019s going on, kind of like when you\u2019re a child fascinated by all the stuff that\u2019s going on inside your body, and you didn\u2019t have to tell it to do that. Like, I used to think my stomach is \u2014 I\u2019m digesting right now. I didn\u2019t have to tell it to do that. It just did it. That\u2019s incredible. Or the heart beating, or the blood rolling through the veins. And you think, wow all this stuff goes on. That\u2019s not commonplace to me. That\u2019s miraculous. It\u2019s amazing. And so writing is a way that we\u2019re continually \u2014 continuously restored to that. And reading other people\u2019s work, being restored to that. How could you ever feel too old or too dull in a world like that?

I loved his voice. We had a record of him singing. And I wouldn\u2019t read his biography until I was an adult and know about what he suffered as a so-called communist, and how his passport was taken away from him. And he was not allowed to leave the nation, though he had a huge fan club in Europe and elsewhere. So I thought this was so funny when he did this. And I now own a CD of this concert. Oh, really? Yeah. Someone sent it to me. I don\u2019t know, some archival recording. Pretty amazing. Wow. \u201CCross That Line.\u201D \u201CPaul Robeson stood on the northern border of the USA and sang into Canada where a vast audience sat on folding chairs waiting to hear him. He sang into Canada. His voice left the USA when his body was not allowed to cross that line. Remind us again, brave friend. What countries may we sing into? What lines should we all be crossing? What songs travel toward us from far away to deepen our days?\u201D"
