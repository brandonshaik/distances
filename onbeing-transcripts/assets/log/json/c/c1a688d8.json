  "fullText": "God met me in an apartment in Stamford, Connecticut watching TV. I wasn\u2019t praying in church before a statue of Mary, saying, \u201CPlease make me a priest.\u201D I was tired at the end of the day, a terrible day, had just finished a bowl of spaghetti that I\u2019d heated up, and I was watching PBS. [laughs] And that\u2019s where God met me. Because that\u2019s where I was. And so that\u2019s where we need to meet people: where they are. That\u2019s where Jesus met people. He meets everybody where they are. And that should be our model too. Before Pope Francis, Fr. James Martin was perhaps the best known and loved Jesuit writing in American life. He\u2019s followed the calling of the founder of the Jesuit order, St. Ignatius of Loyola, to \u201Cfind God in all things\u201D \u2013 and in 21st century forms, as editor of America Magazine, but also as a wise and witty presence on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. To delve into Fr. Martin\u2019s way of being in the world is to discover the spiritual exercises St. Ignatius designed to be accessible to everyone more than six centuries ago. These underpinned the Jesuit way of \u201Ccontemplation in action\u201D and are now shaping the Vatican in a new age. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. James Martin has been a member of the Jesuit order, the Society of Jesus, since 1998. He lives in the America House Jesuit Community in midtown Manhattan. He grew up in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. And he\u2019s the author of many books including The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything, Jesus: A Pilgrimage, and his new book, Seven Last Words. I spoke with him in 2014. Of course I\u2019ve known about you and kind of read you for years, and it was fun to dive in. I did not know the part of your story that \u2014 because you are known as a religious figure, it didn\u2019t surprise me that much that you didn\u2019t grow up especially religious or grow up to be religious. But I did not realize that you studied business in college and worked in corporate finance for GE into your mid-20s. And only then were captured, it seems, by Thomas Merton. Is that right? Was that really what the big turning point was for you? It was. I grew up, what I say, in a lukewarm Catholic family. That doesn\u2019t mean my parents weren\u2019t good people or Catholic, but we weren\u2019t super Catholic. I certainly never thought about being a priest, or I didn\u2019t know what a Jesuit was. And I went to The Wharton School of Business from 1978 to 1982 and got a degree in finance. We were told finance, not finance. It\u2019s much more prestigious. I\u2019m glad I learned that at this late stage in my life. Yes. And I took a job with GE, General Electric, in New York. And I worked for GE, in finance and accounting and then in human resources at GE Capital, their financial services arm, for six years before I figured that this was just not the right place for me. And I came home one night, and in the midst of a lot of confusion about my future, I turned on the TV and saw a documentary about Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, who I\u2019d never heard of. And the documentary was so compelling that it prompted me to go out and read his book, The Seven Storey Mountain, which, to coin a phrase, changed my life. It\u2019s pretty amazing, the number of really interesting Monastics in particular who were led down that path by Thomas Merton\u2019s book, The Seven Storey Mountain. Isn\u2019t it? I mean, you must have come across that. Oh, dozens. So many\u2026 Yeah, here\u2019s a book written in the \u201840s that still speaks to people. And I think \u2014 for those who don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, he\u2019s a sort of a lost young man who lives a fairly dissolute life. Born in France, studies in England, finally comes to Columbia University, and stumbles on the Trappist monks and finds his vocation and enters. I also noticed that you found his book No Man is an Island important because I\u2019d say that\u2019s the book that kind of crossed my path at a moment where I was opening my mind to all of this in a new way. And it was really transformative. And somewhere in one of your books, you pull out this first paragraph of No Man is an Island: \u201CWhy do we spend our lives striving to be something that we would never want to be, if only we knew what we wanted? Why do we waste our time doing things which, if we only stopped to think about them, are just the opposite of what we were made for?\u201D Yeah, that\u2019s the line that changed my life, really, and I just thought, \u201CWhy? Why am I doing that?\u201D And it felt like he was speaking directly to me. And I felt like \u2014 business is a real vocation for a lot of people, and it just wasn\u2019t for me. And I was miserable, and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know how I could find a way out. And that sentence, which really was like a thunderbolt, just prompted me to shake things up and ask myself that question. And I always say to young people, \u201CWhat would you want to do if you could do anything that you could do?\u201D It\u2019s a very clarifying question for people. And Jesus asks people that. \u201CWhat do you want?\u201D Kind of understanding your desires. So yeah, I love that paragraph. I go back to it a lot. I think something that really runs through all your writing is that callings and vocation as opposed to a mere career is not something that\u2019s restricted to monastics. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Or priests or sisters or brothers. Everyone has a vocation. I mean, the most fundamental vocation is to become the person whom God created. And it\u2019s both the person you already are, and the person that God calls you to be. And I think we find that out through our desires. What moves us? What touches us? What are we drawn to? Part of that\u2019s career, but only part of it. I mean, it\u2019s really who you are called to be, and that\u2019s why that question really spoke to me. But yeah, there\u2019s a popular misconception that having a quote/unquote \u201Cvocation\u201D means that you have to be a priest or a sister or a brother. But a vocation is your deepest identity, and as well, being called to married life, or being a lawyer, or a teacher. Being a parent I think is a vocation. Absolutely. And a much harder vocation than being a priest, frankly. We don\u2019t get up at 3:00 in the morning for feedings. Well, you don\u2019t get any of that training. You just \u2014 you\u2019re plunged into it. No, we do not. I mean, I love the use of the word \u201Cdesire,\u201D because again, I think if we do separate \u2014 if we do think about vocation or calling in kind of narrow spiritual terms, which sounds very serious, then we probably wouldn\u2019t use that language of desire that it does \u2014 that has to do with your desires. And in fact, being in touch with them is one kind of compass, but in fact, there is a very long and deep philosophical and theological tradition of thinking about desire and calling. Yeah. And you know, I\u2019m a Jesuit and our founder, St. Ignatius, in his classic text, The Spiritual Exercises, talked about praying for what you desire and also praying to understand your desires. What are your deepest desires that moves you? Because I believe that your deepest desires, the things that you\u2019re drawn to, the person you\u2019re called to be, are really God\u2019s desires for you. I mean, how else would God call us to something? You\u2019d think of a married couple. That\u2019s the easiest example. They\u2019re drawn to each other. And that you would ask them, \u201CDo you feel drawn to each other? Do you feel God drew you to one another?\u201D They\u2019d say, \u201CSure.\u201D Well, how does that happen? Desire. Physical, emotional, spiritual. It\u2019s the same in different jobs. It\u2019s the same in religious vocations. But it\u2019s also the same in the person you desire to be. I think we all have an image of the person we want to become \u2014 more loving, more open, more free. That\u2019s a call. That is God calling you to become that person. And it starts with desire, which I think is so beautiful. It\u2019s helping people understand that and recognizing it, that in a way that \u2014 to tell them it\u2019s not selfish. A desire ultimately is not selfish. Yeah, it\u2019s freeing, and it opens the possibility that this, not necessarily, is easy, but is a process that has joy in it. And delight. Yeah. And heartache sometimes\u2026 Yeah, of course. \u2026as we let go of the things that we\u2019re not called to be, and the parts of our lives that are keeping us back. I mean, this comes up again and again in direction. In spiritual direction? People, they see who they are before God. Yeah, in spiritual direction. They see who they are before God, and they feel the sense of wanting to, in a sense, move beyond that and become someone different. And I always tell them, this is good. This is God calling you. This is a process. And it\u2019s ultimately liberating, which is a great message for people. So, spiritual direction is an example of something, like contemplation in Christianity, that for a long time was kind of consigned to experts, monks and nuns, professional religious people. But I do think that St. Ignatius of Loyola, who\u2019s the founder of your order of the Jesuits, was a kind of exception to that rule of keeping these things for specialists, and that\u2019s something that I think people are rediscovering also through you at this moment. Well, I hope so. You\u2019re right. The Spiritual Exercises and spiritual direction in that practice is at the heart of Jesuit spirituality or Ignatian spirituality. And you\u2019re right. Ignatius meant that for everyone. And that got him into a lot of trouble when he was alive in the 16th century. He liked to say that the Creator could deal directly with the creature. So that God can deal directly with us through prayer, through our daily experiences. And spiritual direction is basically helping people see where God\u2019s activity is happening in their lives, mostly in their prayer, but also in their daily lives. And I do a lot of spiritual direction with a lot of different kinds of people. And it\u2019s beautiful to see how God is at work in people\u2019s life, and it\u2019s a real grace to be able to do that. It kind of increases your own faith too. But you\u2019re right. Ignatius meant that for everyone because God deals with everyone directly, even though people sometimes aren\u2019t aware of it. It\u2019s just a question of inviting them to notice it, to be aware of that, and to kind of awake to that. So how would you begin to talk about the distinctives of Ignatian spirituality? Probably the shortest way of describing it is finding God in all things. And the idea is that God is not simply to be found in our prayer life, which is very important, or in worship services and Mass or in reading the Bible. All those are important and at the center of that kind of spirituality. But in your daily life, in your relationships, in your work, in the emotions that come up, in those moments that you see a sunset and you say, \u201CMy gosh that\u2019s so beautiful. Why am I feeling like this?\u201D Or you see an infant for the first time, like your niece or your nephew or your son or your daughter or granddaughter or grandson, and you say, \u201CMy gosh, where are these feelings coming from?\u201D And these are ways that God has of communicating with us through our daily lives in all things. And then the second way we look at it is being a contemplative in action. So, we\u2019re not monks. We Jesuits are not monks. We\u2019re out in the world. And yet we have that contemplative stance towards everything, so that every moment is an invitation to encounter the living God who wants to encounter us. So it\u2019s a beautiful spirituality. It\u2019s very kind of spacious, and it fits people, and it\u2019s user-friendly. I\u2019m directing a young man through The Spiritual Exercises right now, and it\u2019s wonderful to see how his life is changing. And I have other people who are spiritual directees, as they\u2019re called in the trade, and it\u2019s just beautiful to see. That\u2019s Ignatius\u2019s great gift to the world. The Jesuits\u2019 great gift is not our schools and our high schools, as wonderful as they are. It\u2019s Ignatian spirituality and The Spiritual Exercises. So, it\u2019s life changing. Like, for somebody who\u2019d never experienced it, there\u2019s this imaginative, visual aspect, which is very accessible. Yeah, so the kind of prayer you\u2019re talking about is often called Ignatian contemplation, or Ignatius calls it \u201Ccomposition of place.\u201D And it\u2019s using your imagination to place yourself within a scripture scene and to see what comes up by way of emotions or feelings or desires. And it can be very transformative. So for example, you take a simple passage like the storm at sea, Jesus calming the storm at sea. You would ask the person, on your own or maybe in a guided meditation, \u201CImagine yourself on the boat with Jesus. What do you see, first of all? What\u2019s the boat look like? What do the disciples look like? What\u2019s Jesus look like? What do you hear? What are the waves like? What do you feel? You feel the cold water on your back? What do you smell? Is there a smell of fish? What do you experience in terms of like what you\u2019re wearing?\u201D And you basically trust that God\u2019s going to be with you \u2018cause God created your imagination, and it\u2019s an entr\u00E9e into experiencing God. And you notice what happens. And oftentimes, not always, some pretty amazing things can come up. For example, you see Jesus asleep in the boat. And you start to realize, \u201CWow, why is he asleep? Doesn\u2019t he care?\u201D You might connect it with something in your own life. You know, \u201CWhy is Jesus asleep? Why does God not care about me right now?\u201D You see him do the miracle and still the storm, and you say to yourself, Wow, that\u2019s really beautiful. Are there times in my life where I was worried that God was asleep, and things worked out OK? Do I need to have more trust?\u201D So, those kinds of feelings can come up. Just something as simple as \u201CI\u2019m angry at God for being asleep\u201D can lead you into an encounter with God or a conversation with God, which can be very healing for people. So, it\u2019s not for everybody. Not everybody likes it. Some people like more content-less prayer like centering prayer, which is just kind of quiet. But it\u2019s the primary way I pray, and for most people, it\u2019s really transformative. It\u2019s kind of interesting as I hear you talking about it. It\u2019s kind of like a contemplative, visual Christian form of midrash, right? Jewish midrash\u2026 It is. \u2026 which is about kind of reading between the lines in order to understand the words better. Well, also, yeah. You also notice things that you would have not noticed. Right. I did a meditation with a group a year or two ago, and it was the multiplication of the loaves and the fishes. And in one of the stories, where Jesus multiplies the loaves and the fishes and feeds the crowds, there\u2019s a little boy who brings five barley loaves and two fish. And this one woman in this group I was facilitating said, \u201CI never noticed that little boy.\u201D She said, \u201CI\u2019ve read this story probably hundreds of times and heard it at Mass, and I never knew he was there.\u201D And she said, \u201CI spent time just looking at him and noticing how he was able to bring what little he had to Jesus.\u201D And that was her insight. I mean, I\u2019ve been a Jesuit for 26 years now, and that\u2019s happened to me dozens and dozens and dozens of times. And I\u2019ve heard it in direction. And I\u2019ve heard it from my other Jesuit brothers. And it\u2019s astonishing. I mean, the gospels become your own. And it\u2019s great. I mean, you feel like you get to know Jesus, and that\u2019s the goal of Ignatian spirituality in the end. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Jesuit writer and spiritual teacher Fr. James Martin. Tell me what you mean when you say and when you write, \u201CThe way of Ignatius was about finding freedom.\u201D How are you using that word? Well, Ignatius wanted us to be free of anything that kept us from following God. He called them disordered attachments. And the idea is that if anything keeps you from being more open to God\u2019s will in your life, get rid of it, basically. A simple example: when I was a Jesuit novice, the first part of the Jesuit training, I went to my novice director \u2014 and we were supposed to be assigned to different ministries working with the poor the first year of our novitiate. And I said, \u201CWell, you know what? The last thing I want to do,\u201D I said, \u201Cis work in a hospital. I don\u2019t think I could stand that, the smells and the sights and the sounds.\u201D And he said, \u201CWell, good. Then you\u2019ll be working in a hospital.\u201D And why\u2019s he doing that? It wasn\u2019t to punish me. It was to kind of free me up from that. So his insight was, which is a very classic Jesuit insight, if that is something that\u2019s going to be preventing you from meeting people and from doing your ministry, you need to let go of it. And the way to let go of it, in this case, was to kind of experience it. And now I can go into hospitals. And imagine a priest who was so unfree that he couldn\u2019t set foot in a hospital, or a Jesuit who couldn\u2019t do that. So is that this concept of agere contra? Yes. \u201CTo act against,\u201D which at the end of your book, The Jesuit Guide to Nearly Everything, you said in this interview you wished you\u2019d written more about that. And I think that\u2019s what you just described, isn\u2019t it? That sometimes, in fact, we have to act against our instincts to do what we actually really want to do. Right? Yeah, yeah. So, agere contra, \u201Cto act against\u201D is exactly that, and it\u2019s a way of freeing yourself up. And it can sound kind of masochistic, but it\u2019s basically \u2014 it\u2019s confronting those fears, not simply for the sake of confronting them, to kind of show how strong you are, master them, but to let go of it. Ignatius wanted us to be free. There\u2019s so much, I feel, in Ignatian spirituality that is just so resonant with now, in a moment which I think is just profoundly historic in that for the first time in centuries, if not ever, human beings are not inheriting their belief system anymore. And the six paths to God, as you lay them out \u2014 belief is one of them. But the others are very familiar: disbelief, independence, return, exploration, confusion. Yeah, and that\u2019s just based on my experience with people. That\u2019s where they are. In trying to accompany them \u2014 and I was on all those different paths at one time or another in my life. And there are a lot of people who do grow up with a very strong belief system and are born into a family that\u2019s very religious or very spiritual. But even those people, I find, in their 20s and 30s often break off. They have to kind of re-appropriate it. But you\u2019re right. People are coming at it from different points of view, and I think that one of the strengths of Ignatian spirituality is that it meets people where they are. It says, \u201COK, you\u2019re starting to be interested in God because of a book you read. Great. Let\u2019s start there. Let\u2019s start with your reading.\u201D Or, \u201CYou\u2019re interested in God because of some movie you saw, and it made you moved. Fine, let\u2019s start there. What\u2019s your experience of that movie? Let\u2019s talk about that.\u201D That\u2019s very Ignatian. And it\u2019s just very open because, again, it\u2019s finding God in all things. So you don\u2019t say, \u201CWell, because you weren\u2019t in church when that happened, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201D You meet the person where the person is. That\u2019s where God met me. God met me in an apartment in Stamford, Connecticut, watching TV. . I wasn\u2019t praying in church before a statue of Mary, saying, \u201CPlease make me a priest.\u201D I was tired at the end of the day, a terrible day, had just finished a bowl of spaghetti that I\u2019d heated up, and I was watching PBS. And that\u2019s where God met me. Because that\u2019s where I was. Right. And so that\u2019s where we need to meet people: where they are. That\u2019s where Jesus met people. Jesus met people where they were. He didn\u2019t sit on his butt all day in Capernaum. He sat on his butt a little bit, and people came to him, but most of the times, he went out. And he met people where they were. \u201CIf you\u2019re fishing, I\u2019m going to go to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Follow me,\u2019 and I will make you fishers of people. I\u2019m going to even use a phrase from your argot, basically.\u201D So it\u2019s terrific. He meets everybody where they are. And that should be our model too. Tell me what it means for you to have a Jesuit now on the throne of St. Peter. It\u2019s hard to put into words. It\u2019s great. I think the most exciting part is seeing him invite people into Jesuit spirituality without even using those words. I mean, he very rarely \u2014 he\u2019ll, at times, advert to St. Ignatius Loyola or The Spiritual Exercises, but he just does it in his own way. I think it was a year ago, at his Easter Mass, he started talking about imagining yourself on Easter Sunday morning, running with the women to the tomb. It was a kind of Ignatian contemplation. He said, \u201CImagine what it would be like.\u201D And I was watching with my mom at my sister\u2019s house with her family, and my mom said, \u201CDo you think he read your book?\u201D [laughs] And I laughed, and I said, \u201CYou know, this is Ignatian spirituality. And so\u2026\u201D We read some of the same books. Yeah. And in other times, he\u2019ll say, \u201CNow close your eyes, and let\u2019s imagine ourselves in this scene.\u201D And he will do what\u2019s called a guided meditation, where you kind of invite the person into the scene imaginatively. It\u2019s all Ignatian spirituality. And so to be able to see this kind of on a worldwide level is just beautiful. And I just love the guy. I mean, I think his emphasis on the poor is fantastic. I think \u2014 meeting people where they are. And frankly, I think the key to understanding him is his Jesuit background. I mean, here\u2019s a guy who is free, who does not have disordered attachments. And imagine if someone was so attached to having to do things the way that they were done. For example, like living in the Apostolic Palace. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s free of that. \u201CI don\u2019t have to do that.\u201D Right. \u201CI\u2019m free of that.\u201D He\u2019s free of the shoes as well, isn\u2019t he? Yes, he\u2019s free of the shoes. And in all seriousness, imagine if he had said, \u201CI must continue to do this.\u201D Ignatius would say, \u201CAre you being free? What do you really need? What\u2019s necessary?\u201D And it\u2019s beautiful. I find him very inspiring. He makes me want to be a better Jesuit, a better priest, a better Catholic, a better Christian, and a better person. So, across the years, I\u2019ve interviewed a fair number of Jesuits. And they\u2019ve been really different people. They\u2019ve been astronomers, they\u2019ve been social activists\u2026 You know the old expression, \u201CIf you met one Jesuit, you\u2019ve met one Jesuit?\u201D No, I did not know that. But I was going to say, the one thing they all have in common is they\u2019re funny. OK? Really. You have all had a great sense of humor. Well, I hope so. I mean there are a few unfunny Jesuits. [laughs] Well, I\u2019m sure there are. But, let\u2019s say more serious. But I would hope the part of that is perspective. One of the things that the spiritual exercises and Jesuit formation teaches you is that you are not perfect. The beginning of the spiritual exercises is actually an encounter with your own sinfulness, which is not to make you feel terrible about yourself, because we\u2019re all God\u2019s creations, but we\u2019re all human beings. We all have sins. We all have flaws and failures and things like that. And that\u2019s very humbling to be able to see that about yourself, and I think that gives you a lot of perspective. And it means that you can laugh at yourself. My spiritual director always likes to say, \u201CThere\u2019s good news, and there\u2019s better news.\u201D Do you know this, by the way? Have you heard this? No, no. \u201CThe good news is there is a messiah. The better news is it\u2019s not you.\u201D Yeah. So, it\u2019s not all up to you. And you will come up, and I come up against my sinfulness, and my flaws, and my struggles daily. I really do. And I don\u2019t mean that as, like, false humility. That is true. And that keeps you humble, I think. And I think that means you can laugh at yourself. And most Jesuits are pretty good at laughing at themselves. Well, I mean, I agree with the last part of that, that I\u2019ve met a lot of Jesuits who are good at laughing at themselves. I mean, it can cut both ways, though. You\u2019ve pointed out \u2014 you\u2019ve written a whole book about joy, and laughter, and humor, and you said \u2014 and I think we can all identify \u2014 \u201CI\u2019ve come across a surprising number of spiritually aware people who are, in a word, grim.\u201D And that joylessness is \u2014 it\u2019s ecumenical, interfaith\u2026 Yeah. The frozen chosen. The frozen chosen. Yeah. But you\u2026 But\u2026 Go on. No, I was going to say that it\u2019s also very un-Christian. I mean, the ultimate message of the gospels and of Christianity is \u201CChrist is risen.\u201D That\u2019s the end of the story. And that\u2019s a joyful message. I always laugh at people who say, \u201CJoy is really \u2014 not too much joy, not too much happiness.\u201D And I say, \u201CImagine the disciples on Easter Sunday. Do you think they were going around with long faces?\u201D And Jesus himself lived a joyful life. You can see signs of that in the gospels in terms of his clever parables and his funny stories. And for Pete\u2019s sakes, his first miracle was at a party, a wedding party. Where he was a good boy and did what his mother told him to do. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I appreciate about that story. Although, he\u2019s pretty harsh with his mother. That\u2019s a great story. But he did turn the water into wine. He did eventually. If he\u2019d been thinking about his legacy, he might not have had that as his first miracle, but his mother asked him to do it. I never thought of that. He wanted another first miracle. I\u2019m doing an Ignatian, you know \u2014 I\u2019m being in the story. And I\u2019m taking\u2026 You know what? And you know what\u2019s great about that, what you just said? Who knows, that could have been it. I mean, that\u2019s one of the things that comes up in Ignatian contemplation. You focus on Mary, and you say, for example, in the wedding feast at Cana, \u201CWhat is she thinking?\u201D And you can get into the story and say, \u201CWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201D So yeah, who knows? But yeah, he\u2019s a joyful person. And I think if we miss the joy in Christianity, we are missing the point. You can listen again and share this conversation with Fr. James Martin through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, I\u2019m with the beloved Jesuit writer and teacher Fr. James Martin. He follows the call of the founder of the Jesuit order, St. Ignatius of Loyola, to \u201Cfind God in all things.\u201D He brings the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius to diverse modern people \u2014 and offers spiritual wisdom in diverse 21st century places. I spoke with him in 2014, during the final season of the Colbert Report on which Fr. James Martin made several appearances. And you happen to be the Chaplain of the Colbert Nation, according to Stephen Colbert himself. Yes, well, until the show ends. Well, no, but here\u2019s the question I wanted to ask you that I know everybody will be wondering about, if you\u2019ll preside over his installation at The Late Show. I always say, if he invites me, I will come. I am free enough. Plus, funny enough, it\u2019s like two blocks away from my Jesuit community, so. I do pay attention to language and how a lot of the words that we most need get a little bit messed up in the way they get used. I feel like the way you\u2019re talking about joy and laughter and humor \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly the way we use the word \u201Chappiness.\u201D I mean, I just \u2014 seems to me it\u2019s kind of like the difference between hope and optimism. Yeah. I mean, I think that joy is different than happiness. Joy is happiness in God. Joy has an object. Joy is about a relationship. Happiness can be very evanescent, can come one day and leave the next. But joy is a lot deeper than that. And I\u2019ll tell you something. I had a friend of mine who just died a few days ago. Just this incredible Jesuit. His name was T.J. Martinez. And he died of stomach cancer at age 44. And he, even towards the end, was joyful. And I mean that in the most \u2014 sort of the fullest way. It wasn\u2019t fake. It wasn\u2019t insincere. But he was joyful. Towards the end of his life, he sent me a message through a friend, saying, \u201CThe last six years of my life\u201D \u2014 he\u2019d worked in a school for poor children in Houston called the Cristo Rey School that he founded. Said, \u201CThe last six years of my life have been my best assignment ever.\u201D And he said, \u201CMy next assignment will be even better.\u201D He would send me these texts that were joyful. And so, why is that? Was T.J. happy about having cancer? No. Not at all. But he was in a relationship with God, and he had this trust, and he had this experience of joy. And so that\u2019s the difference, I think. This theme of humor as a virtue, and humor as a kind of mark of God, also is something that\u2019s run through my life of conversation. And I think it\u2019s just most profoundly embodied in Desmond Tutu, who first of all just again embodies it. He just\u2026 Yeah. We\u2019re drawn to people like that. And the people who are most in touch with God are those who are joyful and vice versa. I was walking up Madison Avenue the other day. I live in New York. And I was \u2014 sometimes you overhear these snatches of conversation. And these two guys, these two young executives, were talking, and the one said, \u201CYeah, I\u2019ve got to meet my girlfriend\u2019s mother this weekend. She\u2019s really religious.\u201D And I thought, that doesn\u2019t sound like a compliment. Versus, like, Pope Francis, or Desmond Tutu, or the Dalai Lama \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re religious, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re terrified to meet them. And it is, I think, a fundamental misunderstanding of how we view God, and for the Christians, how we view Jesus. Because we have viewed Jesus as the man of sorrows, primarily. And you go into a Catholic church, my denomination\u2026 All those depressing\u2026 Well, you see Jesus on a cross, which is very important, I always tell people, but that is a part of his life. Most of his life was, needless to say, not on the cross, and not about suffering. And so he\u2019s the man of joys too. And you see statues of the saints, and they all look ticked off. They all look like they\u2019re mad about something, or they smelled a piece of bad cheese. And what that does is it subtly influences how we see holiness in our own lives. Because if Jesus and the saints were morose and dull, and overly pious, and as Pope Francis said, look like they went around sucking on a lemon, then we\u2019re like that too. And as a result, we think that when people are joyful and happy, they\u2019re somehow not religious or they\u2019re not serious. Right. And I did this book on joy and humor and laughter. I was stunned to find the number of books on humor and laughter and the Christian tradition are \u2014 maybe fill, like, half a shelf because it\u2019s not seen as important. Now, you go to the Christian section of your library, and look up \u201Csuffering.\u201D Well, there you go. And you can read from now until kingdom comes. Yeah, I know. But also, here\u2019s where you get \u2014 there\u2019s a difference between \u2014 I think there\u2019s just a lot of \u2014 religious jokes, I think, don\u2019t tend to be very funny, but that\u2019s not the same as humor. Oh, really? Do you know what I mean? I don\u2019t know. I know some pretty great religious jokes. Oh do you? Well, another time. Another time. Let\u2019s see if we have time at the end of this interview. You can tell some. Sure. Yeah, sure. To me, this does touch on something I wanted to ask you about. Something you\u2019ve said that the way you think about friendships can help you think about and deepen your relationship with God. Absolutely. And it\u2019s usually the most clarifying way for people to start to think about a relationship with God. And the idea is that a friendship is an analog with a relationship with God. So for example, what makes a good friendship? What is required? Well, time, for example. You would scarcely say, \u201CI\u2019m good friends with this person,\u201D and never spend any time one-on-one with him or her. Well, what about your relationship with God? Do you spend one-on-one time with God? Is there time? How about honesty? You know what happens if you\u2019re not honest in a friendship. Well, it starts to grow cold or formal or very distant. Same with God. If we\u2019re not honest in prayer about what we feel about our struggles, our anger, our sorrows, our relationship gets very cold and distant. How about listening? If you had a friend that all you did was talk at, that wouldn\u2019t be a very deep friendship. Can you listen to God\u2019s voice in your daily life and in your prayer? So this is an insight from Father William Barry, who\u2019s a Jesuit in New England. And it\u2019s been very helpful for me. And it really helps people, because it really gets their spiritual life kind of back on track. Can you relate to God in a similar way that you relate to a friend? Time, honesty, openness, silence. Are you comfortable with silence? Does your friend have to call you every day and say, \u201CI like you?\u201D Right. Or also companionable silence. Right? Yes. Just the being able to \u2014 the people you\u2019re closest to, you don\u2019t have to be talking all the time, or have them talking to you. Yeah. I always use the example of, if you\u2019re quiet with God in prayer \u2014 this is sort of the, I would say, the opposite of Ignatian contemplation, centering prayer, which is just \u2014 centering prayer is just being in the presence of God, simply put. Can you imagine that, like, taking a long walk on a beach with a friend and saying nothing? I mean, is that any less of a relationship or relating than if you\u2019re talking over a dinner? No. It\u2019s just a different way of relating. There\u2019s no right way to pray or a wrong way to pray. That\u2019s another great insight of Ignatian spirituality. Whatever helps you feel closest to God is great. You write in a very winsome way about being monastic and being a modern person and also not in a tell-all way, but I think you are revealing, and you\u2019re writing to a broad audience. So, it\u2019s taken by a place in one of your writing where you say that when you were becoming a Jesuit, you said you\u2019re not monastic, right? Is that right? Am I getting that\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not a monk. You\u2019re not a monk. But it is a monastic order. Right? Well, no. No, not really. Or is it technically not? So there are monastic orders, which would be cloister and living in monasteries. But we\u2019re more \u2014 religious order is kind of the broader term. OK. OK. Yeah, sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been getting that wrong. That\u2019s OK. I didn\u2019t know that before I entered the Jesuits. Yeah. Well, I guess I was conflating religious orders and monastic orders. Yeah. That\u2019s OK. But anyway, so that when you were becoming a Jesuit, someone said to me, one of your teachers or mentors said, \u201CYou will fall in love,\u201D right? \u201CYou\u2019re taking this vow of celibacy, but you will fall in love.\u201D And you said you did fall in love. And I think that that\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s important for people to hear, to humanize this way of life that you\u2019ve chosen. And that many other people of great integrity have chosen across time. Yeah, I also think it\u2019s important for people to hear. I think \u2014 when you enter the religious order, you don\u2019t check your sexuality at the door. You fall in love. And my novice director said, \u201CAnd if people don\u2019t fall in love with you, something\u2019s wrong because you\u2019re living a loving life, and we\u2019re human beings.\u201D And actually, I was horrified. I thought, \u201COh, my gosh, what if I fall in love?\u201D Not that love is a bad thing, but this would be terrible. And I did. I fell in love in a very deep way, and I had to make a decision. My spiritual director at the time, which was really helpful and human and real \u2014 and I\u2019ve had this experience with people coming to me \u2014 said to me, \u201COK, you fell in love, and it\u2019s beautiful. And someone fell in love with you, and that\u2019s beautiful too. And now you have to make a choice. Do you continue with this way of life, which is about chastity, and loving people freely and deeply, but not exclusively\u201D \u2014 that\u2019s how we say it, not just one person \u2014 \u201Cor do you choose to leave and continue this relationship with this person?\u201D So I chose to stay after looking back on my life and seeing how happy I was as someone who was living in chastity. So I thought it was really important to put that in the book. Because it\u2019s true, first of all. It was an experience of discernment. But it\u2019s also, as you say, kind of dispels these notions that people don\u2019t fall in love. I mean, and it happens to married people. Right, right. To people who are already in a committed relationship. And it\u2019s kind of the same thing. It\u2019s \u2014 OK, now what do you do? Now you\u2019re given a choice. What do you do? It was a gift to me in the end. I mean, it was very turbulent, obviously. But it was a gift to me because it was beautiful to fall in love and have someone fall in love with you. But it was also a gift of discernment, and it also helps me understand people. As does, by the way, on a more practical level, just having worked, made it much more, kind of, simple level. I mean, just being out in the world and earning a paycheck. So, I tend to think that it\u2019s better for priests and religious people and religious orders to have those experiences before they enter, so that when someone says, \u201CMy boss is a jerk,\u201D you don\u2019t just say, \u201COh, well, you must pray for him or her.\u201D Right. Or, \u201COffer it up.\u201D Right. You know? You can \u2014 you know what that means. Or, \u201CI\u2019m struggling with my paycheck.\u201D Or, \u201CI\u2019m worried about losing my job.\u201D Or, \u201CI\u2019ve fallen in love.\u201D Or, \u201CI\u2019ve fallen out of love.\u201D Or, \u201CI\u2019m having an affair.\u201D It\u2019s important to understand \u2014 Jesus became human, right? Jesus participates in humanity, and so we\u2019re called to participate in humanity. And I always say to people there\u2019s a reason Jesus didn\u2019t come down as a book. I mean, he came down as a person. He incarnates himself. And so we\u2019re called to kind of identify and participate in people\u2019s lives like that. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with Jesuit writer and spiritual teacher Fr. James Martin. So you\u2019re very active on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram as well. Is that right? Mm-hmm. And so I just would love to hear how you think about St. Ignatius of Loyola\u2019s call to find God in all things and how that works for you in social media, in these 21st century places where we congregate. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that Pope Paul VI said to the Jesuits, I think, was that you are to be found on the boundaries all the time, on the margins. And Pope Francis said that to us. And so we\u2019re called to be on the boundaries, and this is where people are. And so I have this public Facebook page, and Twitter account, and Instagram, which I\u2019m new to. This is where people are. So if you want to\u2026 Well, I think \u2014 yeah, one in six people on the globe now is on Facebook, I heard recently. So it\u2019s not even margins anymore. Well, that\u2019s true too. That\u2019s a good point. We\u2019re on the margins here in public radio. OK, let\u2019s be clear. That\u2019s funny. Well, at least Instagram is on the margins. OK. Instagram\u2019s on the margins. But, no, that\u2019s where people are. And I actually see it as kind of a ministry. I really do. I work at America Magazine, which is a media ministry of the Jesuits. And so we\u2019re kind of a clearinghouse for things. So, I try to mix it up in terms of evening meditations, and prayers, videos \u2014 not my own, but other people\u2019s \u2014 articles, and to just show people the riches of the faith and to help them a little bit. And the number of messages I get from people about their gratitude for being able to find something on my page is really beautiful. And I love it. I really enjoy it. And by the way, it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of time. Just maybe half an hour to an hour a day. I mean, a lot of it is kind of cleaning up the comments, which are kind of crazy. But it\u2019s great. And then every morning, I tweet out a 140-character homily for people just for the heck of it. And I always say to people \u2014 well, I won\u2019t say who \u2014 this person came up to me after mass and said, \u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really appropriate that you are tweeting, and you\u2019re kind of denigrating the gospel.\u201D And I looked up all the Beatitudes, you know, \u201CBlessed are the poor\u2026\u201D They\u2019re all under 140 characters. And I tweeted them out one day just to kind of show people that you could say things with substance in less than 140 characters. Jesus did, and so why shouldn\u2019t we? But really, the point is, that\u2019s where people are. And so why not go where they are? Mm-hmm. So, we\u2019re talking around Christmastime, and I\u2019m actually not a big Christmas person, mostly because I just have been so discouraged by what\u2019s happened to it, what we\u2019ve done to it. Well, that makes two of us. And it\u2019s not even \u2014 I mean, the commercial thing is part of it, and the compulsory gifts, and all that. But it\u2019s also, even in churches, the story itself doesn\u2019t have its fullness. I just wanted to ask you\u2026 Well, I do \u2014 I think it\u2019s been tamed. It\u2019s not only been commodified and commercialized; it\u2019s been tamed. It\u2019s a nice, pretty story about two nice, good-looking people, usually white, had a pretty baby in a manger. But in a sense, it\u2019s a terrifying story in terms of what they had to undergo. And it\u2019s also \u2014 I have to say \u2014 it is a shocking story. It\u2019s not just a baby. It is God being born in human form. And it\u2019s just as shocking as the resurrection. And I think we\u2019ve tamed it. And in a sense, it doesn\u2019t demand our belief. We can just kind of look on it, and say, \u201CWell, that\u2019s cute.\u201D But if you say to people, \u201CDo you believe that that is God incarnate in that stable? What does that mean for you, that God comes to us as the most helpless being that you could imagine, sort of crying and wetting his pants and needing to be nursed? What does that say to us about who God is for us, and how God is for us, and how much God loved us to do that? And that, I think, is an entirely different story than the kind of Christmas-card-y stuff that we see. So we set it aside. And I actually have to say, I am really getting to the point where I\u2019m starting to loathe the Christmas season. The commercialism makes me \u2014 I saw Chris Rock recently on Saturday Night Live. He was talking about Jesus\u2019s birthday season. And he says, \u201CYou know what? We have taken the person who\u2019s the least commercial person who\u2019s ever lived, and turned his birthday into\u201D \u2014 and he said not just his birthday, but there\u2019s a whole season around it. It\u2019s what we do with Jesus and the saints. Right. All of these characters are like Thomas Merton, who we talked about at the beginning. What was that? What\u2019s the phrase you used about him? Wonderfully complicated \u2014 full of wonderful contradictions. But fully human, messily human. As Merton said, for me to be a saint means to be myself. And I remember in the novitiate, there was a young novice who would get up in the morning at 6:30 and pray all the time. And I thought, \u201CWell, gee, to be holy, I guess I have to do that.\u201D So I\u2019d get up, and I\u2019d pray, and I was falling asleep all the time. And then there was another novice who was super quiet, so I thought, \u201COh, I have to be really quiet, and diffident, and sort of soft spoken.\u201D And my spiritual director said to me, \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re so quiet.\u201D I said, \u201CWell, so-and-so\u2019s quiet. And he\u2019s really holy.\u201D And he said, \u201CIn order to become holy, you don\u2019t become someone else. You just become yourself.\u201D So, there\u2019s a sense that we forget that the saints were themselves too. And Jesus was himself. We tame them, take all the rough edges off of them, and we put them on a pedestal. And then they make no claim on us because we say, \u201CWell, we can\u2019t possibly be like that. We can\u2019t be perfect like they were without any rough edges. So therefore, I don\u2019t have to be a saint. I don\u2019t have to try.\u201D And that\u2019s what happens. And that\u2019s how we let ourselves off the hook from the call to holiness. Fr. James Martin is a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America Magazine. His books include Jesus: A Pilgrimage, The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything, and most recently, Seven Last Words. Do you have any jokes about Dominicans, Benedictines\u2026 Oh, my gosh, are you kidding? I\u2019ve got like 100 of them. OK, so you said some of them were good, so tell us one that we would universally\u2026 Well, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t tell you my bad ones. I\u2019m not going to tell you the bad ones. A guy is trying to find some help with a problem he has. So he knocks on the door of a Dominican church, and he says, \u201CDo you say the rosary here?\u201D And the Dominican says, \u201CYeah.\u201D He says, \u201CYou know, we\u2019re Dominicans.\u201D And he says, \u201CIf I give you a little donation, will you say a rosary for an intention I have?\u201D And the Dominican says, \u201CWhat\u2019s your intention?\u201D And he says, \u201CI want a Lexus.\u201D And the Dominican says, \u201CI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201D And the guy says, \u201CWell, forget it. I\u2019ll go to a Franciscan church.\u201D So he goes to a Franciscan church, knocks on the door, guy opens up in his brown habit. He says, \u201CWill you say a rosary if I give you a donation and if I tell you my intention?\u201D And the Franciscan says, \u201CSure. I\u2019m happy to do that. What\u2019s your intention?\u201D And he says, \u201CI want a Lexus.\u201D And the Franciscan says, \u201CWhat is that?\u201D And he says, \u201CForget that.\u201D So he says, \u201CI\u2019ll go to Jesuits.\u201D So he knocks on the door, guy opens up, and he says, \u201CAre you a Jesuit?\u201D \u201CYep.\u201D He says, \u201CListen, before I go any further, I need to ask you something.\u201D He says, \u201CDo you know what a Lexus is?\u201D He goes, \u201CDo I know what a Lexus is?\u201D He says, \u201CHalf my parishioners drive Lexuses. Or Lexi.\u201D And he says, \u201CWill you say a rosary for my intention if I give you a little donation?\u201D And the Jesuit says, \u201CYeah. What\u2019s a rosary?\u201D OK that\u2019s\u2026 I literally have about 50 of those jokes, so. All right, well, I\u2019m glad I asked. Hear Fr. James Martin tell another joke and read a beautiful prayer by Thomas Merton in my unedited interview with him. That\u2019s always part of our weekly podcast.
