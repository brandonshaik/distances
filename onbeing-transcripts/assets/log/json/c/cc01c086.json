  "fullText": "She\u2019s known affectionately by her fellow scientists as \u201CHer Deepness.\u201D The oceanographer Sylvia Earle earned this nickname in 1979. That year, she became the first \u2014 and still the only \u2014 person to walk solo on the bottom of the world \u2014 on the ocean floor \u2014 under a quarter mile of water \u2014 600 pounds of pressure per square inch. She\u2019s watched humanity\u2019s enduring fascination with \u201Couter space\u201D; while she has delighted in \u201Cinner space\u201D \u2014 the alien and increasingly endangered worlds beneath earth\u2019s waters. These frontiers, as Sylvia Earle points out, are our very life-support system. She takes us inside the knowledge she\u2019s gathered there in her 76 years. That\u2019s the joy of being a scientist and explorer. You do what little children do: you ask questions. Like who, what, why, when, where, how? . And you never stop and you never cease being surprised. It\u2019s just impossible to be bored. And you\u2019re still diving, aren\u2019t you? Well, yeah. I breathe. So I can dive. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This is On Being \u2014 from APM, American Public Media. Sylvia Earle is a marine biologist and botanist, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, and former Chief Scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In the course of her career, she has led more than 100 expeditions and logged thousands of hours underwater. In 1970, she led an historic team of all-female \u201Caquanauts,\u201D as they were called, living for two weeks in an enclosed habitat on the ocean floor. When I interviewed her this year, she\u2019d just returned from a dive in Panama. Sylvia Earle spent the first part of her childhood on New Jersey farmland. Then her father moved the family near the ocean \u2014 to Clearwater, Florida \u2014 to take a new job. I want to tell you, I know I had heard of your work, but I was listening to the BBC in the middle of the night which I do sometimes and you were on a program and you have the most beautiful voice. I\u2019m sure people have told you that, but if you hadn\u2019t been an oceanographer, the radio person in me as much as the person who\u2019s fascinated by what you do just wanted to be talking to you and get you on the radio. Well, thank you. I\u2019m a fish whisperer . Great, OK. So it\u2019s clear to me that you discovered the natural world in general and water in particular and the ocean in your earliest life. I mean, this seems from as far back as you can remember to have been part of you and your imagination. Um, a critter person. Children generally start out that way, given a chance to explore even in their own back yard. So often, the adults around them will say, oh, don\u2019t touch that beetle or, ugh, an earthworm, or caterpillars, yuck. My parents were different, especially my mother who was known as the bird lady in the neighborhood because any injured creature, not just the birds, found their way to her doorstep. We almost always had a hospital for small injured animals in motion and they mostly recovered too. She had a way with all kinds of life, including children, myself included. And then eventually you actually moved to Florida and you were on the ocean. Yes, the Gulf of Mexico was my back yard from the age of 12 onward and I still regard it as my back yard, laboratory, play place. Lovely. Was there a spiritual background to your childhood or a religious background to that passion that your mother had for nature? I think there is a basic ethical attitude, respect for life, respect for other humans certainly, but for all forms of life. It\u2019s something that if everyone could just realize how special it is to be alive on this little blue speck in the universe. It\u2019s a miracle that life exists at all and that we have a piece of time that is ours, whoever we are, shorter or longer, whatever it is, but to really be a part of the action and to respect where we have come from, where we might be going. And from my parents, I think I derived an attitude about wanting to make sure that whatever it is that we do, we try to leave the place better than we found it or at least as good. My mother used to come into my room and remind me that I should try to leave a place better than I found it . My father would watch me try to take things apart. It was my inclination to see how things worked. He reminded me that we should remember how to put things back together again when you take them apart. Try not to lose any of the pieces. I\u2019ve taken that to heart over the years just looking at what we generally are doing to the planet. We don\u2019t know how to put things back together again. We certainly are good at taking things apart and we have lost a lot of the pieces. Right. So I want to go through a bit, you know, your journey of knowing what you know, but also just this sense of discovery that I have all the way through. You often talk about this invitation, in the summer of 1964, as one of the moments that literally changed your life. I was a graduate student at Duke on my way I hoped to get a Ph.D. I hadn\u2019t crossed all the T\u2019s and passed all the exams yet, but one of my fellow colleagues at Duke was scheduled to go on an expedition to the Indian Ocean for six weeks. At the last moment, he had to drop out. He was much better qualified than I was to do this. I had never been west of the Mississippi or out of the country, let alone to go to the Indian Ocean. But I was supported by my parents and by my then husband, who I think would like to have gone himself, but he wasn\u2019t invited; I was. I said yes, so I was accepted and it was only when we\u2019re right in the closing, almost hours, of getting ready for departure when I had a call from Ed Chen, who was the chief scientist. He said, you know, it may not be a problem, but you should know you\u2019re going to be the only woman onboard and there are 70 men. I said, \u201COh, I don\u2019t see that to be a problem.\u201D And it really wasn\u2019t. The only thing was that, when I got to Mombasa, our leaping off place to get on the ship to take off on this cruise, I was interviewed among the other scientists. There were 12 of us, and we were asked to describe what we were planning to do. We poured our hearts out about the work that we were hoping to undertake, the explorations among the islands of the northwest Indian Ocean, the diving. We were able to dive there for the first time in many places. The fish were totally innocent of the actions of any human being. We had deep water equipment as well. But the next day, the Mombasa Times headline said, \u201CSylvia sails away with 70 men.\u201D And the subtitle was, \u201CBut she expects no problems.\u201D Actually, the kind of problems I think they were thinking of were not the kind of problems that were there at all. Our real problem was how do you explore the ocean when you\u2019re sitting on the deck of a ship and the average depth of the ocean is two and a half miles, and we\u2019re right there on the surface with these pathetic little tools to try to sample this huge expanse of living blue? I was very struck to read that a scuba, which was then called the Aqua-Lung, had just been invented, I guess, when you were beginning your graduate studies. Yeah, lucky to be among the first to have a chance to try scuba in the United States. There were a couple of units that my major professor, Harold Humm, had secured. They really looked like the most appropriate for U.S. Navy divers with a big mouthpiece and just very basic tank regulator and a weight belt. I had two words of instruction: breath naturally, over the side . But what did that make possible? It sounds like that really opened a whole new world. Oh, it did for me. It has for millions of people now. Now we have been able to see first of all that the ocean is alive. It\u2019s not just water, rocks, water, sand, whatever. It\u2019s a living system with every spoonful that you look at. We think of life in the sea in terms of fish and whales and coral reefs and the like, but most of the action is very small, microscopic and submicroscopic. And that really was kind of new knowledge, I mean, in your lifetime. I feel like a witness to \u2014 I am, to the greatest era of change on the planet as a whole. Anybody who\u2019s been around even for ten years is a part of this, but the longer you\u2019ve been around, the more you\u2019ve seen. The last half century in particular has been a time of revolutionary change. We didn\u2019t know the existence of those great mountain chains, hydrothermal vents, the existence of life in the deepest sea seven miles down. Nobody had been there. Not until 1960 was it possible for two men to make a descent to the deepest part of the sea. You did a very remarkable thing also, one of those milestones, in 1979. This is, I think, at the time that people started to dub you \u201CHer Deepness\u201D . What a wonderful nickname to have. It was called the \u201CJIM dive,\u201D and that\u2019s after the suit, I guess, that made that possible. Is that correct? JIM, J-i-m. You know, Jim is the name of the first person willing to put that one-person diving system on going back to the late 1920s. Jim Jarrett, working with the designer, Joseph Peress, who came up with a way to build a diving suit made of metal. Most diving suits prior to that time were soft suits, so you felt the pressure. But the idea here was to develop something that a person could be inside a system at one atmosphere, no change in pressure from the surface, so no decompression was required. The system had to be strong, of course, like a submarine, but also because it looked like an astronaut suit with arms and legs, Joseph Peress\u2019s breakthrough was to have joints that could move under pressure. But the idea that you had a personal submersible, a submarine that you could wear and walk around, protected from the pressure, was sort of revolutionary. So you actually walked, were the first and still the only person to walk the ocean floor at 1,250 feet without a tether. Back to the surface. There\u2019s a short line connecting me to my companion, that little submarine called the Star II. I rode down on the nose of that little submarine and then I walked off. But there\u2019s a line connecting the communication system from the submarine to me so we could talk and the submarine could talk to the surface, so we had this link back to those who were eager to know what\u2019s going on down there. There is a through-water communication system that worked for the sub, but not for me in the little suit. So what was going on down there? I mean, what did you see when you looked around? When you looked up? My first experiences going through the sunlit area and into what generally is known as the twilight zone, where sunlight fades and darkness begins to take over. It\u2019s like the deepest twilight or earliest dawn. You can see shapes, but not really distinct forms and this begins at about 500 feet. By the time you get down to 600 feet, 200 meters or so, it\u2019s really, really dark. It\u2019s like starlit circumstances. A thousand feet and below, it is truly dark, but still enough light penetrates clear ocean water in the middle of the day and that\u2019s when I made the dive, right about high noon in September. I could see shapes even at 400 meters, at 1,250 feet or so. That was exciting just to be able to realize that glow, that soft glow, was the sky above separated by 1,250 feet of water. But the flash and sparkle and glow of bioluminescent creatures. There were corals that just grow in a single stretch, no branches, like giant bedsprings from the ocean floor. And when I touched them, little rings of blue fire pulsed all the way down from where I touched to the base of these spiraling creatures. They were taller than I; they\u2019re just beautiful creatures. They call them bamboo coral because they have joints that resemble the joints on a bamboo plant. The submarine headlights were on, and I asked them to turn them off so that I could see the darkness and revel in the bioluminescence. It\u2019s that firefly kind of light, but also when the lights were on, I could see crabs that were attached to these large corals that grew on the sea floor. Some were pink, some were orange, some were yellow, some were black. They\u2019re just beautiful. It\u2019s a garden. It looks like a flower garden. And the red crabs were hanging onto these great sea fan-like structures. They looked like shirts on the line. In that little bit of current, they were just, you know, slowly moving. There were eels that were wrapped around the base of the coral. It was just beautiful, really ethereal. And you were down there for two hours? On the bottom, two and a half hours, and I later spoke with an astronaut friend, Buzz Aldrin, and he said, \u201CWell, that\u2019s about as long as we had to walk on the moon, two and a half hours.\u201D But what they did not have on the moon, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong and those who came later, they didn\u2019t have just this avalanche of life, this great diversity all around. Everywhere you looked, there were little fish with lights down the side. Of course, the corals themselves are alive. There were little burrows of creatures that were dwelling in the sediments on the sea floor. The water itself is like minestrone except all the little bits are alive. And, you know, as I hear you talk about that and you made the connection with Buzz Aldrin, I was born in 1960, right? I still remember crowding around the television set with my family and everyone I knew was doing this, when men first walked on the moon. What you did was as remarkable, and it\u2019s not something that made such a sensation. I mean, I know you\u2019ve talked and thought about this a lot, our fascination as human beings with outer space, when as you describe it, there\u2019s this inner space which is even less explored at this point. And keeps us alive, oh, by the way . And keeps us alive . And it\u2019s changing. It\u2019s in trouble and that means we\u2019re in trouble, and we know so little about the ocean. Only about 5 percent has been seen, let alone explored. Anyone looking for new frontiers, think ocean because it\u2019s really important and it is there to be done. I mean, it\u2019s true on the land as well. I had lunch once with Clare Boothe Luce, stateswoman, playwright, you know, just a remarkable human being. This question came up about why is it that people are so smitten with everything that goes up skyward and seem to neglect the ocean and this planet as a whole? This was at her home in Hawaii and there\u2019s some big puffy white clouds drifting by and blue sky. She said: \u201CWell, my dear, it\u2019s actually simple. Heaven is in that direction and you know what\u2019s the other way.\u201D There is something to that. You know, people are uplifted and you think, oh, they\u2019re feeling really down. Our language reflects you\u2019re in over your head. I mean, that\u2019s not a good thing, right? Anyway, it\u2019s bizarre. I mean, light is up and dark is down, but then what you discovered is \u2026 There\u2019s heaven on earth. It just happens to be in the ocean . I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being \u2014 today with a legendary oceanographer, Sylvia Earle. It seems to me that in, you know, the mid-20th century, late 20th century, there was this idea out there that the ocean, of all things, could take care of itself, that it was vast, so powerful, so inscrutable. I wonder, how do you trace your sense \u2014 and I do sense that this evolved, that the ocean is in trouble and much more vulnerable and responsive to human life than I think most of us anywhere realized? Well, it\u2019s not just clear to me. It\u2019s the recognition that we have the capacity to draw down the assets, if you want to call them that, but the populations of wildlife in the sea. There are policies put in place in the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s, and even current policies that seem perversely to be based on the assumption that there\u2019s a large quantity of excess out there that we can extract from the ocean in terms of the number of fish or whales. That there\u2019s kind of a limitless supply, right? Right, and no matter how much we took, it would always regrow. Now we know otherwise because, since the 1950s and in some cases since the 1980s, we have gone from one species after another and drawn them down by as much as 90 percent, in some cases, 99 percent of some species are gone because of our capacity to find, kill, extract and market, consume things such as, well, we already by the 1950s had demonstrated our power to do this with whales. Right now, the number of several of the great whale species is so depressed, they may not recover. Bowheads, a few thousand, some of the smaller dolphins and small whale species. In the Sea of Cortez, the vaquita, a few hundred individuals. In New Zealand, there are two kinds of dolphins that are limited to just a few hundred individuals. So we may be the last to know them. The last seal in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean seal, the monk seal of that area, was seen in 1952. I didn\u2019t know that. I was a child, and I didn\u2019t even know he existed. Imagine seals on Miami Beach or seals in Galveston Bay. They used to go as far north as Galveston, and they\u2019re gone forever. There\u2019s still maybe 1,000 individual monk seals of a different species in Hawaii and fewer than that in the Mediterranean, but that\u2019s it. So this was a critical time. We are at tipping points not just for big, conspicuous species like Goliath groupers and whale sharks and whales, but small creatures that we haven\u2019t even discovered. Many are homebodies, so if you lose a particular stretch of reef, destroy it through dynamite fishing or through coastal transformation for building houses and things, so much has been lost in coastal areas. And you lose their home and they go to \u2026 Well, and their lives. There are habitats with a whole host of creatures that occur there and only there. I read an interview that you gave together with Roger Payne, who you spent some time working with. He and Katy Payne were known especially for studying the songs of whales and understanding how this worked and how, in fact, complex it is. You made this statement in this interview I wanted to ask you about. You said, \u201CFor whatever it\u2019s worth, the songs of the \u201960s\u201D \u2014 you were talking about the whale songs \u2014 \u201Care much more beautiful to human ears than the songs of the \u201970s.\u201D You heard the change between the generations. And now there\u2019s so much sound in the ocean \u2014 something that we were simply not tuned into until fairly recently \u2014 because of shipping, because of seismic surveys, the Navy does testing, even for science in terms of trying to understand the temperature over broad areas of the sea; since sound travels at different rates, depending on the temperature, it\u2019s possible to get some idea of what\u2019s the ocean doing, since the ocean governs temperature, regulates climate and weather and so many things. It\u2019s a valid experiment, but it\u2019s a valid concern about what these pulses of sound so large that they can travel across entire ocean basins, what that might do to wildlife that require sound for their mode of existence. It\u2019s not just marine mammals, although it certainly is marine mammals. It\u2019s fish. It\u2019s crustaceans. It\u2019s life generally affected by the atmosphere of sound in which they live. You have said that, if you could travel back in time, you\u2019d go to the Florida Gulf coast 1,000 years ago. I mean, what would you find if you went there? Well, people ask me sometimes where\u2019s the best place to go diving? I say almost anywhere 50 years ago . Fifty years is a horizon in terms of change, more change truly than during all preceding human history. Here\u2019s the wonderful thing, though. Diving into the ocean is like diving into the history of life on earth not just over the last 50 or 1,000, but the last million, 10 million, 100 million years because creatures are there that have been there for several hundred million years. Not the same creatures, but their near relatives like jellyfish. Well, sharks have been around for 300 million years. Horseshoe crabs, creatures that lured me into the ocean as a child in New Jersey, have a history that goes back at least 300 million years. So many forms of life that were found in the ocean long before there were multicellular creatures occupying space on the land. So we talk about geologic time, but there\u2019s also ocean time. That\u2019s right, which is geologic time. You know, it\u2019s just a different way of thinking. Sylvia Earle walked on the ocean floor in a suit that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a science fiction movie. You can see her in the \u201CJIM suit.\u201D Check it out on our blog at onbeing.org. And while you\u2019re on our site, download my unedited conversation with Sylvia Earle and subscribe to our podcast. Find links to all this and more at onbeing.org. Coming up, why running into sharks gives Sylvia Earle great hope; also, why she does not eat fish. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today with marine biologist and ocean explorer Sylvia Earle. In 1979, she became the first person to do a solo walk on the sea floor without a lifeline. This is still the deepest dive, outside a submersible, in history. And it earned her the nickname, \u201CHer Deepness.\u201D We\u2019ve been talking about Sylvia\u2019s Earle\u2019s life of discovery of this vast realm of the natural world that is hidden from most of us. In recent years, she\u2019s led the team of marine scientists providing content for the \u201COcean in Google Earth.\u201D She\u2019s also often called in for counsel in ocean ecosystems after natural or manmade disasters. I know that over the years you\u2019ve been called in to in times of epic catastrophes like the Exxon-Valdez spill, but you\u2019ve also observed what happens to oceans after wars and also are very aware of the accumulated effect of garbage, the great Pacific garbage patch. These are not things that I had really heard of even as, you know, a fairly well-informed person. They didn\u2019t exist until fairly recently. I think one of the reasons I am truly optimistic is that 50 years ago, even 20 years ago, we didn\u2019t know. We did not have the capacity to see, to understand, what we now can see, can understand, about what we\u2019re doing to the life-support system, the systems that keep us alive. Some people call this phenomenon the boundaries that hold the world together, if you will, and make a world hospitable for the likes of us. So now we know. It\u2019s partly because, ironically, the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, gas, to give us the energy in a very short period of time, dense forms of energy that enable us to send rockets into space, that enable us to power submersibles into the sea, and instrumentation that gives us communication. Now we know because of this capacity to look at ourselves with new eyes, but it couldn\u2019t happen had we been powering our civilization on whale oil or its predecessors. It\u2019s only because of this amazing transformation made possible through the energy sources that now, it turns out, are coming back to haunt us. No, that is ironic. But now we know, so we can use the power of knowledge. I mean, it\u2019s all very straightforward, but it gets complicated when you think about the politics. That\u2019s the problem. Well, it does. So I\u2019m wondering how what you know \u2014 what are some of the most direct and basic forms for ordinary people to take this knowledge in and act on it? We\u2019re told to eat fish now because it\u2019s good for us. I understood that you don\u2019t fish or you don\u2019t each much fish. So tell me about that. How might we think differently about that simple eating habit? Well, the first thing that I suggest that people should do is, first of all, get informed, get up to speed. I mean, everybody has access to information on a scale that is just breathtaking compared to what was available even 10 years ago. We can download Google Earth, we can look at the ocean in Google Earth and dive beneath the surface. We can connect the dots. We can see wars and we see the impact of wars on the other side of the planet and what that does to water. Second, look in the mirror. Whoever it is you are, you have some kind of talent. The first starts with knowing, but do you have a way with music? A way with numbers? Are you a lawyer? Do you have some insight into policy? Do you have any position in office? Are you a mom? Are you a teacher? Are you a dad? Are you a fisherman? A communicator? Use your power. Artists use their power. Jackson Browne has written a song that talks of, if you could be anywhere in time, it would be now. Why? Because this is the time. Ten years? Fifty years? We may have lost the chance to save bluefin tuna because starting in the \u201970s, we started to consume bluefin and other tunas at a scale that is unlike anything that they or any other creature in the ocean has ever known. We\u2019ve drawn down the large fish and many of the small ones too on the average of 80 percent, sometimes 90 percent, in some cases 99 percent. There\u2019s still a chance as long as some of them are there. Ten percent of the sharks are all that remain from when I was a child. I\u2019ve read that you really enjoy swimming with sharks. Is that right? Well, I go to Wall Street sometimes, yeah . Washington, D.C.? Oh, yeah. We used to think of sharks as bad guys, like the only good shark was a dead shark. And man-eaters \u2014 they used to tell me to watch out for the man-eaters. I said, well, I don\u2019t qualify. You don\u2019t have to worry about man-eaters. Women are safe. Actually, sharks have to worry about humans eating sharks. We consume millions of sharks. Shark-eaters. Yeah, we\u2019re shark-eaters. You know, if 50 people a year get bitten by sharks, that\u2019s big news. Consider the number of shark deaths that we cause every year. Maybe as many as on the order of 80 million sharks are taken, largely for shark fins for the soup. That\u2019s a new taste \u2014 not new in China, but newly accessible globally now. There are people who consider it a luxury, a delicacy, to eat sharks who never would have dreamed of doing this even 10 years ago, let alone 50 or 100. I mean, clearly there are people who survive on fish, but if you \u2026 Not many. Not many. I was going to say, would you like for people stop eating fish based on what you know, if they could survive? Well, for your own health, you should know what you\u2019re eating. When you get served catch of the day or fish and chips, you have no idea what kind of fish it might be or where it\u2019s been swimming or how old it is. Most people are not aware. They\u2019re not like chickens that can go to market from egg to adult to your plate in maybe six or seven months, maybe a year. But even little fish like herring take about three years to get to maturity. And a big fish like tunas, according to Barbara Block, who studies bluefins in particular, but many other forms of life in the sea as well, 10 to 14 years for maturity. They can live to be 20 or maybe even 30 years if left in the sea. Orange roughy, a creature that is new on the menu in the last 20 years or so, because they occur in deep water, we never fished in 2,000 feet of water before. Like Chilean sea bass, they take a long time to mature. For Orange roughy, it\u2019s on the order of 30 years. And that little fillet on your plate that may cost, you know, $8.95 a pound in your local supermarket, more than that in a restaurant, but nonetheless, may take 100 years. They can live to be it seems on the order of two centuries like some whales. A bowhead whale maybe as much as two centuries old. So there\u2019s not great efficiency in feeding ourselves with life from the sea that takes so long to grow. The few fish that really are good choices, I think, are catfish, tilapia and the variations on the theme of carp, the plant-eating creatures that sunlight plants protein and they grow fast. They taste good. Do you eat those? I don\u2019t, but for those who really want fish or even for an efficient way to get animal protein, it is better than chicken to raise catfish and tilapia. It\u2019s very fast and very efficient and in closed systems. I\u2019m Krista Tippett with On Being \u2014 today with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle. I don\u2019t want to finish before noting another piece of social change, evolution if you will, that\u2019s happened in your lifetime. I mean, you did mention at that early expedition you were the one woman and there were 70 men. It\u2019s so interesting looking through, reading you and reading about you, you know, with the headlines that accompanied you through your life. \u201CBeacon Hill housewife to lead team of female aquanauts.\u201D Or after you were the first person, the first human being, and still that same only human being to walk at that depth on the ocean floor, \u201CBrave mom\u2019s historic dive to the bottom of the world\u201D . How was that, being a mother raising children while doing all these amazing historic things? Well, first of all, they didn\u2019t seem amazing nor of historic consequence at the time. I guess time will tell just how. It\u2019s a funny thing about life, isn\u2019t it? It just happens, but I think these headlines like \u201CSylvia sails away with 70 men,\u201D I think the real turning point probably came in 1970 when I applied to participate in the underwater living experiment that was taking place in the U.S. Virgin Islands called the Tektite Project. I had already been diving in many places around the world by that time, and it didn\u2019t occur to me that women would be excluded, and it didn\u2019t occur to some other women who applied as well. They just didn\u2019t even bother to say that it was just for men. When applications came in from women that had qualifications on a par with the men, the decision had to made. Shall there or shall there not be women? Jim Miller \u2014 who was the head of the program, who I think had a really good relationship with his wife and probably had a really good mom \u2014 he had a decision to make and he said: \u201CWell, half the fish are female, half the dolphins and whales. I guess we could put up with a few women.\u201D But, you know, again back to the living underwater experiments and being referred to not as aquanauts \u2014 the women were referred to as aquababes and aquabills and even aquanaughties . I mean, it\u2019s just astonishing, but we didn\u2019t care what they called us as long as they let us go, and they did fortunately. Here\u2019re some lines you wrote, I believe, similar to how you described to me what it was like to walk on the bottom of the ocean. You said: \u201CAs I wandered to the area, the sub powering along behind, I concentrated on observing the corals, especially the bioluminescence spirals of bamboo. Why do they pulse with light? Why do they glow at night? How did they and their neighbors survive in the eternal night of the deep sea?\u201D Are you still making discoveries, being surprised, you know, asking new questions like that? Always, always. That\u2019s the joy of being a scientist and an explorer. You do what little children do: You ask questions like who, what, why, when, where, how? And you never stop and you never cease being surprised. You just never stop that sense of wonder. It is fantastic that life exists at all and I revel in just the joy of being out in some wild place or even in my own back yard. Just look at a leaf. It\u2019s an amazing thing what goes on in a leaf, and it happens all the time. And we can breath because of it or because of photosynthesis that takes place there and in the sea. Knowing that, I think it\u2019s just impossible to be bored. And you\u2019re still diving, aren\u2019t you? Well, yeah. I breath, so I can dive . I mean, tell me where have you been recently? What would be an example of what you\u2019re doing now? Well, a couple of weeks ago, I was on an expedition off the coast of Panama to a group of little islands called Coiba, beautiful little offshore islands, reefs, that have been unfortunately heavily exploited by fishing in recent times. I first went to Panama in 1965, and I go back to both coasts. Panama\u2019s one of those blessed nations that has two oceans, and the changes in just the sharks: You used to see sharks all over the place. Now you\u2019re lucky. I feel really so fortunate when I see a shark. It\u2019s a sign of health if you see a shark because the system has to be in pretty good shape to accommodate big predators. The site where the Tektite operation took place in 1970, I was back last year. The reefs are simply gone. They\u2019re not there. The elkhorn and staghorn coral \u2014 it\u2019s like a meltdown. It\u2019s just rubble. And the fish? The scientists who worked on the fish \u2014 I was mainly looking at the interactions between the seaweeds and the fish that tend to munch on the seaweeds, the parrotfish and the surgeonfish and the like. There were about a dozen variations on the theme of grouper, and I saw one variation on the theme of grouper when I went back and very few fish of any kind. It\u2019s just heartbreaking. But the good news is, nature is resilient and places that have been protected in the last 10 years show remarkable capacity to improve. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so pleased to be able to have this interview, to tell people, look, it\u2019s not too late. The things that you can do, that all of together can do to protect nature, to respect the trees, respect the fish, respect all forms of life and realize we\u2019re a part of the action. You know, it seems like we are able to make a connection with creatures we see around us, right? Birds, for example, a prominent example. Right, right. It starts when you talk about being at the bottom of the ocean and there\u2019s this incredible proliferation, this profusion of life and beauty and strangeness. I mean, is mystery a word to use? Is there something mysterious about the fact that there is such beauty and wildness kind of hidden from us? The whole planet is like that. The whole planet, yeah. But, for sure, when you go into any part of the ocean, the kelp forests of California, the coral reefs of the Florida Keys, in Hawaii, anywhere, even in lakes and rivers and streams, you\u2019ll see creatures in a different way. Our atmosphere is air; theirs is water. You know, look at a dragonfly larva. They have a face. Look at a dragonfly adult. It has a face. It\u2019s odd. It looks alien perhaps to us, but if you line up 5,000 dragonflies or 5,000 grouper of one species or 5,000 black cats, you\u2019ll find every one is different and it isn\u2019t just that you can see subtle differences that set them apart. We know that with cats and dogs and horses and kids, humans, every face is really different, but it\u2019s true with all forms of life. I have such fun taking people to the Monterey Aquarium or the Aquarium of the Bay in San Francisco or anyplace, Boston Aquarium, New England Aquarium, whatever, where they can actually see fish swimming with something other than lemon slices and butter. They can actually see them face to face, and I say, OK, now try to find two that are just exactly alike, and you can\u2019t. If you really look, the spots are different, the stripes are different, the position of the eye is just slightly off. It\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it? It is. And the capacity for variation coupled with the common ground that we share with bacteria, with jellyfish, with sponges, with groupers, with cats and dogs and horses \u2014 there\u2019s a chemistry of life that has this capacity for enormous variation, maybe infinite variation. I think it\u2019s a source of endless wonder and something that\u2019s worth using our minds, that special gift that we have. There are other intelligent creatures out there, whales, dolphins, elephants, fish. Some of them are really smart, but they don\u2019t know what we know. They can\u2019t see the inside of a star or the inside of a starfish except some of them maybe to eat them. But we have this power not only to explore, but we can go back in time. We can anticipate far into the future. We can plot a course for ourselves based on intelligence. And the trick is OK, homo sapiens, the smart ones, the wise ones, let\u2019s take advantage of that capacity. Prove it . Yeah, prove it. Let\u2019s put that into action and not just be like the bacteria on a dish that consume everything until they die. We don\u2019t have to do that. I was going to ask you as my final question how this life that you\u2019ve led what you know makes you think about what it means to be human, how that\u2019s evolved? I think you probably just started to answer that question. Well, humans, we are still the same basic creatures that we were 10,000 years ago and before, so that we look at other forms of life and the basic question comes to mind, is it going to eat me? Or can I eat it? I mean, some very basic things or even for other human beings, it\u2019s cautioned because survival is there. So we\u2019re afraid of differences in others, whether it\u2019s other people or other forms of life. But we have that power of knowing, power of judgment, the ability to choose. I\u2019m so glad to be a human and I hope that I will live long enough to see this transition from an accelerating decline of circumstances that do not bode well for the human future or for life on earth as we know it. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re a human too, and I have loved talking to you. We\u2019ll see you underwater someday, I hope. I\u2019d love that. Do you think everyone should scuba dive? Would that be a prescription? Absolutely. Did I read somewhere that your mother started scuba diving when she was 80 or something? Eighty-one, yeah. And she scolded me for not getting her out there sooner, so hear, hear. Don\u2019t scold me. I\u2019m trying to get you out there. If you\u2019re 81, don\u2019t wait any longer .

And as this program goes to air, we are traveling to Istanbul. We\u2019ll be gathering interviews from this place at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East, Islam and democracy. Then for three days on the island of Halki, I\u2019ll be helping moderate a small global gathering of environmental, business, and spiritual leaders. It\u2019s hosted by His All Holiness Bartholomew, the patriarch of the world\u2019s 300 million Eastern Orthodox Christians. Jane Goodall and Bill McKibben will be among those in attendance. And you can travel with us on our blog, Facebook, and Twitter. Find links to all of this at onbeing.org. On Being on-air and online is created by Chris Heagle, Nancy Rosenbaum, Stefni Bell, Anne Breckbill, and Susan Leem. Special thanks this week to National Geographic. Next time, neuroscientist Richard Davidson. He\u2019s renowned for his original studies of the brains of meditating Buddhist monks.
