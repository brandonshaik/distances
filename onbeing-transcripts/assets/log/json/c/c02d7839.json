  "fullText": "Being a neighbor is not just a term. It\u2019s not a geographic term. It\u2019s a moral concept. What does that mean when we think about education? What if we really thought that being of a community, not just happenstance located in the community, was a moral construct about collective responsibility? So what is the responsibility of institutions of higher education for the communities they inhabit? And how do they nurture students as citizens and leaders for the emerging world? These 21st-century questions are evolving the traditional ivory tower. I took them up with two visionary college presidents from two very different institutions at a national gathering of educators. Nancy Cantor is chancellor of a large public university in the Northeast, Rutgers University\u2013Newark \u2014 one of the most diverse institutions in the U.S. Christopher Howard is the first African-American president of an historically white all male school in the South \u2014 Hampden\u2013Sydney College of Virginia. It\u2019s not that a student thinks it\u2019s the right thing, but how can he or she actually be an upstander and try to address it, to be in the world, to bring those values of the civilization right there in the dorm room and the fraternity house or what have you. And it can be just as powerful as what you\u2019re learning in that calculus class or in that political science class. And actually, to tell the truth, there\u2019s a seamless web, when done properly, that runs through all those experiences that makes you a better citizen in the polis. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Nancy Cantor is an esteemed social psychologist, and she\u2019s widely recognized for helping forge a new understanding of the role of universities in society that re-emphasizes their public mission. Christopher Howard is one of the youngest college presidents in the U.S., a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Academy, and a former Rhodes Scholar with an MBA from Harvard. I spoke with them as part of our Civil Conversations Project before an audience at the American Council on Education\u2019s 97th Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. The notion that we collectively are in the midst of an adventure of re-creating common life, public life, the meaning of citizen and leadership is a theme that runs throughout my life of conversation on radio. And I\u2019ve been fascinated in recent years, as I\u2019ve experienced diverse interlocutors reclaiming the language and practice of the citizen scientist, the citizen artist, the language of public theology, just for example. So, it was exciting as I prepared to be here today, to get a glimpse of how you and your institutions are exploring anew the nature of education and civic formation, of education for leadership in civil society amidst 21st-century realities. I want to say just a few words before we plunge into this conversation about the limits I\u2019ve observed just in the language around this challenge, the fact that we seem to need to reinvent our vocabulary alongside our imaginations. I also always rush to add qualifiers when I use the word civility. Because I think it\u2019s made ineffectual by connotations of niceness and politeness. And I hear echoes of this in both of your writing, as well. The critical place of our educational institutions in this work is undeniable. And I\u2019m just delighted to be up here with, in conversation with Nancy Cantor and Christopher Howard. So, Nancy you grew up with a love of dancing\u2026 I did. \u2026and you went to Sarah Lawrence College. You landed there in 1970. And from a civic life perspective, I think 1970 was an interesting time to land on any American campus. So, what I want to ask each of you \u2014 I\u2019ll just start with you \u2014 is if you could tell us a little bit about the earliest roots. You know, how do you trace the earliest roots, the formative experiences of your passion \u2014 and I want to expansively define this as personal and spiritual as well as intellectual \u2014 your passion for the intersection of education and civic/public/common good. So, I actually, for me, would trace it back to growing up in New York City. I took the subway 45 minutes every day back and forth to school. That was an education in public life. And this was, as you pointed out, during a period of women\u2019s movement, anti-war movement, and the civil rights movement. I came from a very socially active family. Those issues were on the table. And we were very involved in the arts, and the arts is a venue always for bringing together extraordinary diversity and extraordinary public life. So, I had \u2014 when you were talking about civility and really injecting it with something more than being nice, for me, all you have to do is remember New York City subways and you know that what public life or civility is about is really not a sugar-coated, laid-back \u2026 It\u2019s in the thick of it. In the thick of it. Right. Exactly. I mean, so, when I think of education, I just think of it as it\u2019s got to be in the world. It\u2019s got to have that messiness. And we shouldn\u2019t be scared of that messiness. So, I very much resonate to the notion that civility is not about covering up, pasting over, whatever the metaphors in our world that \u2014 I think it\u2019s so ironic that we live in this world of tremendous turmoil, indifference, and conflict and we gravitate towards concepts that are covering things. Yeah, or just not big enough, just not big enough. Or just not big enough. Yeah. But I\u2019d say covering things. Yeah. OK, Chris, let me \u2014 there\u2019s so much that jumps out at me in your story, which is remarkable. I mean, it\u2019s very stunning, and you say it this way often, that your great-great-grandfather was considered to be property, and that you are now president of a college, and president of a college that was originally created on a plantation. So, this question to you also, again, how would you trace the roots of your passion \u2014 personal, spiritual as well as intellectual \u2014 for this intersection we\u2019re talking about here today? Sure, Krista. I\u2019m delighted to answer the question and to be a part of this panel, especially with one my heroes here. But I think about the opportunities I\u2019ve been honored to have and have been given. I take that extraordinarily serious, to be, as you said before, five generations removed from a slave, from a chattel. I often say that my great-great-grandfather was no different than the seats you\u2019re sitting on now. That has informed my life coming up as a young person in Texas with parents who grew up working as sharecroppers in the summer, because black people couldn\u2019t get jobs working at a record store or soda shop at that day and age. My father was a veteran of the Vietnam War. My uncle did two tours. They were both combat veterans, Bronze Star recipients. And so, I saw that, those uniforms in my closet as a kid and then I saw a picture of a West Point cadet when I was in the seventh grade, going back to the formative years in your life. So, here I am in Plano, Texas, I see a picture of a West Point cadet and I said I want to be a West Pointer, which is \u2014 I\u2019m thinking about the public sphere as public service as in military service. That\u2019s how I came into this. But I wrote a letter to my congressman. I said \u201CI\u2019m Chris Howard. I\u2019m a good student, I\u2019m a good athlete, you need to get me an appointment to West Point when I turn 18.\u201D He says, \u201CYou seem like a bright young man, but I\u2019m not your congressman.\u201D So, I\u2019d written the letter to the wrong person. But he forwarded it. He says this guy has hope. He couldn\u2019t figure out my address. But I \u2014 so I ended up going to the United States Air Force Academy rather than West Point. And \u2014 not because I wrote the letter to the wrong place, it just worked out better that way. But I was always thinking one to whom much is given much is also expected. And I think about the public sector and citizenry and that whole rubric in terms of what is the obligation that I have, that my family has, that my town has, that we as society have to ensure that we can have a civilization, that we can have a society. So, Nancy, I think you offered an interesting frame for where we are now. There\u2019s an Association for Psychological Science profile of you, and they talked about how you\u2019re revered in that field for your work on how we perceive our social environments, pursue goals, and adapt to changing and challenging social settings. And I think certainly the language of changing and challenging social settings applies to the field of education as it does to many of our fields right now. You\u2019ve also said, along those lines, \u201CPardon me if, as a psychologist, I say that an existential identity crisis\u201D \u2014 you\u2019re talking about an existential identity crisis for education \u2014 \u201Cevery so often isn\u2019t such a bad thing for growth and creativity.\u201D The Sarah Lawrence girl in me. Right. I mean, I do think that it\u2019s instinctive a lot of times to fret about what is difficult and needs fixing and is falling apart and needs reconstructing and we don\u2019t know how to do that. But I like that positive framing of the existential identity crisis that forces us to creativity. Absolutely. So, I think one of the things that we gravitate to too quickly is really the status quo, in all its richness. I mean, that is, we have norms and traditions and tasks and cultures and ways of being that are useful, they\u2019re adaptive. They let us do things by default. But the fact of the matter is default doesn\u2019t always work, right? And default doesn\u2019t always bring everybody to the table. So, you know, maybe again it goes back to the period I grew up in. But it was a period of churning that really put things on their heads. I mean, so the freedom rides really were a way of saying, at least as \u2014 when I was growing up, it was a way of saying, \u201CStop and look and change.\u201D When I think of social psychology, I think of people\u2019s ability to adapt not by accepting, but by pushing back, by a tug-of-war between individuals and environments, between groups. It\u2019s not a placid sort of way of taking things. And if education means anything, it means to cultivate intelligence, to cultivate a social cohesion and a social spirit, to cultivate that civility you were talking about. So, to do that, you have to have an active stance to the world, and that\u2019s the existential crisis in it. Questioning is, of course, at the heart of education, it\u2019s at the heart of learning. But it\u2019s not just questioning because you can have the answer, it\u2019s questioning itself as a process is good, good for us. And we got a lot of questioning to do right now in the world. You know, Nancy, when I was teaching at the University of Oklahoma in the honors college, we had \u2014 I\u2019d like to say we had a great books class \u2014 it was more great paragraphs. We didn\u2019t read the whole book, but we read really important paragraphs. But we wrestled with the great conversation of civilization. We really put it in the \u2014 I love your word churn. It was a blender, it was a beating up of ideas. And we had people coming from all different political backgrounds and a very intimate learning environment, a very liberal education experience on a public university campus, and we questioned what we valued and we respected each other. And it was a very, very civil place for us to disagree. And so \u2014 to your point \u2014 I just wanted to, just to indemnify and support your point to saying that the classroom, the institutions of higher learning, have a unique opportunity to do what you just described. Exactly. Well, and this may seem like a simple point, but sometimes it\u2019s worth saying the simplest things \u2014 our educational institutions are the places in the society where we learn to ask good questions, where we cultivate that particular skill. But I guess one thing I would push back on that is that when we say that, we often think of the classroom in a cloistered sense. Right. You know, that you have to step back from the world to ask good questions, to be able to do the civil conversation we\u2019re talking about. I think the real task right now is to do that in the world. Right. So that the classroom becomes the world, the world becomes the classroom. I mean, that sounds so clich\u00E9, but it\u2019s \u2026 Right, no, but I guess what I\u2019m saying is also to \u2014 but to send students out into the world who are good askers of better questions. But send students out when they\u2019re still students\u2026 OK. \u2026is what I\u2019m saying. We had a board meeting recently and I had a board member say something about our athletic program. And he said that basically a lot of the learning in student life can happen in the athletic program when done properly. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 to your point, Nancy \u2014 have to be in the wonderful, wood-paneled, cloistered room. Things \u2014 and the tools out there that weren\u2019t as evident, at least even when I was student at the Air Force Academy in the late \u201980s, early \u201990s, experiential learning, service learning. Yeah. They\u2019d been around, but I think they\u2019re much more a part of our vernacular. I\u2019ll add one other piece. What you\u2019re hearing now about getting it right in student life, which is a proxy for the real world, was a proxy for civilization \u2014 is just thinking about upstander versus bystander, right? So, how do you get someone to \u2026 What\u2019d you say? \u201CUpstander\u201D? Upstander as opposed to being a bystander. Right. It\u2019s sort of intuitive. But a lot of times things are happening on a campus. And it\u2019s not that you, that a student thinks it\u2019s the right thing, but how can he or she actually be an upstander and try to address it, to be in the world, to bring those values of the civilization right there in the dorm room and the fraternity house or what have you. But that\u2019s something that\u2019s relatively new and it can be just as powerful as what you\u2019re learning in that calculus class or in that political science class. And actually, to tell the truth, there\u2019s a seamless web, when done properly, that runs through all those experiences that makes you a better citizen in the polis. Exactly. And, you know, we have to teach ourselves and our students that we\u2019re real people. We forget that. Well, and also there\u2019s a line in the academy. It\u2019s hard, right? There\u2019s a boundary that has prevailed\u2026 There is. \u2026and that\u2019s \u2026 And we got to push against that boundary. Again, it\u2019s about the status quo. Do you take that boundary as a given or do you say we\u2019re in a seamless relationship in the world? Right. We have a phrase in Newark of saying that anchor institutions, universities as anchor institutions, are not just in their community, they\u2019re of their community. Right. So, my favorite quote on that, and it\u2019s very much what Chris is saying, was from Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who gave the speech right before Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington. He was a great rabbi in Newark at the time. And he said, \u201Clook, being a neighbor is not just a term. It\u2019s not a geographic term, it\u2019s a moral concept.\u201D What does that mean when we think about education? What if we really thought that being of a community \u2014 not just happenstance located in the community \u2014 was a moral construct about collective responsibility? It wasn\u2019t just that you happened to be there geographically. It was that you were interdependent with community. I mean, when we talk about issues of race or ethnicity or class or gender, sexuality on campuses and how hard it is to adjudicate that conflict, why do we always think about doing it in and of ourselves? Why don\u2019t we do it in community and of community, so that we can see the different faces of these issues? I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a live civil conversation on higher education and civil society. I\u2019m with Rutgers University\u2013Newark chancellor Nancy Cantor, and Christopher Howard, the president of Hampden\u2013Sydney College of Virginia. Chris, I want to talk a little bit \u2014 you are in such an interesting place from which to be observing and participating in this. The slogan of your college is \u201CForming good men and good citizens since 1776.\u201D Exactly, right. Which you can\u2019t beat. But what an interesting perspective you have as the first African-American president of an all-male school, and an all-male school that is predominantly white. Yes. And in some ways, even the \u201Call-male\u201D part of it feels as old-fashioned as anything else. So, talk to us about what you\u2019re learning and also how \u2026 Yeah, it is a wonderful opportunity. It is an extraordinarily American place. It has literally \u2014 it was November \u2014 you took a year off \u2014 November 11, 1775 was when the first classes were offered at Hampden\u2013Sydney College, and it has traced the arc and trajectory of American history, because it\u2019s been there during the American Revolution. We had two or three students that perished in the American Revolution, because the school is actually older than America. And it\u2019s gone all the way through the Civil War, and both the World Wars, and the Civil Rights Movement. And then to have a president who happens to look like me leading a place that happens to be predominantly white. So the arc of progress \u2014 and Dr. King\u2019s, you know, \u201Cthe arc of history bends toward justice.\u201D And I guess I\u2019m justice. I guess just call me justice. But \u2026 It\u2019s kind of a big responsibility. That\u2019s a very big responsibility. But nonetheless that is a \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful thing about America because, you know, I didn\u2019t choose myself. The wonderful ladies and gentlemen on the board who are coming from, primarily, a very Southern tradition saw this as an opportunity. So, I love that aspect. I just want to say that \u2014 the ceremony took place at the Commonwealth Club in Richmond, Virginia. A club which, for most of its history, had only admitted whites and you\u2019re standing before a portrait of Jefferson Davis. Yes. And a board member said, \u201CDr. Howard, you do know you\u2019re standing in front of a picture of Jefferson Davis as you accept the presidency of Hampden\u2013Sydney College?\u201D I go, \u201CIt\u2019s OK. I said hello to Robert E. Lee on the way in.\u201D So, it\u2019s not a problem for me. But that\u2019s, I mean, that\u2019s who we are. I mean, you\u2019re talking about \u2014 it\u2019s not easy, Nancy \u2026 Right. Well, and the fact that they chose you says something about who they are and who they want to be as well. I think so, I think so. And, again, I\u2019m such a humble part of this whole thing that is America. I mean, it\u2019s sort of a clich\u00E9, Krista. But I love this clich\u00E9, that \u2014 we talked about my origins, the origins of the institution. And that we can remake our self and redo our self and have these existential crises that Nancy has pointed out. You know, so much of your life is dictated by your zip code. And what kind of society or citizenry or civilization can we have if you can just say you come from this zip code, ergo your life is going to end up at name the top institution, name the top job or whatever, perceived job, what have you. What does that mean for those that are not in? And I like what Nancy said. She\u2019s coming from a public university. I\u2019m coming from a private institution. We have common cause here. You talk about the common place, the commons. I love those terms. We have common cause here, because if we don\u2019t do it right, if we don\u2019t extend ourselves, if we don\u2019t get uncomfortable, it\u2019s not going to change. It\u2019s never going to get better. So, would you say \u2014 I just have to say, as we\u2019re speaking on it, I\u2019m really curious about what you\u2019re all thinking and what you\u2019d like to ask. So, we\u2019ll just talk for a few more minutes up here and then we\u2019ll open it up. I wonder if, before we do that, if you would both say a little bit about what you\u2019re involved in in your institution, how you\u2019re being able to apply this vision in your very different contexts. So, why don\u2019t you start, Chris? Sure. I\u2019m happy to. So, again, we have the luxury of being sort of older than America and we have a lot of the luminaries of American \u2026 The burden or the luxury. The burden and the luxury, right? It\u2019s like the president of William and Mary said \u2014 Taylor Reveley, whose father ran Hampden\u2013Sydney and actually segregated \u2014 integrated it, excuse me \u2014 but he had said the best thing about William and Mary is they\u2019re, like, you know, 400 years. The worst thing about William and Mary is they\u2019re 400 years old. So, you know how that goes. Right. But we have an institute center at Hampden\u2013Sydney College called the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest. Yeah, I noticed that. This is interesting, Krista. So, leadership in the public interest. And this guy Sam Wilson was a guy who, at age 16, went to \u2014 when Churchill gave his famous speech, the call to armor for Britain, this guy walked ten miles \u2014 you can\u2019t make this stuff up \u2014 walked ten miles or 12 miles and lied about his age, volunteered for the National Guard, ended up being the youngest army officer in World War II, was one of Merrill\u2019s Marauders, went all the way up, became a three-star general \u2014 never went to college. Came back and became the president of Hampden\u2013Sydney College, because he\u2019s from Rice, right down the road. And he pushed for this thing about leadership and citizenry. One our most popular centers, it is the embodiment of a lot of things you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re doing experiential learning, service learning, courses that touch on constitutional law, along with our government and foreign affairs department and it\u2019s just \u2014 our ROTC program\u2019s there. So, the college is predominantly \u2014 at 93 percent white? It was. Was? When I showed up, it was. About 20 percent non-white male now. Really? It was about seven percent when I arrived. You\u2019ve also talked about \u2014 Hampden\u2013Sydney at one point was known as a finishing school for Southern gentlemen. But I really like the way you talk about the word \u201Cgentleman.\u201D You say the operative word is \u201Cgentle\u201D man. Would you talk a little bit about how you \u2014 what that means for you and how you\u2019re implementing that as part of culture? Sure. And I\u2019ll talk a little bit probably about humility as well. So, the term \u201Cgentleman\u201D is problematic amongst many people. It conjures up something that sounds very old-fashioned and you feel like you should have a glass of lemonade and a big, long, white bib and, you know, it just doesn\u2019t quite fly, especially a lot with our faculty members. But this whole idea of a \u201Cgentle man,\u201D which means that you don\u2019t intentionally do something to harm others. So, to walk through life and not intentionally do harm to others is pretty cool. And I think that young men, they can get their minds around that. And so I like that. And the whole idea is that we have these terms that have been around for a long time. How do we come up with a 3.0 or 4.0 version of them? They\u2019re \u2014 some of these things, they should stay in our vernacular. Some of them should be thrown away\u2026 Right, right. \u2026you know, a long time ago. But some of these things should be upgraded, updated and upgraded. And I like doing that with our folks on our campus. And I think the thing about humility \u2014 my last point about humility \u2014 is I talked to my students, and to my two sons \u2014 I\u2019ll say things like, \u201CYou know, I have been 20, you have never been 46.\u201D You know, I\u2019ve seen some stuff that you haven\u2019t seen. So, when we take our respective roles as chancellors and presidents, as parents, as citizens, we got to be humble because there\u2019s so much that we just don\u2019t know. A law of unintended consequences, etc. And so I think that\u2019s a good virtue I guess for us to live by in this wonderful world we live in together. Absolutely. Nancy, I wonder if you would just talk a little bit about the work you did in Syracuse. Which \u2014 I think you\u2019re building that and kind of taking what you learn there to Newark \u2014 but very much kind of a very serious, in-depth, multi-year project and really giving legs to this idea about connecting the educational institution to the world around it. I don\u2019t actually like the word \u201Cservice\u201D learning, because it connotes a kind of one-way street of altruism as opposed to a genuine, collaborative relationship and engagement. But the key phrase is humility. And, let\u2019s face it, universities are not great at being humble, right? This does not come naturally to us. And what we took as principles in Syracuse, and we definitely take in Newark \u2014 although every place is its own, so we do the work differently \u2014 is that our role was to be a collaborator with a community of experts, some with pedigree and some not. I learned more from the wisest grandmother in the ninth poorest census tract in the Near Westside of Syracuse when she said, \u201CNancy, ask us. We lay our head down here at night.\u201D Yeah, so my question was how did you, what was the structure by which you created a relationship so that you were listening to her and she could speak her truth to you? Yes. So, what we did is we created in Syracuse \u2014 in the Near Westside of Syracuse \u2014 a 501(c)(3) through which everything flowed. So, it was heavily dominated by residents, by the local parish priest, who was the best activist on the face of the earth, by business people, by local government, by deans and faculty and students and artists, and residents, residents, residents. They had control. It was democracy in action. It was incredibly messy. What was the 501(c)(3) called? It was called the Near Westside Initiative or the SALT District, for Syracuse Arts, Literacy, and Technology District. A playback to Syracuse having been a salt industry center. The key thing for sustenance and sustaining this work is that we are one of many communities of experts. We are on the ground, one among many. I really believe that the best thing universities can do is create third spaces of collaboration for our students, for our faculty, for our staff and, most importantly, for our citizens. And for everybody around. Places where people genuinely come without pedigree, even with pedigree. And that is not easy. And that goes back to humility. You can listen again and share this conversation with Nancy Cantor and Christopher Howard through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring the evolving place of institutions of higher education in the communities they inhabit, and in nurturing their students as citizens and leaders for the emerging 21st-century world. I\u2019m with two visionary college presidents of two very different colleges. Christopher Howard is the first African-American president of an historically white all male school in the South: Hampden\u2013Sydney College of Virginia. Nancy Cantor is chancellor of a large public university in the Northeast, Rutgers University\u2013Newark, one of the most diverse institutions in the U.S. And we\u2019re with a live audience at the American Council on Education\u2019s 97th Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. Let\u2019s open this up. Here\u2019s a microphone. Thank you. Kevin Snider from Penn State New Kensington. You know, in many societies, some of the societal shifts in civil society come from the students. It\u2019s almost kind of ground up. And here, if there\u2019s a generation of students that ought to be voicing and questioning \u2014 back to your original opening statement there \u2014 you\u2019d think it\u2019d be this generation, where wages are stagnant, the amount that the public is investing in their education is going down drastically and putting a burden on their backs, the benefits they can enjoy when they graduate and get jobs are going to be dramatically reduced. It just seems like they should be rising up more than they are \u2014 voting, demonstrating, things like that. And so, sometimes, when I talk to these students, there\u2019s almost a sense of not even being interested, and I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re doing something wrong. And I\u2019m wondering if you might have some ideas about what\u2019s happening here and what our role should be in this environment? So, to me, there\u2019s sort of two pieces to that. One is if we\u2019re doing something wrong, it goes back to, ironically, in my view, the narrow careerism of our approach. So, we operate from the notion that jobs are hard to get and, therefore, what that then seems to equal is that education has to be narrower and narrower to be better for those jobs, when in fact what we know \u2014 and surveys of corporate leaders all over the country and the world say this \u2014 is that education actually has to be broader and broader to incite and excite the next diverse generation who will in fact turn things around. We know that innovation comes from diversity, and yet we don\u2019t spend the time getting that mix of perspectives that would get the excitement going that you\u2019re talking about. The other quick thing I would say, and then turn to Chris, is that actually I think our students are deeply engaged in the world and want to be. I just think we have to value it. It\u2019s often the faculty and the administration that are pulling back and narrowing the sights of those students. I think that, to your point, Nancy, you see hyper-engagement. But the thing is they engage differently than we did. There was an article in The Economist a couple of issues ago that said that, you know, \u201Cthe death of the protest.\u201D You know, even the Wall Street thing a couple of years ago. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s not like it was in the \u201960s and \u201970s. You think about the Selma march, you mention the freedom buses and what have you \u2014 Freedom Riders, excuse me. That is not the way it\u2019s going down now, even though, as this gentleman pointed out, society \u2014 young people may feel some sort of similar types of pressures on them. So, we have to indemnify, expect, and respect that they\u2019re going about it differently. I\u2019ll make one final point on this. The idea of the citizen sector \u2014 Peter Drucker talked about the citizen sector \u2014 the proliferation of the 501(c)(3)s. First off, that\u2019s a unique thing in America. That you can pretty much hang your shingle and say \u2014 and as long as you convince the IRS and the secretary of state in your state \u2014 I\u2019m going to hang my shingle and I\u2019m going to go after that problem. The number of young people that found 501(c)(3)s, probably because of the technology \u2026 Exactly. That\u2019s a really fascinating point. It\u2019s a very different form that this is taking. But it\u2019s just as vibrant. It is vibrant, and it makes sense for their generation and how they do things. And you know, I\u2019ve sat on the selection committee for the Rhodes scholarship a couple times. And it\u2019s kind of surprising when kids don\u2019t, when they haven\u2019t started a 501(c)(3) than when they have started a 501(c)(3). You know, \u201CHow old are you again? Fifteen, really? When did you start this thing?\u201D So, I just think they\u2019re doing it differently. And so we need to respect that, indemnify that, and support it. Down here. In an age of evidence, what are the metrics around civic engagement that we as leaders can take back out into our communities to talk about success and to talk about \u2014 and to motivate our students to take this as part of their repertoire into the future? Because they\u2019ve experienced the transformation of any particular problem by virtue of applying to it. So, it\u2019s not only about the money-making opportunities. It\u2019s about that satisfaction level and it\u2019s about measuring it for communities so that, once again, as we start to answer the question and compile the metrics around why a college education \u2014 why, especially, a residential college education \u2014 how do we make our case for adding to that civic engagement in a large and very diverse way? So, one of the things that I\u2019ve been doing with young people as I\u2019ve \u2014 either as a mentor when I was in industry, and in the military, and nonprofit, and now as an educator \u2014 is that I want them to have a sense of agency. And you can probably distill in some metrics, but I\u2019m going to be a little bit more spiritual about it. So, when people on our campus, students on our campus want to do something, I like to make sure that our administration, our faculty, our alumni help them do that. Because I want them to know that if they do A \u2014 and it\u2019s not against the law \u2014 that B could happen, right? And I think in terms of civic engagement, stepping into your community, you want people in a school system that\u2019s not working well to run for a school board or to do something to effect change in that school system when they graduated from an institution to make a difference. You want them to do the same thing with \u2014 maybe a corporation as misappropriating land or something like that. You want them to be able to say I can do something about this, or even inside the firm themselves. They can be working for a company and say I want to \u2014 this is not right and \u2014 not out of hubris, but out of responsibility \u2014 make a change. And that\u2019s agency. Agency, agency, agency. And getting that in a more macro level or making sure that we, as a society, are marching in the right direction and knowing that we\u2019re having progress. Probably people that are better at that than I am, but I do know that in my gut that that\u2019s what I want. I want men and women to walk off a campus and be able to know that if they do A, they can have B happen and make it have some input and control. Because a lot of places in the world, people just don\u2019t have that. They simply do not have any sense of agency and they think \u2014 they don\u2019t think they\u2019re ever going to get it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, in a live Civil Conversation on higher education and civil society. I\u2019m with Rutgers University\u2013Newark chancellor Nancy Cantor, and Christopher Howard, the president of Hampden\u2013Sydney College of Virginia. One more question. Here\u2019s one. Michael Galligan-Stierle, president of Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. About 200 universities, a million students around the country. In the short description the sentence read: \u201CA robust civility to bridge rather than deepen differences.\u201D When you look at higher education, what is one experience or model on a university campus that you\u2019ve seen where you actually have robust civility \u2014 conversation \u2014 that helps this generation understand how to build bridges instead of dividing? What does it physically look like in your experience? So, I\u2019ll give you two. I always go back to the arts as a fundamental bridge of civil communication that levels the playing field like nothing else and very quickly. So, in Syracuse we did a project on literacy and photography, again, in that same neighborhood I was talking about, a multigenerational project. And the narrative-making and the voice that came forth from all directions, not to mention the extraordinarily beautiful photography and poetry that was written by kids who are otherwise written off by higher education in communities that don\u2019t get noticed that often, and the integration of Syracuse University students with these kids was an absolute slam-dunk leveler and builder of civic bridges. The second thing I would say is a more formal, typical, if you will, but incredibly important notion of intergroup dialogue. Pat Gurin\u2019s work at Michigan that has been done on many campuses around the country is extraordinary structured intergroup dialogue led by very, very trained facilitators, where vulnerabilities get brought to the table on all sides unexpectedly, and it\u2019s those vulnerabilities, once expressed, that actually create the civic bridge. That\u2019s a wonderful phrase, \u201Cthe civic bridge,\u201D also. That\u2019s a 501(c)(3) waiting to happen right there. That\u2019s right. It is. The Civic Bridge, I heard it first here. That\u2019s my civil infrastructure. So, I would piggyback on what Nancy said in terms of the dialogue piece. And so this, borrowing a note from the faith side \u2014 we\u2019re a Presbyterian university or college, at least those are our roots, and so this comes from a concept that might be near and dear to you as someone who\u2019s coming from faith-based colleges and universities. And this is vocational reflection or discernment. \u201CWhat am I called to be?\u201D And so we have a sophomore vocational reflection project. The last couple of years, from day one, we\u2019ve been asking our students \u2014 literally, the first talk I give to them \u2014 what is your purpose, passion, and calling in life? And the answer is, \u201CI\u2019m clueless,\u201D I say, \u201CJoin the club!\u201D And we\u2019ve been kind of creating exercises and programs that, culminating in their sophomore year, where they have a sophomore reflection dialogue around the table with a trained moderator \u2014 a faculty or staff member. And we also lay on top of the purpose, passion, and calling in life: \u201CWhat does it mean to be a good man\u201D \u2014 or good men, actually \u2014 \u201Cin 2015?\u201D So, this is where being an all-male institution plays to an advantage because we were able to get to a point of vulnerability pretty quickly. So, we did this \u2014 I think, the first time we did it, a group of sophomores had dinner at my house and I was at our table and about ten students were around the table, and had dinner. We went around and I said \u201CWho are you?\u201D And one kid said \u201CI\u2019m weird.\u201D And another kid said that \u201CI want to be Pericles. I want to bring truth to the people.\u201D And went around \u2014 one kid talked about wanting to be there for others. And as the dialogue progressed, one young man talked about his life and coming up in very horrific circumstances in Appalachia America, foster care when his parents died, a sibling who killed herself, drug addiction. I almost want to cry talking about it. So, these young men, who didn\u2019t know each other terribly well \u2014 it was randomly generated, they\u2019re in the same class, were all sophomores \u2014 we\u2019re creating this civic and civil bridge with their own personal experiences and points of vulnerability, just talking around a table over pizza, right? And then we\u2019ve come up with other programs to keep that going. But by the end they were all cheering for each other to be successful. You know, \u201CIt\u2019s OK that you\u2019re weird. And it\u2019s OK that you\u2019ve gone through this, and it\u2019s great that you want to be Pericles. I know what you mean by that.\u201D And so that was a very powerful part. And it speaks to your dialogue piece. It\u2019s very, very useful. I\u2019m in radio, so I know what a hard stop is, and it\u2019s a hard stop. But I\u2019m just going to ask one more quick question. Before I do that, I want to say that another way I think we diminish the notion of civil discourse is we tend to invoke and call for it when things have gotten really bad and when there\u2019s a fight. And I think that robust civil discourse is also about putting words, putting generative, imagination-opening words around things we don\u2019t even quite know how to talk about yet. And there are so many of those right now. And I feel like so many things surfaced in this conversation that I hadn\u2019t heard before. And I do again feel like maybe part of the task is to \u2014 the story you just told, Chris, or your story, Nancy, about creating an experience where people can be vulnerable. These things have civic effect and they shape our capacity to be in the world effectively. And somehow, I think, part of the task is to create that metric-sounding language that can put these things on a different platform. So I want to thank you for this. I guess, just very finally, very quickly \u2014 you know, in my show I\u2019ll often ask at the end through all of the experiences you\u2019ve had and what we\u2019ve been talking about, how have you, how has your sense of what it means to be human evolved? And with this conversation in mind that we just had about education and humanity and connecting who we are and who the world is, both institutionally and personally, how would you answer that question \u2014 what you\u2019ve learned about what it means to be an educated human being. So, I think what I would say is what I\u2019ve learned is to look beneath the surface. That we are so quick to assume we understand what\u2019s there and not to really look for what can be there. And that education is about what can be there. Education is a lifelong process. This is a film, not a snapshot. So, when I was in flight school as an Air Force officer, I had a classmate named Mark and his wife was Kathy. He was an Army reservist. I was an Air Force officer. We were going to Fort Rucker helicopter training. And we would have these long talks about the Civil War and what it meant to society in America and the role of the Confederacy in our history. And he had had relatives that had fought what I like to call the losing side. I\u2019m just saying. They did lose. A point of fact, some of my friends forget that, but nonetheless. But we have these very \u2014 and I\u2019m a trained military guy and so I knew the stories of the Confederate generals and understood where he was coming from. We had these great conversations. And then when we finished up flight school, my wife and our \u2014 we only had one son at the time \u2014 went down to Disney World. We got some pretty cheap tickets off of the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation office at Fort Rucker. We drive down to Tampa to stay with him because we\u2019re going to go to Disney World in Orlando the next day. So, we show up with our four-year-old son. My wife being a colored \u2014 so-called colored, from South Africa, who had grew up in apartheid South Africa, by the way \u2014 we knock on the door. Kathy\u2019s there. She opens the door. Mark\u2019s there. We give them a hug. He\u2019s also a state trooper. We talk for a few minutes. It\u2019s rather late. We go into the bedroom, and on his bed there were a couple of pillows and they were Confederate flag pillows. They were of the Confederate flag. And this is interesting. He takes the pillows and he puts them in a chest, he and his wife, and they make the bed for us, because it was a small apartment. And we stayed in their bed. They stayed somewhere else. It wasn\u2019t that kind of a story. They stayed someplace else. But what was interesting is that I thought that that is the best of a civil relationship, right, in so many ways. I know how some of you are laughing trying to get your mind around this. But think about it though. He did not run and hide that. We talked about what it meant to him. I understood that and I respected that. I didn\u2019t, you know, a lot of people \u2014 it would have turned out very differently if a lot of other people of color had showed up at the door. But it was not that. It was us. It was Mark and Kathy and Barbara and Chris and Cohen and we knew each other. And we took time to respect our respective points of view, which allowed us to have a deep relationship. And so that\u2019s the story that I use. It kind of speaks to some of the things you\u2019re speaking to. And so \u2026 It\u2019s about living with. Living with, living with. Thank you, Chris and Nancy. And thank you all for coming. Nancy Cantor is the chancellor of Rutgers University\u2013Newark. Chris Howard is president of Hampden\u2013Sydney College of Virginia. A note of remembrance this week: Grace Lee Boggs died on October 5 at the age of 100. The daughter of Chinese immigrants, she was a philosopher, a social visionary, a civil rights legend. In recent years, she became a force for renewal against the odds in post-industrial Detroit. She said, \u201COur right, our duty, is to shape the world with a new dream, to rebuild, redefine and re-spirit our city.\u201D We visited Grace Lee Boggs in 2011 at her home in Detroit, and you can hear that conversation on our website, onbeing.org."
