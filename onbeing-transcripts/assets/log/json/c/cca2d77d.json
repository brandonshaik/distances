  "fullText": "A zombie show \u2014 AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead \u2014 is breaking all-time cable viewing records. It\u2019s especially beloved by the young. And it\u2019s about more than zombies. It\u2019s about bodies devoid of souls, and life reduced to survival. As strange as it may sound, television is a place where some great writers and actors are asking big questions of our time. So we\u2019ve once again called up media and religion watcher and TV aficionado Diane Winston \u2014 for a look at the current season\u2019s in-your-face themes of God, meaning, and \u201Cre-enchanting\u201D the world. What are all those righteous criminals, amoral zombies, and loving vampires saying to us and about us? You know the good book tells us that there\u2019s no darkness that the light can\u2019t overcome. So all the darkness that you think you got inside you. Yeah? All it takes is just a little bit of light to keep it at bay. Believe me. I know. Of all the statues in here this is the one that matters the most to me. She\u2019s tall. She\u2019s got a lot on her mind. And I relate. Also, she\u2019s not judgmental \u2014 that\u2019s something I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s irrational but that\u2019s the nature of faith. We\u2019re stealing her. You were never here but since you are \u2014 strap Mary to the dolly and follow me. Two thousand years is enough. Yeah? Our existence is insanity. We don\u2019t belong here. But we are here. It\u2019s not right. We\u2019re not right. You taught me there is no right and wrong, only survival or death. I told a lie, as it turns out. From APM, American Public Media, I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being: \u201CMonsters We Love.\u201D Diane Winston holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. I last interviewed her about TV and parables of our time a couple of years ago. And a lot has changed on the planet and the small screen since. Lost has ended. But its setting of human characters in a supernatural place is turned inside out now in series like True Blood, where vampires, werewolves, and witches make hay in small-town Louisiana. Meanwhile, the protagonists of shows like Dexter, Nurse Jackie, and Breaking Bad \u2014 they turn the meaning of morality inside out. And then there are the zombies. There are people out there who haven\u2019t been in their right minds. People who I believe can be restored. It doesn\u2019t matter if you see them as human beings any more. But if you and your people are going to stay here, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to have to treat them. So let\u2019s just say, the second-season premier of The Walking Dead, which I\u2019m just waking up to, was the highest-rated drama telecast in the history of basic cable, and it\u2019s really breaking records in the 18 to 49 demographic. On the AMC show page, you know, they\u2019re telling the story and then they say this: Instead of the zombies, it is the living who truly become The Walking Dead. Mm-hmm. That\u2019s interesting because a lot of shows have monsters who are monsters, but there are also monsters who are actually human beings in other shows. Who\u2019s to say whether Dexter or Eric in True Blood is more of a monster. And Eric is 1,000-year-old vampire and Dexter is a 21st-century guy who\u2019s watched his mother be killed when he was a child and is a serial killer himself, although he kills bad guys. Right. I mean, I do want to talk about this especially because The Walking Dead is really hitting something for people. I have to say, when we online started telling listeners that we were going to be having this conversation with you and talking about television, we immediately got all these requests to make sure we spent a lot of time with The Walking Dead. And, you know, echoing what you said, people are really talking about it being an example of pop culture theodicy, that it\u2019s bringing out a deep sense of meaninglessness and divine absence. Right, right. And the zombies are a perfect representation of that because, unlike werewolves or vampires who interact with people, zombies don\u2019t do very much. I mean, they\u2019re wonderful symbols because you can project so much on them, but they\u2019re not great playmates. Yeah . Well, and part of the theological idea is that they are bodies are detached from souls in a way. Right. Not just that they\u2019re detached from life, they\u2019re just activated brain stems. But then you have \u2014 then you have\u2026 Wait, are you saying vampires have souls then? Yeah, well, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s another question we can get to . Vampires have emotional lives. At least the vampires you and I know from True Blood have emotional lives. Right \u2014 which zombies don\u2019t. No. Vampires have relationships, good or bad. Right. Zombies kind of push the boundaries of what is human because, as you say, they have bodies, but they have no emotions, they have no souls. So what is our response to them and our responsibility for them? It\u2019s a harder question. Right. So you think all these people are watching The Walking Deadbecause they\u2019re trying to figure out, you know, how do I react to a world where I feel like I\u2019m cut off from everything and I can\u2019t find meaning? Well, I\u2019m not sure that I know how to describe why people are watching it. But let\u2019s say, for example, when you and I spoke a couple of years ago, we talked about Lost. And there\u2019s a sense in which it\u2019s the same kind of \u2014 there\u2019s a similarity between, you know, setting this small group of survivors out on this, you know, constant adventure where they are confronted with horrors that have a certain supernatural bent to them and they\u2019re surviving. But The Walking Dead is much bleaker than Lost, right? I mean, Lost had all this pathos and beautiful moments and people finding love and redemption. The Walking Dead is a very dark view of life as a kind of \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a line. I was watching an episode of this woman who talks about this endless, horrific nightmare we live every day. Mm-hmm. And there is no miraculous or wonder or redemption. Did you see the episode where one of the main characters was talking about \u201Cwe need a miracle, we need a miracle\u201D and what happens is the boy gets shot? Yeah, so let\u2019s set this up. This was the second-season premier, which so many people watched, where they come across a Southern Baptist Church. And they walk inside and Rick, who\u2019s the kind of closest thing they have to a hero \u2014 well, first of all, they come inside and there are about three zombies sitting in pews looking at a huge crucifix, which is kind of interesting. You have no idea if they\u2019re thinking or what\u2019s going on. But then\u2026 No, they\u2019re saying to themselves, \u201CWhy is there a crucifix in a Southern Baptist Church?\u201D Right? What happended to the production design? I know that is a problem with the \u2014 I know. Well, what happened with the people who didn\u2019t really understand that it shouldn\u2019t be a Southern Baptist Church? But it\u2019s also a bigger crucifix than any crucifix I\u2019ve ever seen anywhere. So they have their battle with the zombies and then, interestingly, a few of them walk in and say prayers. Here\u2019s Rick \u2014 and this is the moment before that you\u2019re talking about. Wait. The zombies say the prayers or the people say the prayers? No, no. The people say. They get rid of the zombies, they have the zombie battle, and then a few of them walk in and say prayers that feel like this is the way life used to be, we used to walk into churches and say prayers, but here\u2019s Rick in the church. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re looking at me with what \u2014 sadness? Scorn? Pity? Love? Maybe it\u2019s just indifference. I guess you already know I\u2019m not much of a believer. I guess I just chose to put my faith elsewhere; my family, mostly, my friends, my job. The thing is we \u2014 I could use a little something to help keep us going. Some kind of acknowledgement, some indication I\u2019m doing the right thing. You don\u2019t know how hard that is to know. Well, maybe you do. Hey look, I don\u2019t need all the answers. Just a little nod, a sign. Any sign will do. Wait, Krista, that is amazing. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Well, it\u2019s sort of like, hey, Gethsemane. I mean, God, talk to me, right? So, you know, you think here\u2019s this like crazy show on AMC, but it is that central theological question of where is God in my suffering, right? Yeah, yeah, and it\u2019s absolutely explicit out there. Then, of course, he walks out of the church, he says give me a sign. This is a story we\u2019ve seen many times, right? And then they go out into the woods; he\u2019s with his little son and another man and they see a deer and it\u2019s a beautiful moment of nature and you think here\u2019s the sign and then it all goes terribly. A shot rings out. Not just the deer dies, but the child is hit as well. Right, which echoes back, taking my son. You know, whether it\u2019s Abraham and Isaac or whether it\u2019s God and Jesus. You want a sign? I\u2019ll take your son, right? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stretching to really read these deeper classic religious tropes onto the current scene because what is culture except making those tropes come alive in each generation. You know, people have been asking where is God for thousands of years and why wouldn\u2019t we be asking the same question and why wouldn\u2019t we want to represent it in our own language rather than in, you know, the King James version? What would Jesus have done? Seriously now. This is a scene from the new season of Showtime\u2019s Dexter. How do you reconcile your belief in a higher power \u2014 in a god \u2014 with what you\u2019ve done? What difference does it make? I\u2019m just curious. So, what \u2014 I\u2019m supposed to defend my beliefs to you? If you don\u2019t mind. Look \u2026 I mean \u2026 Everyone makes mistakes. They do things that they shouldn\u2019t do. And\u2026 they\u2019re only human. But God forgives us. Really? Really, is it as simple as that? You kill someone, and God forgives you for it? Yes! So I can kill you, and God will forgive me? I\u2019m Krista Tippett, with On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today: \u201CMonsters We Love.\u201D We\u2019re looking at the monsters \u2014 human and otherwise \u2014 who populate some spiritually and morally intriguing television right now. Zombies in particular are not only popular on the small screen. They\u2019re the subject of a best-selling literary novel; there are zombie \u201Ccrawls\u201D on Saturday nights in American cities; there have been people dressed up as \u201Ccorporate zombies\u201D at Occupy Wall Street. And then, there\u2019s something going on as well that\u2019s related, but not so directly theological, but about morality, right? You know, it\u2019s like what happens to morality when everything falls apart like this? And something that\u2019s difficult or troubling or especially challenging about zombies is you can show no mercy, right? You can chop their heads off without a minute of remorse. You know what I\u2019m saying? Like, and so Colson Whitehead, who\u2019s just written this new novel \u2014 zombie novel. Right. Right. I thought this was interesting he said, and this gets at this too. \u201CFor me, the terror of the zombie is that at any moment your friend, your family, your neighbor, your teacher, the guy at the bodega down the street, can be revealed as the monster they\u2019ve always been.\u201D So there\u2019s also some pretty earthy, dark reflection on humanity that\u2019s going on here. Right. That\u2019s why zombies who are like on The Walking Deadactually looking like zombies and zombies who seem to be real people provide an interesting counterpoint. So Breaking Bad, Walter White\u2026 Yeah. \u2026in some ways over the last three years, he\u2019s become more of a zombie. He\u2019s more and more cut off his human side and his human interactions \u2014 even as his cancer progresses \u2014 to stay alive and get one task done. And as he becomes more of a walking zombie, he\u2019s much more comfortable killing people and living in an amoral universe. So I have really had trouble getting into that one. I find it really hard to watch. So would you just give a little capsule of what the story there is, the plot and who he is? Breaking Bad is the story of a high school chemistry teacher who discovers he has terminal cancer and wants to make sure his family is taken care of when he dies. So he starts cooking up meth and selling it and he takes on one of his former students as his helper. And the show is about his descent into this criminal world of drug dealing and the implications that it has for his relationships and for his soul. And Vince Gilligan, the creator, has said that, to him, it\u2019s important to see that actions have consequences and to look at what happens to a person\u2019s soul once they make certain decisions. So the character does not remain static. The very fact of him getting deeper and deeper into a criminal life changes not only the dynamics of his family, like his wife leaves him, it also changes his whole personality. I mean, he becomes more cut off, more inward, and more amoral, more able to kill lest he be killed. You\u2019re not some hardened criminal Walt. You are in over your head. That\u2019s what we tell them. That\u2019s the truth. That\u2019s not the truth. Of course it is. A school teacher? Cancer? Desperate for money? OK, we\u2019re done here. Roped into working \u2014 unable to even quit! Let\u2019s both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit you\u2019re in danger. I am not in danger, Skyler \u2014 I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks! And it\u2019s a hard show to watch. I was thinking a lot about that, about the monsters I like watching as opposed to the monsters I don\u2019t like watching. I love watching True Blood and Vampire Diaries, but I don\u2019t like watching Dexter and Breaking Bad as much. I mean, it\u2019s easy to see why, right? Because, you know\u2026 The blood in one is real and, in another, it\u2019s not. Right, right. And monsters are sexy in those shows I like, whereas they\u2019re, you know, off-putting in others. But Breaking Bad is hard to watch. You know, it takes place in Albuquerque and the scenery is dry and the dialogue is sparse and the action is bleak. It is a hard show to watch, but it does have this almost biblical pace to it and the sense that it\u2019s dealing straightforwardly in issues of life and death. So here\u2019s something that I wonder about us as viewers. So this is, I mean, this is entertainment. And is there some difficult message about us as a culture or us as watchers that, on some level, we enjoy this? I don\u2019t know if enjoy is the right word. But you know what I\u2019m saying? What does the popularity of these things say about us? People want to see the basic dramas of their lives enacted. And why are passion plays so popular? Why the crucifix? Right. Those central themes speak to us in dramatic ways, and so we want to see them again and again. I mean, it\u2019s not easy watching the movie The Passion of Christ, which I suppose maybe that\u2019s sui generis and we shouldn\u2019t put it in there, but it\u2019s not easy watching a passion play and yet it\u2019s instructive and it\u2019s meaningful. You know, if you are Jewish, it\u2019s not easy going into synagogue and hearing the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, and yet you know you\u2019re hearing it for a reason or it\u2019s telling you something, or Job, for that matter. So, I think it performs a similar function. People have a hard time getting that because television is a consumer commodity, which is also entertainment. We don\u2019t think of religion and entertainment mixing. The truth is that religion and entertainment have always mixed, you know, whether it was the stained glass windows in European cathedrals or the passion plays put on or early movies that depicted the life of Christ. Religious people have used dramatic means to get a message across. And there is a lot of \u2014 I mean, you\u2019ve been writing about this. There\u2019s a lot of overt religion all over the place in a way that\u2019s kind of new, all kinds of religion. Yes. There\u2019s all kinds of religion, I have to say. Most of it\u2019s pretty Christian. You know, whether\u2026 Mm-hmm. True Blood is the one that really is diverse, right? It has Wiccans and\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. Alan Ball is usually pretty sensitive to marginalized groups and he\u2019s even said that, you know, the vampires can be stand-ins for gays or for any oppressed marginalized people. Has he said that? Yeah, yeah. Because that is actually \u2014 I mean, so there is religious diversity, you could say, but there\u2019s no so much theology in True Blood, but there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 well, there are these big existential and moral issues that get raised again about bigotry and otherness and, you know, immortality, mortality. I think they\u2019ve done some really interesting things with that in True Blood. Are you thinking of anything in particular? Sometimes it\u2019s just the mundane moments like when Bill Compton, who\u2019s a vampire \u2014 this feels like such a long time ago because the show has progressed so much \u2014 but when he proposes marriage to Sookie Stackhouse who\u2019s not a vampire and she opens up a ticket to Vermont. It turns out that that\u2019s where they legalized vampire-human marriage . I do have one last thing. Plane tickets? Where\u2019s Burlington? It\u2019s in Vermont. Vermont? Why would we\u2026 This is the other part. Ms. Stackhouse, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? That is assuming that last night didn\u2019t scare you off weddings for good. True Blood is a great example of a show, I think, that is about re-enchantment. So if you look at sort of the standard sociological critiques of society, what\u2019s happened in industrial post-capitalist society is that we\u2019ve lost the awe, we\u2019ve lost the beauty, we\u2019ve all been rationalized to the point where everything is \u2014 there\u2019s no transcendence anymore. So what we need is our culture to reawaken us to mystery and to awe and to wonder. So here\u2019s like this very prosaic Louisiana town, you know, with good old boys and, you know, rednecks and what do you know, but a vampire comes into the bar and, next thing you know, there\u2019s witches and werewolves and all kinds of others. Shapeshifters. Yeah. Shapeshifters. Yeah. I mean\u2026 Fairies. Right. And as the characters are being re-enchanted, hopefully the audience is also, right? Mm-hmm. I really like that. It\u2019s a much more upbeat sort of idea than those apocalyptic shows we were talking about before where there\u2019s mystery and wonder in the world, but it\u2019s like because everything is desolate . Yeah, if I could just ask you this straight question. I\u2019ve posed this question and I\u2019ve heard other people pose it in the last year. What is it with vampires? Why vampires? What do you think? There are reasons that are financial, there are reasons that are sexual, and there are reasons that are existential. Where shall we start? Hmm, I don\u2019t know. Sex, money or why am I here ? Give me a quick rundown of all three of them. Start with sex. Vampires are sexy and they are known throughout most of the literature to be great at seduction, to be powerfully erotic. There\u2019s something about that mixture of blood and death and eroticism that make us see them as heroic. Now obviously, all vampires weren\u2019t that way all the time. And again, this is partly because \u2014 and now we segue into finance. Commercially, it makes more sense to have a show around a sexy vampire than one that looks like Bela Lugosi. Beyond that, vampires speak to very basic issues of what does it mean to be a human being? And a lot of these shows basically are looking to see are vampires still human? Do they still care? Do they still have emotions? Do they have morality? You know, as stupid in some ways as Vampire Diaries is \u2014 and I have to say in all honesty I love Vampire Diaries\u2026 I haven\u2019t watched it. OK, so tell me. OK. Maybe \u2014 Vampire Diaries is a story of a small Virginia town. You know, it\u2019s sort of like True Blood. It\u2019s a small Virginia town that, even though it seems very straight and normal, it\u2019s just chock full of vampires and shapeshifters and witches, and they\u2019re all like breaking out in high school. The protagonist who is like a high school senior is torn between two vampire brothers. And the question is can she redeem their humanity? Can she get them to claim that part of themselves which they have let atrophy, and she believes is necessary if they are to be loving partners. So in a world where people do amoral things to each other, rather than think about doing shows on Bernie Madoff or folks like that, which you have done anyway, but how many can you do? Making your vampires who are sexy people emblematic of those moral struggles makes for good drama. So I think they\u2019re sexy, you know, they evoke questions of basic humanity, and there\u2019s also some things that are just striking about them. They live forever, you know, they have supernatural powers, they are monsters, but they\u2019re not monsters. What do you want to hear? That I cared about Rose? That I\u2019m upset? Well, I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m not. There you go. Pretending to turn it off. Pretending not to feel. Damon, you\u2019re so close, don\u2019t give up! I feel Elena. OK? And it sucks. What sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me. You feel guilty. I did some extra hardcore TV watching to get ready for this conversation with Diane Winston. In our unedited interview, we talked about all kinds of shows and other themes, like the retro cultural therapy of Mad Men and Pan Am \u2014 as well as the formative role Star Trek played in both of our early television lives; and what she calls the \u201CWomen Gone Wild\u201D witchiness of a character like Nurse Jackie.

Coming up, how God is making a serious TV appearance in surprising ways and places \u2014 like 24\u2018s successor, Homeland, and HBO\u2019s Enlightened. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. This program comes to you from APM, American Public Media. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, On Being: \u201CMonsters We Love \u2014 TV\u2019s Pop Culture Theodicy.\u201D I\u2019m catching up with Diane Winston, as I do from time to time. She watches media and religion at the University of Southern California. And we\u2019ve been talking about the wave of vampires, zombies, and soulless characters who happen to be human in the current crop of TV. But there\u2019s also a really telling shift of social commentary since she and I spoke a couple of years ago. For example, in the difference between 24 and the newest creation of some of 24\u2018s writers, Showtime\u2019s Homeland. Are you watching that? Homeland? Yes. I am addicted to that show. It\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s very good. It\u2019s one of those shows that was a little hard to watch at first because the characters were not tremendously attractive in either \u2014 to look at or in terms of their actions. Yeah. But the more I\u2019ve watched it, the more I\u2019ve appreciated Clair Danes\u2019 performance and also \u2014 what\u2019s the name of the male actor? Is that Damian Lewis? The Sergeant Brody character? Yes, Sergeant Brody. He\u2019s really good too. So the story there is that a \u2014 you know, I have to say when I was hearing reviews of it before it aired, I thought how can you carry a plot with that, right? That\u2019s there\u2019s an American soldier who was taken prisoner and has been released, and so he comes home a hero. Claire Danes is FBI, right? or Homeland Security? She\u2019s CIA, I think. CIA agent who, just before this Sergeant Brody was released, was whispered in her ear by a contact she has in some prison somewhere, Islamabad, someplace like that, that an American soldier has been turned. And so she suspects this guy who\u2019s now an American hero of being part of the enemy. But unlike Kiefer Sutherland, who was just full of certainty at every turn, right, the classic hero, she\u2019s manic depressive, she\u2019s very strong and interesting and stubborn, but she\u2019s in the dark and so are we about what\u2019s really going on. She\u2019s a little crazy, don\u2019t you think? She\u2019s crazy, yeah. So in terms of religion \u2014 and this is a very different way \u2014 direction for this to go. In terms of this overt religiosity, I mean, let\u2019s say in 24 Muslims were bad guys, but there was no real investigation of what it meant to be Muslim, right? It was an identity. Basically, Muslims were terrorists. This perplexing figure of Sergeant Brody \u2014 and we really still have no idea what\u2019s going on inside him. We know he\u2019s been tortured, we know that he\u2019s a human being who\u2019s struggling and there\u2019s a moment in the second or third episode, which comes out of the blue. where we know he made a trip to the store and he bought something and we don\u2019t know what he bought. And he goes into the garage and he pulls out a prayer rug and he washes his hands and he kneels and he prays. Did you see that? Yes, I did. It was almost like a Rorschach test about that character. What did you think when you saw him do it? Well, you know, I thought \u2014 Nancy Franklin did a review of this in The New Yorker, and she really put her finger on what I felt, which is \u201Cin that moment, we felt both more worried and less worried about him than we had before.\u201D But the human effect it had was here\u2019s this guy who\u2019s been tortured, he\u2019s clearly struggling to be back home with his family, to be back in the world. He felt more at peace than he had at any moment since you\u2019d been introduced to him. There was something quite beautiful and peaceful about it. That\u2019s so interesting, Krista, because when I saw it, I thought to myself, \u201COh, my gosh, Clair Danes is totally right. The guy is a Muslim sleeper-killer.\u201D And see, well \u2014 I thought it was such interesting complexity they introduced because so now we know \u2014 I think all we know is that, in those eight years of captivity or whatever, he converted to Islam or he began to pray as a Muslim. Now that you say it, I can see it. It\u2019s just that I think Americans at this time and place are predisposed to be so suspicious of Islam. Yeah, but I think it\u2019s actually dramatically challenging that, not by wrapping it up, but just kind of throwing out a challenge. Could this American hero have converted to Islam\u2026 Without betraying his country? Without betraying his country? And this is part of what\u2019s holding him together. Yeah. I think that show is great and it\u2019s interesting and I\u2019m going to watch it now with more appreciation because I guess that I am the kind of knee-jerk viewer who thought Islam was being used as a sign of disloyalty. So the fact of it being something which is holding him together and has constituted a new positive identity just never struck me. It would be great if you\u2019re right. The more I think about media, the more I come to believe that we live our lives through media and that people spend something like five to seven hours a day watching television. It\u2019s a place where we learn who we are and we learn who we are with and we figure out what\u2019s important to us. So on the one hand, it\u2019s easy to trivialize TV, but I really do believe we\u2019re looking at central concerns of many Americans today as they deal with economic crises, as they feel their life\u2019s out of control, as they feel like, you know, they\u2019re living in a world without hope. They are The Walking Dead, as you said. These shows, even as they on the one hand trivialize some of these issues by the very fact that they\u2019re commercial entertainment, they\u2019re still bringing them into the public square for discussion. So, yes, that was my little soapbox. Well, OK, and then you and I are talking about \u2014 well, the shows we\u2019ve talked about in this conversation are mostly quite aesthetically sophisticated storytelling and drama, cinema really. I mean, I guess I just have to ask. People who watch five to seven hours of television a day, I mean, some of that, including what my children watch, is reality TV, which is in a whole other category. Right. I mean, how does that fit into what you just said about the meaning-making function of this stuff? You know, I don\u2019t watch enough reality TV to say anything tremendously smart about that. I do think, to some extent, people watch reality TV, not Ace of Cakes or Home D\u00E9cor, but other kinds, in order to see models and to understand how people make decisions. I mean, whether they\u2019re watching the Kardashians or whether they\u2019re watching Real Housewives, it\u2019s entertaining. But I think it also offers them a big canvas on which they can project no, I don\u2019t want to be like the Kardashians or maybe I\u2019d like their house, but their values are screwy. Yeah, I wonder if reality TV in some ways is more escapist than, you know, these vampires we\u2019ve talked about where they\u2019re actually really big existential issues at play even though it\u2019s also high drama. Right. It also seems to me, oddly enough, more like wish fulfillment. Whether you\u2019re learning how to dress or bake cake or survive on a vacation, it\u2019s basically extending the material functions of your life one way or the other. I mean, it\u2019s not about, as you say, those existential questions. It\u2019s more about how do I take care of myself in the here and now or how do other people take care of themselves in the material level. Those of you who are watching Homeland will know that its religious plot thickened before this interview went to air. It\u2019s too simple just to say that I was right about Sergeant Brody. But here you go: What goes on in your garage? Why do you go there so late at night? So early in the morning? To pray. You\u2019re Muslim? Yeah. You live in despair for eight years, you might turn to religion too. And the King James Bible was not available. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being \u2014 conversation about meaning, religion, ethics, and ideas. Today, with media and religion expert and TV aficionado Diane Winston. And I would like to talk about Enlightened, which is this new half-hour weekly HBO show. It\u2019s HBO, right? With Laura Dern. Have you been watching that? Yes, and do you know the back story of this? No. OK, this is great. Laura Dern and Mike White created it. Mike White is the son of Mel White who was the conservative Christian minister who ghost-wrote books with Jerry Falwell and others and then came out and, you know, embraced his gay self. So Mike White grew up in this house and Mel White came out to the family years before he actually came out to everybody else. So he was living in this world where his father was a conservative minister in Pasadena, but also had this deep secret. Mike White has said that, at his home, his father often used Hollywood movies as a way to talk about spiritual issues. Now Mike White has done a number of movies with Jack Black and Laura Dern and other folks. In the middle of doing a TV show a couple of years ago, he had a nervous breakdown. And he has said that Enlightened sort of is a riff on what happened to him. It\u2019s not one-to-one correspondence, but his experience of kind of breaking down and then finding yoga and Buddhism helped to shape the material. So doesn\u2019t that make it like a whole different thing? It\u2019s really interesting. And, and the other thing that\u2019s so cool is, the industry where she works, Abaddon. Abaddon, in the Hebrew Bible, is the underworld and, in the Book of Revelation, Abaddon refers to the angel of the dark abyss. So the whole show is like going on, on a lot of different levels. But after reading about Mike White, I like the show better because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a parody up and up or whether it was trying to take on some of these issues. It seems to be skating on the edge of both. I think they really are asking, how do you live in this world without succumbing to desperation or unhappiness or greed? I mean, how do you find a way to live in this world where you aren\u2019t a cog in the system, yet you can still lead a somewhat normal life? Change will come. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But it will come. You have to believe. I close my eyes. And see a better world. People there are fearless and connected. They are my friends. I am there. I am free. And this earth itself is healed. And where nothing suffers. You know, you have written a lot and we talked about these overt religious themes that are there in really interesting ways even in something like The Walking Dead, I mean, the crucifix and the death of the son and all of it. But there\u2019s a way in which this show feels to me also like a maturing of how spirituality has come into the culture in the last 20 or 30 years. It\u2019s nodding to the fact that there\u2019s a flaky side to this , right, but it\u2019s also nodding to the fact that there\u2019s something that\u2019s really meaningful for people and somehow it\u2019s acknowledging that in a new way. I can\u2019t think of many shows that tackle this, can you? I mean, it feels new to me. Without just making fun of it. Right, without just making fun of it. It takes her real breakdown and putting herself back together seriously. And you do identify with who she wants to be. She wants to be an agent of change. Who doesn\u2019t want to be an agent of change? Yeah, exactly. So when we talked a couple of years ago, you were talking about where you were especially with your students about all the different ways people inhabit and work with the television that\u2019s meaningful for them. I mean, that\u2019s just exploded even in those years. I don\u2019t think Twitter was something anyone did back then. Part of why \u2014 and I\u2019m so glad you asked me this question because I should have said it. Part of why television has become even more powerful as a place for working out social and cultural issues is because we\u2019re no longer isolated intelligences watching in our own homes. So I am struck by the number of blogs that work on issues around Dexter or work on issues around zombies or work on issues around vampires, asking the questions that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last hour or so. What does it mean to be human? What is morality? How does justice figure into love? How do I know what\u2019s spiritual? Can people change? These very basic questions are debated by people now not only in forums or through blogs, but also Twittering on them. Whenever I Twitter on a TV show, you know, I get most responses to almost anything else I do, or posting on Tumblr or, you know, going through Buzz. I mean, there\u2019s so many ways to get these ideas out and so many people who want to talk about them. You know, people all over the world can debate whether or not, you know, the Muslim conversion in Homeland is a cynical ploy or a deep truth. So the fact of our mediated experiences further and deepen the spiritual connections that we are making through culture and through television in particular. And the fact that this goes on in our homes oftentimes or the fact that you can toggle between watching a TV show on your computer and Twittering at the same time, it just makes it even more immediate for people. Diane Winston is on Twitter @dianewinston; we are @Beingtweets. Find us there, or at facebook.com/onbeing or at onbeing.org, and tell us what shows you like that we just missed. Tell us about the TV that matters to you, what it says about who we are, what we fear, what we aspire to be.

She edited Small Screen, Big Picture: Television and Lived Religion. Her media and religion blog is called the SCOOP. And you can listen to this entire conversation again or our unedited interview at onbeing.org. We\u2019ll let Laura Dern take us out with another scene from HBO\u2019s Enlightened. So it was one morning, super early and I was meditating on the beach. You\u2019re giving me a smirky look. No, I didn\u2019t say anything. I want you to be open. I\u2019m wide open. Anyway, I decided to get in the water and a sea turtle just passed by, big, beautiful sea turtle. Wow. That\u2019s cool. I felt this presence all around me. It was God. Or it was better than God. It was \u2014 something was speaking to me. It was saying \u2014 this is all for you. And everything is a gift, even the horrible stuff. I know what you mean. I kind of had the same thing happen. I was at Red Rocks on some mescaline. . No, I\u2019m glad that happened to you. I am. To the presence of God, really. Presence of God. Trent Gilliss is senior editor. Kate Moos is executive producer.
