  "fullText": "The language of \u201Crepentance\u201D comes up unexpectedly in conversations I have about work we have to do in public, like racial healing. As a teacher to college students and a person in recovery, Louis Newman explores repentance as a refreshing practice, the stuff of our ordinary lives \u2014 even beyond the lifetimes of those we may have wronged. The Jewish High Holy Days, which are now upon us \u2014 the new year of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur \u2014 create an annual ritual of repentance, both individual and collective. The Hebrew word is teshuvah, and this is work that begins in oneself, but does not end there. We cannot literally go back in time and undo what we did. And yet, repentance is precisely that process by which we can \u2014 in the moral realm, if not in the physical realm \u2014 we can go back to the deed, we can find that part of ourselves that led to doing the transgression, and reform ourselves. I find that inspiring, to think that we are not in bondage to even our most grievous mistakes. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Louis Newman is Associate Dean of Carleton College in Minnesota and a professor of religious studies there. He is the author of several books on Jewish ethics and theology, including Repentance: The Meaning and Practice of Teshuvah. So I would like to start where I always start \u2014 how you would describe the spiritual background of your life, of your childhood? Well, I would say that I grew up here in St. Paul in a family that was very deeply Jewish. My parents were both leaders in the Jewish community in a variety of ways. I grew up in a home in which Jewish affairs and issues of Jewish life were just kind of dinner table conversation all the time. So that was kind of in the air. And then they felt that it was important for me to get a strong Jewish education, which my mother had, but my father hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d grown up in a small town in Brainerd, in Northern Minnesota. Right. And so they sent me to a Jewish afternoon school. And unlike most kids who sort of drop out after their bar or bat mitzvah age, I continued because I actually enjoyed it, and I liked studying, and I found the material interesting. And after I got to the end of high school, I decided I wanted to keep studying in college. So I took Hebrew\u2026 Right. \u2026more Hebrew in college and so on. And so it just sort of became a very important part of my educational life. But you\u2019re not a rabbi, are you? I\u2019m not a rabbi. So you\u2026 No. \u2026so your interest was in delving into the theology as an academic rather than a spiritual leader. That\u2019s right. And then I think as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019ve kind of come around through my own development to sort of explore the personal relevance of this material to me. And my academic life and my personal life are more and more intertwined the older I get, I guess. Yeah. I just want to mention one other thing. When you \u2014 in your writing, you talk about, in your childhood, that you were kind of a model child and that everyone told you that. And it seems to me that that came with a certain spiritual pressure, almost kind of \u2014 it was a complicated thing that created some distortions for you. And I just wondered if you would even \u2014 to me that also kind of belonged to that background through which you\u2019ve emerged. Absolutely. And it was only later on, I suppose, through some years of therapy, that I came to realize that I was proud of myself when I was a kid that my parents always thought I was \u2014 I could sort of do no wrong. Yeah. And then I began to realize, as I got older, that was really a double-edged sword. And that the other side of that was I could never admit to myself that I\u2019d done something wrong. I had to figure out some way to hide it, or run from it, or make it better immediately. And so I became more and more prone, I think, to wanting to claim only the best parts of myself. And that leads me, of course, into the subject of\u2026 It does. It leads right\u2026 \u2026repentance. I became aware that, you know, there\u2019s work to do here. Yeah. And there\u2019s a kind of a wholeness that\u2019s missing when you try to live your life always in that place of perfection or striving\u2026 Yeah. \u2026for perfection. Yeah. And so you wrote this book on repentance a few years ago and it\u2019s been sitting in my office all this time, and I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t explain the mysterious ways by which we finally get to something. But I think repentance is such a \u2014 both the idea and the notion so important \u2014 but one of the things you point out is that repentance is connected to the language and the notion of sin. And it\u2019s often used in conjunction with forgiveness, and often, as you say, kind of confused with forgiveness. And one of the things that you point out that feels important to me is you say in Christianity of course it\u2019s a very complicated notion in theology and sacred texts. But it\u2019s often connected in kind of a surface way with death and kind of with condemnation. So I wonder if you\u2019d just talk a little bit about kind of separating out repentance from sin and forgiveness, the way these things get talked about culturally. Sure. This is obviously a very rich topic and\u2026 It is. \u2026we could spend a long time on it. We could spend a long time on\u2026 I know. And I\u2019m\u2026 ..sin, altogether\u2026 So let\u2019s not \u2014 we can\u2019t stay here too long, but, let\u2019s start there. Of course. Because it feels important to me. Of course. Yeah. And this is a very loaded notion. Yeah. And it\u2019s actually not very \u2014 it doesn\u2019t ring very \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work very well in modern ears, I think. I think that\u2019s right. Mm-hmm. And that\u2019s why I begin by saying that while there are obviously many different strains within every religious tradition. Much of what Judaism teaches about sin is that it\u2019s a kind of \u2014 it\u2019s more like an illness than it is like death. And of course sometimes illnesses can be life-threatening, but many times they\u2019re not. And so you can be healed. There\u2019s a lot of talk about forgiveness and repentance as a form of healing. And it\u2019s a sense of there\u2019s something wrong that needs attention, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s necessarily my undoing. If only I bring my proper attention to it and turn away from the path that I\u2019m on toward a different path. Mm-hmm. A path of wholeness and integrity. And so in a certain way I think, it does seem to me that Christian writers very much more often talk about sin as a kind of \u2014 it\u2019s innate in our nature. Mm-hmm. And Jewish writers tend to talk about sin as though \u2014 though that notion is also present in Judaism \u2014 Yeah. They tend to talk about sin much more as missing the mark. It\u2019s a mistake. It could be a very serious mistake, but it\u2019s a mistake. And a mistake can be atoned for, and it can be undone. Yeah. I mean, here\u2019s something you wrote that \u2014 I really like this. \u201CSin is about pretending that something is true when in fact it is not. Idolatry is pretending that something is divine and worthy of our devotion when in fact it is not.\u201D And then you wrote \u201Crepentance is all about choosing truth over deception.\u201D Mm-hmm. I really like that. Oh, thank you. Yeah. No, I think repentance really is about coming to terms with who we really are. And that\u2019s true in a couple of a senses. It\u2019s true both in terms of claiming our own mistakes, not running from them, not hiding them, but actually claiming them. Knowing that they\u2019re true and owning them. And also owning the fact that deep down, our core essence is ultimately good. God created us with a pure soul, our tradition teaches. And in that sense, doing repentance, doing teshuvah, is about returning to the purity and wholeness that\u2019s kind of your original nature that you\u2019ve strayed from. And in that sense, too, it\u2019s about honesty and truthfulness. It\u2019s about being true to who we really are, ultimately. So, let\u2019s talk about the word, because language and words and letters in Hebrew are so important. Mm-hmm. And we can \u2014 they\u2019re barely \u2014 this isn\u2019t transparent to people reading the Bible who don\u2019t know Hebrew and it\u2019s very metaphorical and visual, and the exact translation of teshuvah would be turning, returning, responding. Talk about that word and the different metaphors that it suggests, and how those add up to a definition. Right. No, I think it is very important. And in Hebrew, there are sort of root words, and the root word of teshuvah \u2014 or \u201Cchu-VA,\u201D as people would typically say it\u2026 Yeah. \u2026in Anglicized form \u2014 is that it is about turning. So turning away from the path you\u2019ve been on, back toward a loftier goal, back toward our true selves, back toward God, back toward a righteous life. So it\u2019s a kind of shifting orientation, so really turning your attention somewhere else. It\u2019s also about returning. And in that sense, returning to one\u2019s true nature. As I said a minute ago, that sense of coming back to who we really most deeply are and were meant to be. And turning, of course, to God. And finally, it has that sense of responding. Teshuvah, in another sense, means a response, and an answer in modern Hebrew. And in that sense, it\u2019s really about as if there\u2019s a call coming out to us all the time, inviting us to repent. In fact, the tradition talks about this. There\u2019s a voice always coming from Mount Sinai inviting us to return. And that sense of responding to an ongoing call that\u2019s there, whether we\u2019re listening to it or not, is very much a part of what we mean by repentance. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the meaning of repentance in ordinary time and across the span of our lives, with Jewish ethicist Louis Newman. I remember when I studied the Hebrew Bible \u2014 and this was 20 years ago now \u2014 my professor talking about how visual the word is \u2014 and tell me if this is right, if I\u2019m remembering this right. Mm-hmm. That it was literally like \u2014 it had this image of literally stopping in your tracks and turning in another direction. That it was a very physical image. I think that\u2019s right. If you think about this in terms of a 360 degree circle, if you\u2019re headed in one direction and you turn only one degree or two degrees to the right or to the left, over a long period of time \u2014 it may be a very slight turn, but over an extended period of time, if you now walk in that direction, you\u2019ll end up in an utterly different place than if you extend that line outward infinitely. And that sense of turning even slightly\u2026 Yeah. \u2026it doesn\u2019t have to be a radical, all of a sudden transformation into a new life. It\u2019s actually a very gradual process of recognizing, \u201Cyou know, I need to pay attention to that particular failing a little bit more, and move in a little different direction.\u201D So, what\u2019s the connection again that is linguistic and metaphorical with the creative force of the universe? Was it that repentance was there before the creation? Right. Right? Somehow\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that repentance preceded the creation of the world. Right, right. Is that something Talmudic? It is Talmudic. Yeah. And it\u2019s actually one of the most startling and puzzling of the things that the rabbis say \u2014 the ancient rabbis say about repentance. Of all the things that the rabbis list that were created before the world, why is repentance one of them? Yeah. And many interpreters in later eras have explored that theme. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, who is most noted an Israeli scholar for his work on the Talmud, actually \u2014 but who\u2019s also a very, very profound philosopher \u2014 wrote a wonderful essay in which he explored this idea that when we do something wrong, what\u2019s done is done. We cannot literally go back in time and undo what we did. It\u2019s impossible, right? We only move forward, in one direction in time, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, we can\u2019t actually go back and undo the wrong we did, and yet, repentance is precisely that process by which we can, as it were, morally, in the moral realm \u2014 if not in the physical realm, we can undo what we did, because we can go back to the deed, we can examine ourselves, we can make amends for it, we can apologize for it, we can find that part of ourselves that led to doing the transgression, and search inside ourselves and reform ourselves. And to that extent, it\u2019s as if repentance allows us to breach the laws of causality in a funny way. It has to be created before the physical world because once you\u2019re in the physical world, the laws of causality and the laws of\u2026 Oh, I see. \u2026time marching forward are set. I find that inspiring to think that actually there\u2019s a way in which we are not chained to our past. We are not in bondage to even our most grievous mistakes. We can always find ways of repenting for them. There\u2019s something also, I think, that gets at a really core point in your thinking about this that, again, we\u2019re talking about repentance as different from talking about moral obligation or moral condemnation, or moral reckoning, in the way we sometimes talk about sin. But that it is in fact about gaining freedom, gaining moral freedom, as you said. In fact, to create beyond whatever was damaged or flawed or harmful. Right. It\u2019s really interesting. It\u2019s a really interesting idea, and one of the things that I came to realize is that in a certain sense when we don\u2019t own our transgressions, when we run from them, which is, after all, the most natural thing to do. \u201CI did something wrong, I cheated someone, I told a lie about something, I took credit for something I shouldn\u2019t have\u201D \u2014 whatever it was, however small or large, our immediate instinct, often, is to run away from it. Or to hide it. Or to lie about what we did wrong so that nobody will find out about it or something of that nature. Yeah. And in doing that, we essentially \u2014 we\u2019re in bondage to the thing that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re\u2026 Right. \u2026we have now essentially let it dictate our next move and the move after that. To do repentance is to be free of that. And ironically, or maybe paradoxically really, it\u2019s when we own \u2014 it\u2019s when we run toward our transgressions, rather than away from them, that we actually become free of them. That we actually then can\u2026 Right. \u2026by owning them and then claiming them and then distancing ourselves from what we have really taken full credit for \u2014 only then are we really free of it. And you are in recovery. I am. I joined a recovery group 14 years ago, and I\u2019ve been going regularly ever since. And it\u2019s a profound experience in a lot of ways, partly because it\u2019s in the context of a very safe space of other people, who are coming to terms with their own failings and their own addictions of various kinds\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that you actually have the freedom to say, \u201CI did this. I drank to excess. I did these other things and lied about them. I did all of these things that I\u2019m ashamed of.\u201D And say that out loud, and know that the circle in which you\u2019re sitting is a circle of people who will accept you and support you in your desire to own those things, and repent for them, and become a different kind of person. Mm-hmm. And in that sense, I think the process of repentance as Judaism describes it is really quite close. The steps might have been in a slightly different order had\u2026 Right. \u2026a Jewish person written them, but\u2026 Yeah. \u2026but that\u2019s a sort of a technicality, really. In fact, the 12-step program really is a program of repentance. It\u2019s a program of spiritual development and moral accountability. And you used the language of soul-reckoning as part of your understanding of repentance. So I\u2019d like you to talk about that, but also just how, as you said, the 12 steps might have been in a different order and they might have been phrased somewhat differently if they were written by a rabbi. Mm-hmm. But I\u2019m also curious about how the language and the intelligence in the 12 steps has kind of flowed into your theology, your understanding \u2014 how that has nuanced and deepened, perhaps, your understanding of the nature of repentance and the kind of stages of repentance. That\u2019s interesting. The first step that someone gives in a 12-step group is often a step in which you recount the story of your own addiction and some of the things that you did \u2014 whether that\u2019s drug abuse, or other kinds of addictive behaviors. And the ways in which it dragged you down and distorted your relationships, and distorted your sense of self, and filled you with a sense of guilt and shame. One of the people in my group consistently, time after time, would talk about how much he appreciated hearing this person\u2019s story, because he could see the goodness in this person. And I was really sort of taken aback the first time I heard him do this. It was like, are you kidding? I just heard this person talking about being deceitful and stealing to support his habit, and whatever else he did. Right. And yet I realized after hearing him do that a few times that what he heard was the remorse, and the remorse really is the sign of the goodness showing through. It\u2019s that point at which we both really acknowledge and claim and own what we did, and also step back from it and look at it from a bit of a distance and can say, I really don\u2019t want to live that life. And that\u2019s a sign of goodness. That\u2019s a sign of the goodness reasserting itself over against your having fallen into a dysfunctional pattern of behavior. And that\u2019s very much like what Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a famous Hasidic teacher, means when he says that we should always look for the good in others. And that in fact, even in a person who\u2019s virtually completely sinful, he says you should find the very smallest bit of goodness in them. And on that account, you should judge them for their merits. And when you do that, he says \u2014 even for the person who\u2019s most sinful \u2014 when you see their goodness, you help them repent. That\u2019s such a different impulse than we have culturally. I think you say somewhere that we bounce back and forth between a pervasive failure to hold people accountable and an equally powerful obsession with doing so. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. I think that our culture has actually sort of \u2014 got this all wrong, mostly. In the sense that there\u2019s this funny way in which I think repentance is exactly in the middle. It insists that you be held fully accountable and it insists simultaneously that there\u2019s a way back. You can listen again and share this conversation with Louis Newman through our website, onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today we\u2019re exploring the refreshing practice of repentance. That\u2019s a word often used in conjunction with sin or forgiveness, but it\u2019s quite a distinct spiritual and practical move. Individual and collective repentance, or teshuvah, is at the heart of the Jewish High Holy Days of Yom Kippur. I\u2019m speaking with Louis Newman, who has worked as a Jewish ethicist at Carleton College, and as a person in recovery, on what repentance means in ordinary lives in ordinary time. You talk about it as a lost art. And I think the complexity of it is suggested by what you just said. Because we have a couple of different impulses, and they land on either side of that. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. So, Judaism does this incredible thing, right? The ancient Israelites set aside this day on the calendar. Right. Of expiation, of the sins of the people. I\u2019ve been \u2014 I can be envious at times of these \u2014 of this kind of ritual, which to me, also \u2014 Yom Kippur \u2014 like the word repentance, it has this bodily component. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s not merely spiritual. Which really reflects an intelligence about the fullness of humanity, which \u2014 it\u2019s remarkable that that was in the origins of this ritual 20 centuries ago. Right. And from my perspective, I think it\u2019s an acknowledgement that \u2014 I mean, in modern terms we might say hitting the reset button. Yeah. There\u2019s a way in which every year we ought to have an opportunity to examine the past, to own what we did, to repent for it, and to start fresh. And of course, it\u2019s closely associated with the holiday of Rosh Hashanah. It comes ten days later. It\u2019s the beginning of the new year. Now, in ancient times there was a whole ritual, and a goat was slaughtered, and all the rest of the ritual that involved putting the sins of the people onto a scapegoat and sending it off into the wilderness. And a lot of very, very powerful physical rituals that we, of course, no longer observe. But all of that has been turned into a process of public confession, and a process of personal introspection so that those days are really designed to clean us out and that\u2019s\u2026 Right, that language\u2026 \u2026that\u2019s very much part of the tradition\u2026 \u2026of cleansing. \u2026of why you wear white on Yom Kippur. Because you want to outwardly try to manifest a sort of sense of purity and freshness and new beginning that you\u2019re striving for internally and spiritually. I\u2019m also \u2014I think it\u2019s important that \u2014 so there\u2019s also the day after Yom Kippur. Yes. Of course. And, you know, I think that the ritual of being washed clean is one thing. And then there\u2019s the living it. You wrote something for The Jewish Forward, which is a really interesting magazine. Mm. So what you\u2019re describing is \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s work, right? It\u2019s work that is the work of a lifetime. Mm. Indeed. But in Judaism, also, there\u2019s this promise that the rewards of repentance are commensurate with the difficulty. And I thought that was so interesting in this article in the Forward. They titled it \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this is the title you gave it \u2014 \u201CThe Thrill of Repentance.\u201D Kind of pointing at what you gain. Right. What you gain\u2026 Right. \u2026by this way of living. Right. And it\u2019s true. I think for anyone \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have to be through a 12-step program or any formal program at all, actually \u2014 but anyone who\u2019s had that experience of really coming to terms with something that they did wrong, actually apologizing and expressing their remorse to the person that they hurt, and feeling free then of it \u2014 that process, which we\u2019ve all experienced at one time or another, is thrilling. It\u2019s cleansing. And it feels as though \u2014 sure, it\u2019s hard. Nobody wants to step forward to the person that they\u2019ve harmed and say, \u201CI was really callous and mean and shortsighted when I said or did the thing that I did before.\u201D But when you do it, you find that there\u2019s a liberation in it. Yeah. It\u2019s the joy that comes from feeling as though you\u2019ve overcome the past instead of being enslaved to it. You mention briefly in your writing that you once conducted some ethnographic studies of the ethics of professionals. I did, through a project I did\u2026 And I wonder how does that\u2026 \u2026at University. What did you learn? How did that illuminate this reflection you\u2019ve done on repentance and how humanly possible it is, and how it might work in different parts of our lives? Right. It\u2019s fascinating. It was a very interesting project through the Poynter Center at Indiana University. I was \u2014 this was now quite a number of years ago. I was actually involved in two different phases of that project. And two articles came out of that. One involved looking at the ethics of \u2014 it was all about looking at the ethics of professionals\u2026 Yeah. \u2026of different kinds. And each person in the group chose a different group of professionals to work with. And once I did this with pediatricians and pediatric specialists. And once I did it with trial court judges. And in both cases, interestingly, I discovered one thing that was quite similar. There is, in the context of professional practice for physicians, the opportunity to acknowledge \u2014 again among themselves and in safe spaces \u2014 I really made a serious medical mistake here. Right. And some patient got worse, or maybe even died as a result. And I need to recognize that and own that, because in order to avoid making that same mistake again, I need to know what I did wrong. And I need to have a safe place in which to do that. And to talk about that. And the trial court judges that I talked to talked about how the power that they wield over the people who appear before them in court is sort of awesome, and that they need to be aware of their own vulnerabilities, prejudices, failings. They need to know their own blind spots to know that \u2014 as one judge put it to me, a very attractive young woman comes before him and he might give her a more lenient sentence than somebody who looks kind of mean and bedraggled, and somebody that he wouldn\u2019t want to associate with. And to know that is to know that you have that vulnerability and to work against it. To be blind to that is precisely to avoid the kind of level of ethics that we expect of professionals and that they expect of themselves. And so that, to me, tied in very closely with this notion of soul-reckoning. That we have to actually know ourselves deeply, that each transgression is an opportunity to go now why did I do that? Why did I speak ill of that person behind their back? Or why did I snap at my spouse? Or scream at my kids, or whatever I might have done on a given day. What was it going on for me that made me do something that I\u2019m now regretting? And to know that about myself is to know where the growing edge of my moral life is. And to be able to then move beyond the behavior of the past. And so, what I learned in talking to these professionals, really, is that they are \u2014 whether they call it repentance or not, they are engaged regularly in their own process\u2026 Right. \u2026of coming to terms with what their own vulnerabilities are. And recognizing that if they don\u2019t do that, they risk some very serious mistakes. Yeah, so clearly, again, this is work. But it\u2019s the work of being alive, being fully alive, maybe. Here\u2019s something you wrote that I want to read. It\u2019s a little bit long, but I think it\u2019s really lovely. You say, \u201Cthe costs of ignoring the work of repentance\u201D \u2014 which I think we do in our public life \u2014 \u201Care not easily quantifiable, but the evidence is all around us. We see it in the lives of public figures, politicians, and corporate executives who get caught in some deceitful or fraudulent behavior, and deny it. We see it on daytime television shows where people confess their transgressions before a live audience for their entertainment. Most of all we know it in those quiet moments in our own lives when we recognize that we are not living up to our own moral standards, yet don\u2019t know how to restore our own sense of wholeness and integrity.\u201D And then you say \u201Cthe ultimate benefit of doing teshuvah is that it offers us a way to overcome our past precisely because we have confronted and taken full responsibility for it. It enables us to escape the sense of guilt, in some cases even despair with which many of us live. In its place, we come to live with self-acceptance and hope, because we know that moral renewal is always a possibility.\u201D Right. That\u2019s very beautiful. Thank you. It\u2019s striking, as I did this exploration of repentance I was always struck every time I would read something in the paper or watch something on the evening news, but you know, the person\u2026 There it is. \u2026standing in front of the courthouse\u2026 Yeah. \u2026and \u201CI didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201D This sort of, almost charade that gets played. Because we have this notion that if we put up a good enough front, the world doesn\u2019t have to know what we really did wrong. Yeah. And we\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t know. We\u2019d rather let that remain a secret. And so that\u2019s part of, I think, what makes the work of repentance so incredibly arduous \u2014 is you have to be willing to live transparently. At least in the context of a small, say, recovery group, or in the context of your most intimate relationships. You have to let people know you fully and to do that is to make yourself extraordinarily vulnerable. So you pose a few hard questions, I think \u2014 puzzles, really \u2014 that have been much considered, but still remain hard, open questions. And one of them \u2014 I\u2019d love to know how you think this through \u2014 is, are there transgressions for which repentance is impossible? And if so, why? Right. Well, of course, this question invariably comes up when I speak about this\u2026 Yeah. \u2026in synagogues and other places where I\u2019ve been invited to talk. And immediately, for many modern Jews, it\u2019s the Holocaust\u2026 It\u2019s the Holocaust. \u2026that\u2019s the first thing\u2026 Right. \u2026that comes to mind. How can you \u2014 Right. How can a Nazi repent for the extraordinarily\u2026 Yeah, how could that mean anything? Right, exactly. And would we even consider such a thing. Mm-hmm. So, within the tradition you find a couple of different points of view about this. Of course, you find this extraordinary passage in Exodus in the context of talking about Pharaoh, and God hardening Pharaoh\u2019s heart. And what does all that mean? And at some points the rabbis talk about the notion that the person who says, \u201CI\u2019ll sin and repent, I\u2019ll sin and repent\u201D \u2014 as if to say, \u201CEh, this is no big deal. I\u2019ll sin and I can just go on. Yom Kippur comes around all of us\u2026\u201D Right. \u2026\u201CI can get a\u2026 Right. \u2026free ticket.\u201D Right. It\u2019s like a get out of jail free card. That person, they say \u2014 it\u2019s not possible for that person to repent. And they may mean by that that it\u2019s psychologically impossible for that person to ever really acknowledge, deeply acknowledge and do the work of repentance. They haven\u2019t taken themselves seriously enough yet to actually do this work. And it may be the case that there are people who have sort of become so habituated to sinful behavior and egregious behavior that they really can\u2019t find their way back. I think we\u2019ve all known people who\u2019ve integrated harmful behavior towards themselves or others into their sense of self, even into their sense of power. Right? Right. And we\u2019ve all done that at some point. But you \u2014 I certainly think I\u2019ve known people who you feel like they\u2019ve gone past the point of no return. I do think that that\u2019s a possibility. And at the same time, I want to add, the tradition also wants to say that even though \u2014 well, to take the common example \u2014 You\u2019ve got to apologize and make restitution to the people you\u2019ve harmed in order to do full repentance. Suppose that person can\u2019t be found? It was somebody that you stumbled across in some situation and you don\u2019t even know their name. You couldn\u2019t even find them if you wanted to. Or suppose it\u2019s a person who has now passed away, and you literally can\u2019t\u2026 I mean, or\u2026 \u2026apologize to them. Or let\u2019s name that hardest of examples. I mean, what if it\u2019s a Nazi who can\u2019t speak to the six million Jews who died? Or the\u2026 Right. \u2026other millions of people who died. Right. Exactly. And interestingly there are these fascinating passages \u2014 one from Maimonides in which he\u2019s sort of giving us this whole catalogue of sins for which you can\u2019t achieve full repentance. Supposedly. Because of one of these things there\u2019s a barrier of one sort or another to doing one of the steps of repentance that\u2019s required. And at the very end of the list, paradoxically, he says all of these are impediments to repentance, but if you truly want to repent, the gates of repentance are always open and you can. Right. So, he sort of wants to have it both ways in a funny sense. Yeah. And I think the tradition wants to walk a fine line because on the one hand, it wants to acknowledge the depths of evil to which humanity is capable of falling. And it wants to say but hope is always there if you genuinely want it. So let\u2019s take the example of the Nazi or of the mass murderer. Yeah. You know, obviously the killings recently in Charleston come to mind. Yeah. It\u2019s just a small example. Yeah. But nonetheless, an extraordinary\u2026 That young man. Right, the young man who walked into the church and killed all those innocent people. And you want to say what could a person possibly do? Well, so imagine for a moment if that person were willing to move into the African American community and devote the rest of his life \u2014 and he might have a very long life ahead of him \u2014 to working on behalf of the issues that mattered to African Americans. And supporting the church whose lives he destroyed that day, that Sunday. And if he were genuinely remorseful and spent the rest of his life devoted to undoing the wrong he did as best he could, would we not want to say, well he can\u2019t undo the past \u2014 but remember the point is not undoing the past. The point is growing from the past and turning yourself around and demonstrating that you\u2019re genuinely a new person. Mm-hmm. And I think we could acknowledge that that is a possibility. Well, and in the case of Charleston, there\u2019s also this remarkable witness in front of us of the family members of the people who he killed who, that day, decreed \u2014 declared that he was still worthy of love. Right. They actually created an opening. That\u2019s right. And that message is \u2014 many Jews again think of that all-forgiving God as a kind of a Christian notion and\u2026 Yeah. \u2026the God of the Hebrew Bible is the God that wants to hold us accountable. Yeah. But the truth is God both wants to hold us accountable and wants to forgive us. Yeah. And that\u2019s one more of the paradoxes of this work of repentance. If you\u2019re not fully accountable, then you don\u2019t have to do repentance. If you have no way back, then there\u2019s no point to doing repentance. It\u2019s exactly at the point at which you both are fully accountable and fully free to choose a different path that repentance sits. And that\u2019s the balancing act. You have to believe both that you are accountable and that you\u2019re free in order to repent. I\u2019m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today exploring the refreshing practice of repentance \u2014 work that begins in oneself but does not end there. Louis Newman has explored this as a Jewish ethicist and as a person in recovery. So this also comes close to another very mysterious notion that\u2019s in your writing about repentance \u2014 that there is a notion of repenting to the dead. Mm. Would you talk about that? Well, again, the rabbis have this extraordinary idea that if you need to repent to a person who\u2019s died, you\u2019re supposed to go to the grave of that person, and bring with you ten members of the community. And ten members is significant because that\u2019s the minimum quorum for communal prayer\u2026 Yeah. \u2026in Jewish tradition. And in the hearing and the witness of those ten people, you apologize to the deceased. And thereby you do repentance. You do teshuvah. And it\u2019s interesting. What I wrote in the book \u2014 I\u2019ve never known anybody who\u2019s actually done this \u2014 and it sounds remarkable. Yeah. And then one day, in the context of talking to somebody in a synagogue in Palo Alto, they told me the story of somebody who did exactly that \u2014 of a woman who had a younger sibling who had been disabled, and then died. And this older sibling felt that she had always been mean and not properly respectful of the needs of her younger sibling. And she felt terribly guilty after her sister died. And she went to the grave with her parents and repented to her now-deceased sibling. And you can imagine the power that that would have. Yeah. To actually know that there\u2019s even then a possibility of trying to make right what you did wrong. And I think as you described that you talk about the implications of it. What it implies is that when we harm another person, or when we fail to rise to the occasion, that we somehow damage the community as a whole. That the consequences of our action kind of transcends space and time. I mean, just as our bodies and our psyches hold a lot that transcends space and time. Yeah. You don\u2019t have to talk about it in a mystical way. Our sins live on after us, right? Yeah. There\u2019s some sense in which what we did wrong continues to have impact and ripple effects long after we\u2019re not even here to see them any longer. Yeah, you said that \u201CJews have long-believed that our transgressions against one another have cosmic consequences.\u201D But then there\u2019s also the flip side of that, which is Martin Buber saying, \u201CThe wounds of the order of being can be healed in infinitely many other places than those at which they were inflicted.\u201D Which is such a wonderful thing to think about. When I came across that passage in Buber\u2019s writing, I was struck by the power of that notion. Yeah. That \u2014 so I can\u2019t go back and find the person that I actually harmed, but suppose I could find some other person in like situation and make it up to them. If I can now be more loving and compassionate toward others in ways that I wasn\u2019t on a given occasion with someone else, I can rebalance the scales of justice, so to speak, in the universe by bringing more love and compassion into the world in one place where I took it away in some other. And that is a very Jewish notion also, that one \u2014 even one good deed starts to tilt the scales. Starts to tilt the scales, starts to tilt those larger scales. That\u2019s right. And they talk in the Talmud about \u2014 power of repentance is that it brings redemption to the world. Right. That each good deed we do, each time we repent, we actually push the world a little closer toward goodness. And a little farther from evil. And in that sense, every act has cosmic significance. It\u2019s like the Arc of the Moral Universe is long but it bends towards justice. Right. There\u2019s a sense in which it\u2019s a very long arc, but every little bit that every one of us does moves it a little farther in the right direction \u2014 bringing the world closer to the place that God wants it to be. Mm-hmm. And you know, you acknowledge that miracles are out of fashion\u2026 Yeah. \u2026but this is what we\u2019re talking about here. There\u2019s mystery to it. There\u2019s an alchemy to it. So as you quote Rabbi Soloveitchik \u2014 Rabbi Soloveitchik said, \u201CRepentance cannot be comprehended rationally. It does not really make sense. Even the angels do not understand what repentance is.\u201D Right. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to think \u2014 even if you don\u2019t believe in angels, the notion that angels wouldn\u2019t even understand \u2014 even angels wouldn\u2019t understand this. Yeah. I end the book there because it strikes me that there is something mysterious in the human spirit. That gets touched in this process of repentance. That is to say, I\u2019ve watched this happen in the lives of other addicts, and recovering people in the circle that I\u2019ve been a part of for these years. And I\u2019ve seen it outside of that circle in others\u2026 Yeah. \u2026that a person who may have been habitually one way, at a certain point really does turn their lives around and become a different kind of person. How did that happen? How did they manage to do that? What was it that enabled them to make the changes all of a sudden, or maybe even gradually, at one point in their lives, that they were incapable of making at an earlier point in their lives? It is a kind of a mystery and the notion that I can take my faults and turn them into merits is \u2014 makes no sense rationally. Yeah. As I say, it\u2019s like having an accountant tell you that a debit is a credit or something. It doesn\u2019t compute. And yet, in another sense, on a spiritual level, it\u2019s entirely possible that we could take our failings and use them to move our lives forward toward more wholeness and toward more goodness. And when we see that happening, it\u2019s sort of wondrous and mysterious. And then, because I like just continuing to assert the paradox \u2014 then there\u2019s the mystery of that, of the turn and the return, but there\u2019s something in me that takes delight in this paradox: that redemption then is real, but it also doesn\u2019t mean perfection or moral blamelessness. So there\u2019s an end which is also a beginning. And that life goes on in all its fullness and messiness, though it may be changed. That\u2019s right. Because the purpose of this is sort of a burning away of the dross of the human spirit, right? And it\u2019s never done, and yet each time you do it, you know that you have come a little closer to the kind of life that you were meant to live. One of the other hard questions that you pose is \u2014 it\u2019s not as hard as is there no transgression which cannot be \u2014 for which repentance is impossible, but here\u2019s the question: \u201CWhat is the experience of teshuvah for those who engage in repentance continually throughout their lives?\u201D So, I do want to turn that question at you \u2014 and this is something that you\u2019ve been not just practicing in your life as a Jew, but also reflecting on as a scholar in your spiritual life, and as a person in recovery. And as a person who has this ritual of Yom Kippur year in, year out. So I just wonder, as you\u2019ve moved through your life with all of that, what have you learned that continues to nuance it, and also what have you learned about how to make it more real and more effective? Hm. That\u2019s a wonderful question. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s never easy. I mean, the path is laid out. The tradition is very clear about how one goes about doing this work. And even if one practices it regularly, it\u2019s still hard. It\u2019s still hard to live in that self-reflective way of knowing always that there\u2019s an opportunity here to grow, and to learn, and to do better. And so I\u2019ve learned that without the support of a network of people around me in my recovery circle, it would be very difficult to do this. Mm-hmm. It\u2019d be very difficult without that support and simultaneously, without the support of my own religious community, the synagogue that I attend regularly and am very active in. The larger circle of friends with whom I share deeply the things that are happening in my life. I want to underline that, because I think that we\u2019ve talked about how hard it is to talk about something like repentance in American culture, and I think something that works against it is that we tend to think of everything being an individual effort. And so one of the things you\u2019re saying is that you sink more deeply into this sacred realization that we aren\u2019t supposed to be alone with this stuff. Anyway, keep going. That\u2019s absolutely right. Yeah. I think it is \u2014 the work is our own as I said earlier. But the process, the context, is\u2026 Yeah. \u2026is a communal one. And, I guess the other thing I\u2019ve learned is that \u2014 \u201Cthe thrill of repentance,\u201D to use that expression\u2026 Yeah. \u2026the sense of joy, or you might say in sort of 12-step terminology, in the terminology of the serenity prayer, the sense of serenity that one finds \u2014 that I have found when I have felt that I\u2019ve actually done something wrong and then really, truly repented for it. That sense of serenity and calm and peacefulness is among the most wonderful feelings I know. And that\u2019s part of what maybe propels me to keep wanting to do it. Yeah. Right. Despite how arduous and hard it is, right? Right. Because there really is a payoff. Mm-hmm. The payoff really is that I feel cleaner morally. And that\u2019s what makes this work worthwhile. Is that it enables us to repair what\u2019s broken. One of the great things that, again, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov said was \u201Cif you believe you have the power to ruin it, believe you have the power to fix it.\u201D And I think there\u2019s a proportionality here that the work is really hard, but the benefit is really remarkable. And I think those are the two things I\u2019ve learned from both my personal work and my scholarly work. And even the work that I\u2019ve done in the context of my own Jewish community where in various leadership roles I\u2019ve had opportunities to work with a lot of people and watch all sorts of relationships go bad, and then work with people to help try to make up for what got off track. And doing that and watching that happen, there is a kind of miraculous quality to it. Yeah. And you feel like you\u2019re witnessing something really extraordinary when that happens.
