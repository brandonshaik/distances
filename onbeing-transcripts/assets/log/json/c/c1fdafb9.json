  "fullText": "B\u00E9la Fleck is one of the greatest living banjo players in the world. He\u2019s followed what many experience as this quintessential American roots instrument back to its roots in Africa, and he\u2019s taken it where no banjo has gone before. Abigail Washburn is a celebrated banjo player and singer, both in English and Chinese. These two are partners in music and in life \u2014 recovering something ancient and deeply American all at once; bringing both beauty and meaning to what they play and how they live. When I heard Doc Watson, I felt like I heard the beauty of authentic American culture. And I wanted it so badly. I\u2019d been looking for it so badly. And I finally heard it when I heard Doc \u2014 this high, lonesome, searching, struggling, suffering, hopeful voice singing this ancient melody and these old, old words. For me, what I think \u2014 the word I thought of when you were talking about that, what you actually heard was the truth. It just sounds so true, even though it\u2019s just notes. There\u2019s something more about it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. When Abigail Washburn graduated from college in 1999, she was poised to work for world peace after studying law in Beijing, but she was captured by the banjo instead. B\u00E9la Fleck became well known with his group B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones. I spoke with them in 2015 when Nashville Public Radio brought us together at the Belcourt Theater in their hometown. So, Abigail, I know that you have a habit of bursting out into song spontaneously, and I want to encourage you to do that tonight. You can dance, anything that \u2014 or if you want to grab your banjo. OK. Where I always start my conversation, whether I\u2019m talking to a physicist or a banjo player, is I\u2019d like to hear a little bit about whether there was a religious or spiritual background to your childhood. And Abigail, I\u2019d like to start with you. All right. You grew up in a few places: Chicago, Washington, Minnesota a little bit. I forgot that you were going to study me. That I\u2019ve become an expert on \u2014 I know. Yes. Oh, my. Yeah, well, my grandmother, who was in Evanston, Illinois most of her life, raised my mother there a Unitarian Universalist. And I was raised from 3 to 11 years old in Montgomery Village, Maryland. And the religious education in that UU Church \u2014 we actually went to everybody else\u2019s church. We learned about what it was like to go to Temple or Synagogue or Mosque, all kinds of different churches. And I was the kid in high school that instead of having band posters on my wall, I had Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi and the United Nations mural. And instead of going to my senior prom, I decided to go to the United Nations Youth Disarmament Conference in Canada. And I ended up coming back in time for prom because a cute guy asked me. But I actually did think that was more important to go the U.N. Youth Disarmament Conference. Wow. But, so that was my childhood as much as I should probably say. And by the time I was leaving high school and going off for all the different adventures, the next chapter, I would say that I believed that my faith and my spiritual path was about cultivating myself for good action. Hmm. B\u00E9la, how do you think about the \u2014 how would you think about the religious or spiritual background of your childhood, however you think about that now? You grew up in New York. Yeah. I was raised a harmless heathen. Mm-hmm. And so \u2014 my mother\u2019s family is Jewish. My father\u2019s family wasn\u2019t. But they were split up when I was a kid. And actually, I didn\u2019t meet him until I was in my 40s when I searched him out, which is another story. And well, I know I didn\u2019t feel like I had any kind of religious or spiritual thing going on as I grew up. And I think I was looking for something when the banjo turned up and sort of took the place of a lot of that for me. It sort of became my most important thing. And a lot of the things in religion you can find in music too. So I\u2019m hoping that that\u2019s going to work out for me. I think it\u2019s done fine. If there\u2019s a hereafter. Just as long as you have your banjo with you. I sense that your mother must have communed musically, if not spiritually, with music also. She \u2014 this is so fascinating \u2014 she named you after not one, but three Central European composers. Yeah, actually, that was my father, who I didn\u2019t know. And believe me, I got the better names than my older brother. I won\u2019t go into that right now. Really? What are your three names? B\u00E9la\u2026 B\u00E9la Anton Leo\u0161 Fleck. Really? Yeah. And so, after Bartok, Jan\u00E1\u010Dek\u2026 Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek. And who\u2019s the third? Anton Webern. So, some pretty out there stuff. But not banjo music. I mean, out there in a different way. Well, it could be. Well, it could be. Well, you\u2019ve done \u2014 yeah, you\u2019ve done that. And you discovered the banjo \u2014 you were captivated by Earl Scruggs. Yeah. Earl Scruggs of \u201CThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201D theme, which actually \u2014 people talk about a \u201Ccome to God\u201D moment, and for most banjo players of note in the bluegrass world, hearing Earl Scruggs is that moment. And there\u2019s before and after. So tell us about that. What is that? What is it that happens in that moment? I remember it was like lights going off. Every note was like a light going off in my brain. It was just an amazing sound. And now I try to explain it as being a high-tech yet primitive sound. Like, a computer can play fast, but you don\u2019t get excited, you know? But there\u2019s something so earthy and deep, especially about the way Earl Scruggs played, which turned people into believers. Mm-hmm. You said something about real \u2014 I mean, you said this before that people talk about the banjo as though it\u2019s not a real instrument, which then I guess gets at the question of how we define \u201Creal,\u201D right? Well, first of all, I think it\u2019s fascinating that neither one of you \u2014 you\u2019re both, actually came from the North. Neither one of you grew up surrounded by banjo and bluegrass. So talk about that, about the reality. I mean, what is real? What is real? About this music that captured you, that just takes you away? Well, my \u201Ccome to God\u201D moment in the folk music world was hearing an LP of Doc Watson singing and playing \u201CShady Grove.\u201D Is this where you want me to bust into song? Yeah, I do. I was hoping you\u2019d ask. \u201CShady Grove, my little love / Shady Grove, my darling / Shady Grove, my little love / I\u2019m going back to Harlan.\u201D When I heard that sound and Doc singing it, for me, there was this moment where I just knew I was hearing \u2014 and I should preface this that I was really immersed in China at this point and loving Chinese culture and studying the language really intensely and been there a number of times. And when I heard Doc Watson, I felt like I heard the beauty of authentic American culture. And I wanted it so badly. I\u2019d been looking for it so badly. And I finally heard it when I heard Doc, this high, lonesome, searching, struggling, suffering, hopeful voice singing this ancient, ancient melody and these old, old words. And it didn\u2019t matter who owned it or where it came from, but this man was sharing it with me. And I knew that I had to go get a banjo, and I had to learn \u201CShady Grove.\u201D And instead of doing karaoke in China with my clients when I would become a lawyer someday, I would play ballads from Appalachia, of course, so. So it was like \u2014 can I throw something in? Yeah. For me, what I think \u2014 the word I thought of when you were talking about that, what you actually heard was the truth, something that was the truth. And I think that the greatest musicians that \u2014 when I think about even like B.B. King, who we just lost, about Earl Scruggs, and even Miles Davis, some of these people that played something that somehow seemed so profound. And these were just instrumentalists \u2014 Abby\u2019s talking about Doc Watson, who could use words \u2014 but it just sounds so true, even though it\u2019s just notes. There\u2019s something more about it. And this notion of roots, like roots music, which, again, it\u2019s kind of a \u2014 it\u2019s language we throw around. But when you start talking about what the music conveys and where it comes from you realize how deep that is and what it touches in us. Well, something that I learned from a movie that B\u00E9la made \u2014 and this isn\u2019t a plug, this is just the truth. I watched B\u00E9la\u2019s documentary, Throw Down Your Heart. And you called me on your big global phone from over in Africa a number of times. And I think it was when you were in Tanzania. He was learning the story of how, on that side, the journey of the banjo to America happened. You were tracing the original roots of the banjo in Africa. Yeah. And what he had learned and part of the reason the documentary is called Throw Down Your Heart is because, as people were being boarded onto the slave ships, they said, \u201CThrow your heart down here. You\u2019re not going to want to carry it to where you\u2019re going.\u201D And a lot of the slave masters figured out that if they had a banjo player onboard playing the music of home, more of the cargo would live to the other side. So the origins of the banjo in America are the bitterest of roots. It makes me want to cry just thinking about it in this moment. And it formed an amazing origin to what became a blend of traditions from Africa, Ireland, and Scotland, when those banjo players from Africa and those fiddlers from Scotland and Ireland started playing plantation dances together. That\u2019s what really started what we know of as that early Appalachian and that early American sound. And that sound is based in this bitter root, but with this actual hope \u2014 this hope that I can live, that I can live, I can survive. It\u2019s an amazing tradition. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, in conversation with banjo icons B\u00E9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn at the Belcourt Theater in Nashville, Tennessee. To this idea of the reality and the truth in this music, there\u2019s a story you told. The first track on your new album, which is your first album together, is \u201CI\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad,\u201D which you sing in a minor key. But I love this, this story that you told about how \u2014 maybe this isn\u2019t true either. Correct me if I heard this on the internet. Well, our publicist writes a lot of these stories. So yeah, maybe. B\u00E9la, you were traveling, and Abigail, you were home with Juno. Yes. And Juno was banging on the table? Yeah. I was so proud of him. You got really excited about that, which this is a life lesson for other parents who are not musicians because you thought he\u2019s learning rhythms. Yes. Banging on the table. I was so excited, yes. Because he was banging in time. It was consistent. He was banging in time? Are you sure? Close enough. That\u2019s a fair question. But then what I remembered is somebody \u2014 when I was learning to cross-country ski in Minnesota, somebody taught me how to keep my pace by singing \u201CI\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad.\u201D And I think \u2014 here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I think a lot of people might think, \u201COh, bluegrass music or folk music is not my music, is not my taste.\u201D And yet so much of this music is woven into our lives in ways that we don\u2019t ever \u2014 don\u2019t even reflect on. Yeah. I don\u2019t think \u2014 well, let me put it this way. Some bluegrass music might not be your taste, but some other bluegrass music might be. And if you just let the name \u201Cbluegrass\u201D repel you because you just heard some bluegrass you didn\u2019t like, you\u2019ll miss out on a bunch of great music. And I think, whenever we decide we don\u2019t like a kind of music, we\u2019re the one that loses because there\u2019s always something in every field that\u2019s beautiful, that you would like. Yeah. I\u2019d like to circle back to China. And you two have also \u2014 you\u2019ve gone to China as well, right? I know you were back there. Yeah, I\u2019ve been there three times. And one time we got to go to Tibet together. And it was apparently one of the first American and Chinese sponsored trips over there, which was a pretty incredible experience for both of \u2014 all of us. We were with the Sparrow Quartet at that time, with Casey Driessen and Ben Sollee. And we had a pretty incredible experience over there. Yeah. Have you also been over there kind of not just taking this music, but also collecting their music and doing some\u2026? Well, you did your Silk Road Trip. Yeah, I\u2019ve done a number. On almost every trip I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve tried to collaborate with somebody locally, no matter where I end up. And that led to meeting the most incredible, wonderful local musicians all over China. So I feel like I have gotten to jam and play with Uyghurs, Tibetans, Mongolians, Dong people, Han \u2014 wonderful Han folk music players from all over China. And I have one really memorable experience that was of being in a city and calling ahead and asking for someone to come. And this old man showed up backstage, and he had an erhu case. And an erhu is a little two-stringed instrument, actually, but the bow goes in between both of the strings. And it sounds\u2026 Snakeskin covered\u2026 Snakeskin covered. \u2026banjo, really, but it\u2019s a violin. Yeah. Tiny, tiny head, and it sits on your knee, and you play it. It sounds like a human voice almost. Really? It sounds like a human voice to some and a dying cat to others. It really depends. And he showed up, and he saw me in this wonderful band of musicians that I was there with from America. And he just didn\u2019t look happy at all. He looked at me, he said, \u2014 \u201CAmericans and Chinese simply cannot play music together. It\u2019s too different.\u201D And I looked at him and I was like, \u201COh, OK. Well, would you just play for us then?\u201D [speaks Chinese]. And he pulled out his erhu, and he started playing this breathtakingly gorgeous melody from Tibet, actually. And the band, as we were listening, we just started to tune up our instruments to match his tuning, and we just started playing along with him. And you could see this \u2014 it was barely there, but you could see just that corner of his mouth kind of turn up ever so slightly. And that night, we performed that song that we created in that moment for 1,400 people in a theater in that town. And at the end of the show, he came up to me and he said \u2014 \u2014 \u201CTonight I discovered something.\u201D [speaks Chinese] \u201CIt\u2019s not that Americans and Chinese can\u2019t play music together\u201D \u2014 [speaks Chinese]\u2014 \u201Cit\u2019s just that music is actually the communication of hearts.\u201D This is Abigail Washburn and her band jamming with a group of Uyghur musicians around the dinner table in western China as part of that Silk Road Tour. You can find a link to video of this encounter on our website, onbeing.org. There, you can also, as always, listen again and share this conversation with Abigail Washburn and B\u00E9la Fleck. Again, that\u2019s onbeing.org. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with B\u00E9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn. He is one of the greatest living banjo players. She is a celebrated clawhammer banjo player and singer, a passionate explorer of the folk traditions of both America and China. And they are partners \u2014 in music and in life \u2014 recovering something ancient and deeply American all at once; bringing both beauty and meaning to what they play and how they live. Nashville Public Radio brought us together in their hometown \u2014 in front of a live audience at the Belcourt Theater. B\u00E8la, you have said the first time you heard Abigail\u2019s music, you were listening in the car, and you got stopped for speeding. Yeah, yeah. It was out in Franklin. There was a party. Because you were just so caught up in the\u2026 That\u2019s so romantic. Yeah, she gave me \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s not really the first time. It\u2019s been slightly sanitized, the story. But the first time I heard her, it was at the party, and she was playing these very, very sad, slow songs with a bunch of girls gathered around her. And I was going, \u201CThis is just not for me.\u201D It was just really slow. And it was beautiful, but I was like, \u201CYeah, OK. She\u2019s good.\u201D But then she gave me this CD at this party, and I started listening to it. And I had a completely different experience because the banjo was up front. There was this groove to it. And she was singing like you just heard her, with this ancient sound, very connected to traditional music. And I just started driving faster and faster and going, \u201CWow, I really like this.\u201D I think I was even talking to myself. And then I got pulled over and had to walk the line. It seems to me, B\u00E9la, that your story is also about kind of \u2014 as much as it\u2019s about traveling through places, it\u2019s about traveling through genres, kind of, I don\u2019t know, as an old Star Trek lover, taking the banjo where no banjo has gone before. Or at least maybe we don\u2019t all know that it\u2019s gone there before. [laughs] Wait, could you do that, Abby? I can\u2019t remember it. How does it go? That\u2019s good. Yeah, although, I\u2019m more of a Next Generation fan. Oh. And there are clearly people in the audience who know what we\u2019re talking about. I have to say, the titles of the Flecktones albums are really intriguing. Flight of the Cosmic Hippo. By the way, we had a bus driver recently, and he said, \u201CMan, I love the Flecktones.\u201D I said, \u201CReally?\u201D He said, \u201CYeah, I got your album.\u201D I said, \u201CWhich album?\u201D He said, \u201CI have the one with the pig on the cover.\u201D Which one was that? Flight of the Cosmic Hippo. Flight of the Cosmic Hippo? So it didn\u2019t have a hippo on the cover? It had a hippo on the cover. It did have a hippo on it. I see. OK. And then there\u2019s UFO Tofu. That\u2019s a palindrome. It spells the same thing backwards. And so \u2014 we had a long piece\u2026 Oh, I see. Yeah, it does. We had a musical piece that was a palindrome that was about five minutes long that all went forward and went backwards. It had about six different palindromes buried within it. And so we used to tell stories about palindromes before we\u2019d do that song. And that one popped up. A guy named Baby Gramps told us about that one and \u2014 yeah. That\u2019s great. And then, Three Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. Yeah, we were searching hard at that point. Yeah, you\u2019ve got to \u2014 you really hit the peak with UFO Tofu palindromes. We did a show \u2014 we did an event in New York City in the fall about Bach \u2014 it was during the Bach month \u2014 with a computer scientist and a Bach lover. And we actually put this recording, this amazing recording of you playing Bach\u2019s \u201CPartita for Violin No. 3\u201D on the banjo on our website. It was so gorgeous. You have incredible taste. Thank you. But I was then also really amazed to learn that you\u2019ve written a concerto for banjo with the \u2014 and you did it with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, with an 80-piece symphony orchestra. Very intrigued by the title, The Impostor, that you gave to that. Would you talk about that? Sure. Yeah. And really, The Impostor \u2014 Abby and I have talked about feeling like you\u2019re the outsider, you\u2019re the other, you know? Yeah, it kind of comes back to this idea that the banjo\u2019s not a real instrument. Yeah. And especially \u2014 and I realized at some point that \u2014 not always, but often putting myself in positions where the banjo hasn\u2019t been played before. So I have to figure out a role for the banjo with Indian musicians or with Chinese musicians or with classical musicians or with jazz musicians. And the only place I really know exactly what the banjo is supposed to do is bluegrass. That\u2019s the place where I know exactly what almost every banjo player of note has played since Earl Scruggs from \u2014 till now. I know how they would do things, and I can make my choices based on an understanding. But everywhere else, I\u2019m kind of waiting for somebody to say, \u201CHey, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here. Get out of here.\u201D So that\u2019s a feeling that I sometimes get when I\u2019m feeling insecure, like somebody\u2019s going to catch me and kick me out. And so with The Impostor, playing in front of a symphony orchestra and writing the piece and everything too, I had my ears peeled for somebody to eject me. And then there\u2019s this place at the very end where the banjo kind of breaks free from the rest of the orchestra and \u2014 what did that symbolize to you? Well, in writing the piece, I was making a serious attempt not to do an Appalachian Concerto. But by the end of the piece, I was really \u2014 I had been trying hard to complete this piece. And I wasn\u2019t coming up with a big ending. Right. And that\u2019s when desperately I reached for Earl Scruggs, and he was there for me. And not only that, I dedicated the piece to Earl Scruggs and got to play it for him before the premier. And he came to the premier. And it was the last concert that he came to. Really? Yeah, and he passed away maybe five or six months later. Oh. So it was a \u2014 some closure there. But he was very sweet. It felt to me like you really have come full circle. Isn\u2019t there a song in your album you\u2019ve done together from B\u00E9la Bartok? Oh, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. So you\u2019ve actually come back to your namesake. Well, really, when I started writing that piece, that was when I finally said, \u201CLook, I got to get into this Bartok stuff. It\u2019s just \u2014 people just keep asking me, \u201COh, you must really be a Bartok fan because he was always exploring folk music and classical music.\u201D And I\u2019m like, \u201CWell, I really haven\u2019t heard very much of it.\u201D And I think I \u2014 because of the complexity of my relationship with the person who gave me that name, I wasn\u2019t eager to embrace it. But at the point when when I was writing this piece, it was like, \u201COK. Let\u2019s just deal with all of this stuff.\u201D Yeah. And so I started listening\u2026 And you had met your father at that point? Yeah. A lot of the sort of Darth Vader-ism had sort of subsided by making him into a real person. And then I was ready to go face Bartok, which turned out to be some of the greatest music I ever heard. Really? Oh, my God. Really? It\u2019s so different. It\u2019s so free from convention and imaginative. I love it. I really do. So, yeah, I found a couple of piano pieces and arranged them for Abby and I to play on the new album. That was the first Bartok that I\u2019ve done. But I\u2019d like to actually try to learn a violin concerto on the banjo and things like that. That\u2019d be a lot of fun. I\u2019ve seen you both talk about the music you do together in terms of dialog and conversation. Well, that\u2019s Abby. Like, I am not a talker. This is a lot for me. OK, you\u2019re doing really well. Thank you, thank you. You\u2019re really holding your own. But if you came to a Flecktones show, maybe there would be speaking two or three times in the whole night, and it would be brief. But Abby is a great storyteller, and she reaches out to the audience and really gets to know them and talks a lot. So I\u2019ve had to learn to come to terms with that and participate in that as well. We\u2019d get offstage after the first couple of shows, and he\u2019d say, \u201CUm, I don\u2019t know how to put this, but could we talk a little less, maybe?\u201D Because we only had time for like five songs in a two-hour set. I was trying to get this song to time ratio up a little bit. OK. All right. But I didn\u2019t necessarily \u2014 so there is the literal conversation. But there\u2019s also the kind of dialog between the banjo and the voice, and also the dialog between \u2014 when you\u2019re both playing the banjo, different kinds of banjo and different styles and \u2014 right? Oh, on stage, like as a part of our performance? Yeah, yeah. Yes. I think a real intention when we were finally taking our thing together seriously \u2014 not just our love for one another, but our ability to perform together, which really hit when we realized we\u2019re going to have a baby. So we decided that we needed to really make an effort to put out something in the world that was like a formal offering, musically, as a duo. So that we could travel together and not be split up like so many couples that have babies and one of the two of them travel. So we decided we\u2019d throw our forces together\u2026 Just hit the road. \u2026and take the baby with us. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for the last couple of years. Yeah. And so when we were planning our record, we thought, \u201CWe know that two banjos and a vocal can be a really wonderful thing, but we have to \u2014 we actually do have to prove it.\u201D So we decided to create soundscapes that differed from track to track and that differed from song to song, which meant including different types of banjos. Back in the late 1800s, there were actual banjo orchestras all over America, and they were really popular. There were big, double-banjo basses with end pens that people stood and played, and they looked like Taiko drums with strings on them, and piccolo banjos, and banjo-ukes, and banjolins \u2014 and it goes on \u2014 banjo-cellos. Why did that go away? Why? Exactly, right? Yeah. I mean, why do we not even know this? On your album, as well, this album you produced together, there\u2019s one song called \u201CBanjo, Banjo\u201D \u2014 one tune called \u201CBanjo, Banjo,\u201D that in the liner notes says that you sat down and made that music when you first felt Juno kick. I have to say, it\u2019s enviable to think about this being part of your marriage and your friendship and relationship and a way that you can celebrate, you know? You can literally make music together. It\u2019s great. I mean, we\u2019re constantly amazed by our situation. Yeah. It\u2019s a sweet, sweet situation. Probably the hardest thing to do is to find time to make new music. Because we wake up in the morning with Juno on the bus. And the first thing we want to do is just go play with him and be with him, and so we do that. We spend several hours together with Juno until he falls asleep for his nap. And then we\u2019re wiped out. And then we\u2019re tired. Yeah, well, and I do have to say, because I have been watching the TV show, Nashville\u2026 Oh, yeah. Me too. \u2026I am aware that this juggling music \u2014 making music and a relationship can be challenging. I don\u2019t know how Rayna does it. I really don\u2019t know. I know. And now Juliette. Oh, my. What do you all think about having this Nashville TV show? Is it just a soap opera? Is it fun? Oh, it\u2019s just fun. Fun? It\u2019s like a \u2014 it\u2019s a guilty pleasure. For me, too. I mean, we\u2019ve \u2014 all the musicians that I know from here, we all love it. It\u2019s good \u2014 it\u2019s neat to see our friends that are in the show. Occasionally, we see people who are extras on the show, or we hear people playing, and see all the places we know. So, yeah. We get a kick out of it. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. Today, with musicians B\u00E8la Fleck and Abigail Washburn in a public conversation at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. Oh, this is fun. Something also that intrigued me, actually, neither one of you has a really extensive professional training, right? I mean, and \u2014 this is, you really came to this very late. But B\u00E9la, I mean, you are the premier banjo player, possibly, in the world. And, Abigail, I have to say, when I first experienced the two of you, I also assumed that you were somebody who\u2019d grown up learning this. And you play with B\u00E9la Fleck. And the two of you are this banjo-playing duo. And when you were pregnant, some music reporter said, \u201CAnd now they will give birth to the holy banjo emperor.\u201D Right? But part of what you\u2019ve been out there talking about \u2014 and you delivered the commencement address for Colorado College, for your alma mater. And you talked a lot about this way you were open to experience. And you really discovered this thing that has become defining. And in fact, you\u2019re helping to define this kind of music now and the culture. But it was very unexpected. And you didn\u2019t prepare for it all your life and in a linear way. Well, a piece of my story that I don\u2019t really ever tell because it just adds another 30 seconds is \u2014 the fact that when I left Vermont on my road trip to go south, before I was headed to China to become a lawyer, my very first stop was at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies, and I spent five days meditating. And it was the first time I ever meditated in my whole life. And to this day, it\u2019s one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done, to sit still. My body ached. I became afraid I was hurting myself. And I went into the darkest place. And one day, I remember I was sitting there. It must have been three days in or something, and I went into this very deep place. Finally, I wasn\u2019t really thinking a whole lot, and I came out of it hours later, and my entire shirt was covered with tears and boogers. I mean, it was not pretty. And in that moment, I stood up, and nobody was in the room. They had all left. And I know that I had let go of something major. I\u2019m not even totally sure what it is to this day. But I know that I didn\u2019t really feel like a victim anymore when I left that place. I felt like I was clean and fresh and pure, and I could make my decisions. And that, within days, I was in Louisville, Kentucky, playing the four songs I knew on the banjo and was offered a record deal in Nashville, Tennessee. I came to Nashville instead of going to China to go to law school. And I felt ready for that. I felt ready. That\u2019s all I can say. Were you always a singer? Or did that come later too? Yeah, I always loved singing. I was in choir all through school. And I\u2019d always try out for the solos, and I never got them. So I really didn\u2019t fancy myself much of a singer. I didn\u2019t think I was going to be perceived as a good singer. See, that\u2019s what I got out of getting ready to talk to you. You don\u2019t really consider yourself to be a great musician. No, no. You don\u2019t \u2014 you feel like this is something you came to late \u2014 this imposter language. I mean, you\u2019re \u2014 I don\u2019t think you do feel like an imposter because you throw yourself into it so joyfully. Yeah. But you don\u2019t think of yourself the way other people think of you as a musician. Right. No, I don\u2019t. But that is no harm nor foul to how I feel about the music. Yeah. And I feel like music, just like most of my life, I hope that it\u2019s a service to people. This goes back to my childhood. Yeah. I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019m continually, through the music, cultivating myself to have compassion and empathy and to express that to people. And that \u2014 I was talking to my mom today as we were walking around the lake, trying to just think of things from my childhood and not forget too much when I talked to you tonight. And I was remembering what a sensitive child I was. I was so tuned in to everybody\u2019s feelings. And it was a beautiful thing because I saw people\u2019s feelings before I saw them. And now I consider it a great gift. But at the time, I didn\u2019t know how to manage it. And so I felt darkness a lot because I immediately would recognize people feeling darkness. Right. And my whole life, I\u2019ve had to learn how to manage that. And a beautiful thing is that a song teaches me to manage that because I feel something so strong. Most songs I choose to sing, unless they\u2019re\u2026 Because a song becomes a container for it? It\u2019s a container for the empathy and for the sensitivity. So I can feel something so strongly. Like, I\u2019ve been singing the song \u201CCome All You Coal Miners\u201D that was written by an amazing woman named Sarah Ogan Gunning. And she was raised in a coal camp. And her child starved to death because they couldn\u2019t get milk for her baby, and her husband died of black lung, and all of these things. I hear her story, and I\u2019m crying, and I\u2019m crying, and I start to sing this song. \u201CCome all you coal miners wherever you may be / And listen to a story that I\u2019ll relate to thee / My name is nothing extra, but the truth to you I\u2019ll tell / I am a coal miner\u2019s wife, I\u2019m sure I wish you well. / They\u2019ll take your very life blood, they\u2019ll take your children\u2019s lives / Take fathers away from children, and husbands away from wives. / Coal miner, won\u2019t you organize wherever you may be / And make this a land of freedom for workers like you and me. / Dear miner, they will slave you \u2019til you can\u2019t work no more / And what\u2019ll you get for your living but a dollar at the company store / A tumbled-down shack to live in, snow and rain pours in the top. / You have to pay the company rent, and your pain it never stops. / I am a coal miner\u2019s wife, I\u2019m sure I wish you well. / Let\u2019s sink this capitalist system in the darkest pits of hell.\u201D That actually was a kind of an amazing demonstration of something that I was going to read to you, B\u00E9la. This was somebody \u2014 this was from a blog called the Rabbi\u2019s Pen. Have you ever heard this? My crack producer, Lily, found this for me. \u201CSpiritual reflections on B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones.\u201D By a who? A rabbi. Huh? I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find the Rabbi\u2019s name. \u201CMusic is a language, a way of\u2026 I might have posted this. You might have. All right. Well, we\u2019ll take it with a grain of salt. \u201CMusic is a language, a way of communicating, a vehicle for bringing greater peace, tolerance, and humor into our own hearts and into the world. Music is a spiritual discipline and a great teacher. Great musicians, like B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones, are also great teachers.\u201D Do you ever think of yourself as a teacher? Is that\u2026? I don\u2019t know. I mean, I know there are people that learn from what I do. And it\u2019s exciting to see people that have taken what I do and built on it, just the way I\u2019ve built on Earl Scruggs and Tony Trischka and so many great people that I learned from. Yeah. This person also said, \u201CAt the Ryman Auditorium, B\u00E9la Fleck took a few moments to honor one of his teachers, the late Earl Scruggs. There was a palpable sense of reverence and holiness throughout the auditorium, as many of us understood the great love that emerges when true teaching and learning have occurred.\u201D Well, there\u2019s a lot you can do with instrumental music. And sometimes we tend to sideline it and think of it as background music or support for vocals. Like, a lot of times \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been playing with somebody for an audience, and the singer sings, and then as soon as we go into the instrumental part, people start talking. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is. Really? It could be with some of the greatest musicians in the world. It\u2019s like a go-to. \u201COh, that\u2019s not the main thing.\u201D But go to India, you might have a very different experience of a spiritual experience listening to music. It doesn\u2019t have to be India, wherever you hear it. Or even people hearing the great German classical music, or Chopin, can have a pretty ecstatic experience through the works of human beings. And the pieces that I\u2019ve come up with that have a strong mood or that kind of a component, I couldn\u2019t explain to you what I was going for when I was trying to write them. I might have found a sound that expressed a feeling or a mood that I tried to write a piece around. And I couldn\u2019t explain what that mood is even, but someone who listened to it would know exactly what I was talking about. We are drawing to a close. And we\u2019re going to hear a little bit more music from you. I often will kind of circle around to this question of what you\u2019ve learned through the life you\u2019ve lived about what it means to be human, and how perhaps that has evolved since your early days, things that you know now, or believe now, or experience now that would have surprised you then. I was in China after the big earthquake in 2008. I hope I\u2019m right about that. The years are flying by now that I have a baby. They will continue to fly by. That\u2019s what I hear. And with a friend of mine, we were making \u2014 Dave Liang of The Shanghai Restoration Project \u2014 we were making a record with the kids. And this actually happened before we came back to make the record. I went there just to see what I could do, because I had spent a lot of time in Sichuan. My great teacher, who taught me my tremendous love for China, Old Lady Wong, is from Sichuan. And they said, \u201CWhy don\u2019t you just come play some music for the kids at these relocation schools.\u201D And the kids were struggling so much. I mean, they were not only taken away from their homes, but they had lost a lot of family members, and they were living in these temporary trailers in a place they didn\u2019t know at all, with just their teachers there and their fellow students. And at the end of my performances, the kids would always come up to me, and they\u2019d say, \u201CYou sang for us. Now we want to sing for you.\u201D And so most of my \u2014 I would listen to, like, 90 pop songs, Chinese pop songs, you know? Just\u2026 [snaps fingers] And it was very cute and fun. But this one girl came up to me, and she said, , which means \u201CBig Sister Wong\u201D \u2014 Washburn is Wong. [speaks Chinese] \u2014 \u201CBig Sister Wong, I want to sing you a song that my mother taught me. And my mother died in the earthquake.\u201D And so she sat down in my lap, and she started singing to me. And tears started coming down my face, and she started to cry too. I had this moment where I just saw this light shining from her and from me. And I felt so very connected to her and to everyone. And I just knew that I wanted to live \u2014 and I do want to live in that light as much as possible, with her and with you and with everyone. And that\u2019s how I try to live my life. Yeah. That is so lame. He\u2019s so sweet. OK, your turn. I didn\u2019t bring any tissues up here. B\u00E9la Fleck. Aw. What was the question, again? What does the banjo teach you about life? That\u2019s a better way to do it. That\u2019s a good question. Well, you know, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s where I put my energy. I feel like everybody \u2014 you\u2019ve got a certain amount of energy in your life to devote to various things. And I\u2019ve been putting most of my energy into the banjo for most of my life. And actually, what\u2019s interesting \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m learning as much about life right now from having a child with Abby. And Juno is a great teacher. And I\u2019m what you\u2019d call a Type A, psychotic musician. I\u2019ve lived that way up till now, where I could make music the thing, the most important thing in the world. And in a way, I thought that was \u2014 that\u2019s my job. My job is to \u2014 and I know it\u2019s not true \u2014 but make believe that the banjo and what happens with the banjo is the most important thing in the world. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m \u2014 that\u2019s what I do. That\u2019s my job. That\u2019s the privilege I get to experience\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s been your calling. \u2026is just like a great physicist has to believe that\u2019s the most important thing in the world to do the kind of work he wants to do. But once you have a kid, all of a sudden, it\u2019s clearly not the most important thing in the world. And so there\u2019s a lot of growing up that comes with that. So the challenges now are how to keep the commitment that I made to this guy, while keeping the commitment that I made to this girl and the little guy who\u2019s at home. The holy banjo emperor. Yeah, the holy banjo emperor. So, that\u2019s a challenge. But we\u2019re figuring it out together. And I\u2019m finding that it\u2019s OK not to wake up and go work on hard music all day, and just stop and spend all morning with watching this little kid full of wonder at these things. That\u2019s the best I can do. Well, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s been a real joy and an honor to dive deeply into what you do and who you are. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in the world. And thank you for making yourself available for this. And thank you, all of you, for coming. And now they\u2019re going to play some music for us again. All right. This is an old song that was recorded on a porch in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina in the 1930s. Abigail Washburn\u2019s albums include Song of the Traveling Daughter and City of Refuge. B\u00E9la Fleck has recorded over 40 albums, most famously with The Flecktones and New Grass Revival. Their first full album collaboration, called B\u00E9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn, was awarded the 2016 Grammy for Best Folk Album."
