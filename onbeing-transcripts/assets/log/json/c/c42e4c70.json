Today, a conversation about global business ethics and what my guest, Prabhu Guptara, calls \u201Cthe gods of business.\u201D He reflects on such ideas for one of the world\u2019s largest Swiss banks. A generation of people has grown up \u2014 particularly those who occupy high positions in politics, economics, the media and all the rest of it \u2014 who have no transcendent values, or, if they have transcendent values, they have no means of intellectually reconciling those transcendent values with the way they do business. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. My guest this hour, global business analyst Prabhu Guptara, has fascinating perspective on how an Enron scandal can happen and why it matters to people around the world. He explains how the United States can be one of the world\u2019s most religious countries, yet, at the same time, a culture in which moral values can fail to penetrate the workplace. From American Public Media, this is Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. Today, \u201CThe Gods of Business.\u201D In Houston today, federal prosecutors presented their opening statement in the case that the judge calls \u201Cone of the most interesting and important cases ever tried.\u201D It has been four years since the Enron Corporation collapsed in an accounting scandal that still reverberates on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms. Including that their advisers, their accountants and their lawyers told them it was OK to do what they did, they also may say that what they\u2019re being charged with wasn\u2019t actually illegal, it was just business. I am in my 60s and should be retired at this point, but I will have to continue to work because I lost about 75 percent of my retirement in Enron stock. \u2026going to be to present this as a clear-cut case of criminality. They\u2019re going to show the jury that on the one hand, the defendants were aware that Enron was in serious financial trouble, and, at the very same time, they were turning around and telling the investing public something entirely different. Prabhu Guptara reflects on such headlines and scandals for one of the world\u2019s richest and most influential banks, the Union Bank of Switzerland, better known as UBS. Every central bank in the world with more than $1 billion in assets is a client of UBS, where Guptara creates and directs executive and organizational development programs. He also writes and lectures widely on globalization, financial services, business ethics and religious values. He\u2019s long pursued a curiosity about how religious traditions function as worldviews and how these traditions interact with the way human beings conduct business. I asked Prabhu Guptara how he first came to this. I guess I started thinking about it when I was about 16. And the reason was that I was really facing the issue: How is it that a highly religious country like India is also at the same time so highly corrupt? And why is it that when people claim that we\u2019ve had a massively beautiful, wonderful history in the past, which obviously we did, we are in such a mess at the present? And is there any relationship between the philosophies we followed in the past and the philosophies we are following at present? Everybody claims there is, but if there is, then clearly the philosophy had nothing to do with our success in the past and our failure at the moment. So where does all this fit together? And, of course, since I work for a business now and I worked for a bit of a business then, I was asking the question how does the fact that somebody\u2019s highly spiritual relate or not relate to their business practices? As he considers such questions, Prabhu Guptara looks at different teachings and emphases across the world\u2019s traditions. For example, he says, Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism emphasize social order. Where business is concerned, they offer their followers commonsense advice more than spiritual principles. Judaism stresses the character of God as a model for life and work. Islam stresses the will of God. Christianity promotes human transformation, even transformation of the workplace. But Prabhu Guptara has observed that business is rarely defined by the particularities of the faith of executives and employees. He\u2019s seen a more ecumenical and transnational human tendency to separate one\u2019s private values from one\u2019s approach to work. \u201CIt is possible,\u201D he says, \u201Cto be religious but not ethical when it comes to economics.\u201D He knew this first in his own Hindu upbringing. I come from a caste that has been business people for 2,300 years at least. And we are allowed by our religion, we are, in fact, encouraged by our religion, to charge whatever level of interest we want. And so, over the years, we have charged as much as 3,600 percent interest because the market will bear it. And we have reduced tens of thousands of people \u2014 tens of millions of people to slavery, virtual slavery, serfdom, over the years because they were not able to pay back the interest on loans that we gave them. So, clearly, it was possible to be highly religious in business, as most members of my caste are, but at the same time highly unethical, or at least highly unhuman or inhuman. So, \u201CHow do all these things fit together?\u201D were questions that were bothering me, and that\u2019s really why I started exploring them. In the world today, you can think of most people in the world falling into, I guess, two or three different categories. One, people who don\u2019t see that their values \u2014 wherever their values may come from \u2014 have anything specific to do with their business practice. They\u2019re just trying to follow good professional ethics. And I guess most people in the world fall into that category. They don\u2019t really think about where those business ethics have come from or professional ethics have come from. And that would be most people, regardless of how devout their religious tradition might be or their different religious traditions. That\u2019s my experience. I mean, it doesn\u2019t really matter if they\u2019re Muslims or Hindus or Buddhists or Christians or atheists or what. You know, if they run a business, they try to run a business that\u2019s decent, legal, honest, truthful and all the rest of it. You know, they just want to make a decent sum of money in a decent way, most people. Of course, there are a few people who are highly greedy and who will do whatever it takes, including cutting corners and being unethical and all that, in order to make money. They will do whatever they can get away with in order to make a lot of money very quickly. And it doesn\u2019t matter what their theoretical religious background is\u2026 They might also be very religious. They might also be very religious, yes. And then you\u2019ll find an equally small minority \u2014 by equally small, I mean as small as those who are very highly greedy and so on \u2014 you\u2019ll find an equally small minority that wrestles with questions of \u201CIs this the right way to make money? Am I making too much money? What is the effect of my business on my clients? What is the effect of my business on my suppliers? What is the effect of my business on the environment? How do I square the amount of money I\u2019m making with my responsibilities in a world of extreme need?\u201D And, again, in my experience, it doesn\u2019t matter what the religious background of the people is, there is a small minority of people that is concerned about that kind of issue. You have a very large presentation that you make in which you lay out the different approaches to business in the five predominant, largest religious traditions, in which you group Christianity, Islam and Judaism together, and then you also talk about Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism and atheism. A place I believe you come out is that those religious traditions and those worldviews make themselves felt in many ways, but that, in fact, the god of business that is most prominent \u2014 the culture of business \u2014 has become atheist. Is that too extreme? I would say that is too extreme. If you look at the ethics of most businesses and if you look in most professional ethics and you say, \u201CWhich religious tradition do these square with most?\u201D you will see that they square really with the Jewish and Christian traditions \u2014 marginally with the Muslim tradition because Muslim tradition belongs to the same Abrahamic family of faiths \u2014 and doesn\u2019t really square with Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, African tribal religion and so on and so forth. And is that true of business even in China or in India? Yes, because you find that the most, within quotes, \u201Cdeveloped\u201D or \u201Csophisticated\u201D business practice goes in the direction of what we might describe as international business practice \u2014 international best business practice. And international best business practice comes out of the Jewish and Christian tradition. I mean, take a simple thing like no bargaining. In most, you know, the more established the market becomes \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter which part of the world you\u2019re in \u2014 the less haggling and negotiation is a mark of that market. This tradition was really started by Jewish and Christian people who believe in the value of time and said, \u201CTime is so important that the amount of time that\u2019s wasted in negotiation can be \u2014 and in haggling in marketplaces \u2014 can be reduced if we just go for a fair price that is fixed. And provided I\u2019m making a decent return, I don\u2019t have to start at 300 percent of what I\u2019m expecting to get or 1,000 percent of what I\u2019m expecting to get. I can just start with what I expect to get.\u201D And that has become established over time as being international business practice. But where it comes from is the value of time vs. the value of money. If time is the most important thing in life, then you shouldn\u2019t waste it haggling. So you\u2019re saying that there are very real ways and very practical ways in which a Jewish/Christian ethic has infused international business practices. But is that the same as creating ethical cultures within workplaces and corporate cultures? That is a rather more difficult or different issue. And it\u2019s equally possible for somebody from an atheistic point of view or from a Buddhist point of view or a Muslim point of view or an African tribal point of view to create an ethical culture as it is from somebody from a Jewish or Christian point of view. And, in fact, it\u2019s not necessarily the case that somebody who is Jewish or Christian and owns a business is necessarily going to create an ethical culture. For example, in China and in Japan, in one case, it was Marxism \u2014 in the case of China \u2014 it was Marxism that cleaned up the country and made it relatively straight till, of course, now, market practices have come in and the country\u2019s gone back to a kind of corruption. In the case of Japan, it was national sentiment, you know, the desire at the end of the Second World War to catch up with the West. So it was a kind of nationalistic religion, nationalistic fervor which cleaned up business to a very large extent, of course, not completely. African nationalism cleaned up a lot of business practices. And, of course, now they\u2019ve slipped back again, because the issue is not just whether you can create this kind of national or corporate drive to create a culture which is ethical. You can do it within one generation \u2014 that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s relatively easy \u2014 but whether you can sustain that over two or three generations, that is a challenge. Global business analyst Prabhu Guptara. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. We\u2019re talking about what Prabhu Guptara calls \u201Cthe gods of business.\u201D He works at one of the world\u2019s most influential banks. From that vantage point, he\u2019s become increasingly concerned about inequities that the global economy can fuel. In recent months, natural calamities across the world have brought some of these into high relief and underscored their human cost; so, in a positive way, have the efforts of high-profile philanthropists and humanitarians, notably Microsoft\u2019s Bill and Melinda Gates. Prabhu Guptara believes that the future viability of even the most successful enterprises will require that they address excessive inequalities. Here\u2019s a reading from an address he published and delivered in London called Ethics Across Cultures. I have no issue with people earning lots of money. I do have a problem when, for example, in the richest country in the world, the U.S.A., we have a population in which 70 percent has no net wealth. Over the past 20 years, real wages have declined for 80 percent of the population. And this is not an issue only in the U.S.A., it is a worldwide trend today. I think most of us have no problem with a system which allows reasonable accumulation of wealth gained in return for the exertion of intelligence, industry, risk-taking and sheer effort. But I think most people in the world do have a problem with a system which allows unlimited accumulation of wealth at the same time as allowing millions of people to have nothing when they are exerting as much energy and intelligence as other people. Three thousand five hundred children died today because they had no food or water. Three thousand five hundred will die tomorrow for the same reasons, and the day after and every day \u2014 until you and I decide to do something about it. What was merely a tragedy yesterday is today a tragedy as well as an obscenity, for we live in a time of oversupply of all basic goods for the first time in history, which makes it entirely unnecessary for anyone to starve or have no clothes or to have no roof of some basic sort over their heads. From an address in London by Prabhu Guptara. For all his concern about the human costs of the global economy, Prabhu Guptara doesn\u2019t concentrate blame on the nature of business itself. The global economy, he says, simply magnifies the fact that, as they grow, businesses affect the world around them. That means to say, if you have a factory, the factory is going to produce certain pollutants. As you deal in business, you may be driving competitors out of business. And the question, as we are today in a globalized economy, is how can we organize the whole of the global economy in a way that makes sense for the maximum number of people in the world? I think the U.S. secretary for labor went on record in 1999 saying that the majority of the benefits of the boom \u2014 the greatest boom the world had ever seen for the 10 years or so between 1989 and 1999 \u2014 the vast majority of the benefit of that boom went to 1 percent of the U.S. population. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a lot of benefit going to a very small number of people, but till recently, you see, we were forced to make a choice because we had limited resources. And by \u201Ctill recently,\u201D I mean till 50 years ago. Even at the end of the Second World War, we lived in a world in which we were constrained by resource shortage. And everybody remembers at the end of the Second World War \u2014 certainly when I\u2019m sitting here in Europe or in Switzerland \u2014 that there were long lines of people waiting who had pieces of card in their hand on the basis of which they could go to the shop and get their quarter-kilo of sugar or their loaf of bread or their two ounces of meat per week. Now, of course, we live in a world of such enormous abundance that people are paid not to produce. My brother is a farmer in Austria and his farm produces absolutely nothing. And the reason his farm produces nothing is not because he\u2019s a stupid black man but because the government pays him to produce nothing. And all over Europe, we have butter mountains and beef mountains and wine lakes and milk lakes and cheese mountains that are preserved and maintained, kept away from the market so that we can maintain market prices at the same time as we are paying for the preservation of these goods, agricultural goods. And the whole thing is a complete mess when you look at it globally. This is not any sensible way to run the world. And it\u2019s an ethical mess, as well, which\u2026 It\u2019s an ethical mess as well as practical mess. You know, on the one hand, people are starving; on the other hand, we\u2019re keeping goods out of the market because you want to maintain prices. And the effect of listening to that litany of madness, as you describe it which, you know, those are statistics that bombard us in newspaper accounts and documentaries. And the effect on me, and I think the effect on many people, is simply to throw up my hands and say, \u201CThese problems are so large, the structures are so complex, how can that ever possibly change?\u201D You know, people are discussing what we can do about the monetary system because the monetary system that we have at the moment is purely a fiat by decree. And what does that have to do with these huge inequities that you talked about and this gap between supply and demand \u2014 people starving on the one hand and huge stockpiles on the other? What it has to do is the following: As long as we have a money system that is based on fiat \u2014 that means simply a government\u2019s say-so, a government can just create any amount of money that it wants to at any given moment without anything necessarily backing that promise \u2014 then we can create a system in which there are global booms and busts which are outside our control. This is too complicated to explain very simply. But let\u2019s say there is demand for computers today. And if there is a market demand for computers, every single computer manufacturer gears up to produce more and more computers. But at some time, for whatever reason, the demand in computers slacks off, for whatever reason. Then suddenly there\u2019s a glut in the market of computers that are being produced by all these different manufacturers. Now, why do computer manufacturers set up all these factories? How are they able to set up all these factories? Well, they\u2019re able to set up all these factories because they can borrow money on the basis of what they perceive to be and what they can present to their bankers as being more or less guaranteed demand. And, of course, if the money\u2019s lent to them, the factories can be set up and, of course, this business goes on. So because of having a currency that is based on fiat, we are much more able to generate production at a rate that is uncontrolled. And markets control things then by going into a bust when there is too much supply in the market. Am I making sense? Yes, you are. So, you know, I\u2019m very interested if you can, tell me how change could happen, where change could happen. I mean, what do you see? Are other people like you, in positions like you, asking these questions? Are people pursuing these questions? Oh, yes, indeed. These kinds of questions are big questions, and people are discussing them and debating them. And we can inform ourselves about the debate; that\u2019s one thing we can do. And, secondly, having informed ourselves about these kinds of issues, we can begin to ask our representatives in parliament or in Senate or in the House of Representatives where they stand and how they see these issues. The third thing is to do what you can. Now, you and I cannot do anything about the world financial system or the world monetary system, but what we can do is take action in our locality and with our people. And one of the great things about the United States is that wherever I travel I see small groups of people who are committed to doing things to make a difference, whether it\u2019s students in school \u2014 I\u2019m talking of, you know, really children in school \u2014 or whether it\u2019s retired people, seniors, or whether it\u2019s people who are working in companies in mid-level or top-level jobs, doesn\u2019t really matter. But find something that you are passionate about which is going to make a difference in the world and put your shoulder behind it, because there\u2019re so many issues that one can put one\u2019s shoulder behind, whether it\u2019s conservation-related issues to look after the environment, whether it\u2019s poverty in our own communities. I mean, the United States has 12 million people who are poor, which is about a tenth of the U.S. population in very round figures. So there\u2019s a lot to do just in the States in terms of eliminating poverty, let alone eliminating poverty and helping poor people in other parts of the world. And then there are political actions you can take to support things that can help. I mean, for example, what\u2019s happening in Sudan at the moment is something that was known about for ages, but the U.S. government, for example, did not take a strong line on what was happening in Sudan till groups of people in the U.S. started taking Sudan seriously, started lobbying the government and saying, \u201CHey, you\u2019ve got to pay attention to this issue.\u201D And if each of us do our part, as many people are doing their part, more than we think, then the world can be cleaned up. I mean, I think of Transparency International, which is helping to clean up the business of corruption worldwide \u2014 one man\u2019s vision. One man working for a multinational in Africa got fed up of seeing the extent of corruption around him, determined that he would help to clean up corruption worldwide. And Transparency International has now got to the level of nearly \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly what the situation is today \u2014 but we\u2019re at the point of outlawing corruption in business worldwide all because of one man\u2019s work over, I don\u2019t know, 20 years, 15 years, something like that. Prabhu Guptara of the Union Bank of Switzerland, UBS. Until fairly recently, corruption was a widely tolerated norm in economies across the world. Even Western businesses, which would not condone open corruption in their own cultures, have, at times, integrated practices such as bribery into their dealings with developing economies. In doing so, they have sustained and fueled such practices. Transparency International, which Prabhu Guptara mentioned, was founded in 1993 and now has chapters in over 80 countries. This organization doesn\u2019t expose individual cases of corruption; it works instead at the national and international levels to curb both the supply and the demand of corruption. This is Speaking of Faith. After a short break, more of Prabhu Guptara on differences in attitudes towards business in religiously active America and religiously agnostic Europe. Also, how Enron and other U.S. corporate scandals might be affecting global practices. This exploration continues at speakingoffaith.org.

Speaking of Faith comes to you from American Public Media. Welcome back to Speaking of Faith, public radio\u2019s conversation about religion, meaning, ethics and ideas. I\u2019m Krista Tippett. Today, \u201CThe Gods of Business.\u201D As former Enron executives come to trial in Houston, I\u2019m speaking with Prabhu Guptara. He directs executive and organizational development programs for UBS of Switzerland, one of the world\u2019s largest banks. He also travels and lectures around the world about issues at the intersection of business, religion and ethics. We\u2019ve been talking about how religious traditions influence corporate morality from the office to macroeconomics. Guptara insists that as the global economy grows there is a compelling need for individuals to assert personal ethics and moral values in the world of business. Europeans observe with fascination and some puzzlement that the United States is the most religiously active society in the developed world. The US has the highest number of people who go to church on the face of the Earth. About 70 percent of people say they believe in God, 40 percent go to church every Sunday. Now, this is, you know, quite extraordinary, because in Europe \u2014 in Switzerland, where I sit \u2014 and in Europe, 1 percent of the population goes to church every Sunday. Although I\u2019m interested in this way in which you describe that it\u2019s not necessarily a straight line between being religious and being ethical in business. And one thing you point out is that, for example, whereas business is regulated by law and business ethics also are regulated by law in the United States, let\u2019s say in Europe it\u2019s more in terms of principles. And I wonder if, even though, as you say, only 1 percent of Europeans go to church, whether having a sense of principles might lead in general to more ethical practices. Sure, but it depends on what the principles are. I mean, Hitler had principles. Mao had principles. Osama bin Laden has principles. And this, of course, is extremely politically incorrect in the States at the moment to start discussing what principles people have and whether they\u2019re OK principles or not OK principles. Nevertheless, that is the debate that we need to have. You know, what are civilized principles, say, human principles and what are noncivilized or nonhuman principles that, you know, we will not accept in a global system? Let me ask a question this way. As you travel and do business and observe business all over the world, what are some of the guidelines or tests you would apply? What principles work for the good of people and of society? On the one hand, there are societies where the individual matters not a bit. China, Japan \u2014 traditionally, I\u2019m saying, traditionally \u2014 India, the Middle East, Africa or pre-Reformation Europe are all examples of societies where the individual didn\u2019t count. Society counted, the community counted, but the individual didn\u2019t count. So in those kinds of oppressive societies, the issue is how do we open those societies up so that individuals can be individuals? In the West, of course, and in Europe, you\u2019ve got the opposite problem at the moment. You\u2019ve got so much individualism that it becomes destructive of society. And so the issue is, how can you encourage individuals to take individual decisions, but at the same time to take individual decisions that enable them to take responsibility for society and not destroy society? The other criterion is does it improve the life of \u2014 I mean at the material level \u2014 does it improve the life for most individuals on the Earth or does it improve the material well-being of only a few people on the Earth? And the third is, as we improve the level of material well-being of individuals on the Earth, are we doing it in such a way that we are storing up huge problems for the future? So my key word would be \u201Cresponsibility.\u201D I wonder if you have any stories you could tell me of particular businesses or cultures or localities where people are really working to achieve that kind of balance that you described? Yeah. I\u2019ll give you a very small example. I work, as I said, for one of the world\u2019s largest banks or, as you said, for one of the world\u2019s largest banks, which is true. And if you go back 20 years, we had a reputation here in Switzerland for being the center for the world\u2019s dirty money. And I\u2019m sure in some parts of the world we still have that reputation. But 15 or 20 years ago Switzerland began to really clamp down and make a determined effort to keep dirty money out of Switzerland. Now, though that started a long time ago and has made an impact gradually and slowly over the whole of the industry, the public perception didn\u2019t seem to have changed a lot. And so one of my colleagues took his reputation in his hands, went to our chief executive and said, \u201CWe need to be doing something about this so that we can actually change not just our own practices, which we\u2019ve been doing gradually over the last 15, 20 years, but change practices in the entire industry. I mean, if we don\u2019t take dirty money but somebody else is taking dirty money, well, that\u2019s all very well for us but it doesn\u2019t sort the situation out globally. And it\u2019s very bad for us because it means competitively we\u2019re losing out because our competitors are getting the dirty money and we\u2019re not getting the dirty money. That doesn\u2019t do us any good in the marketplace because they\u2019re being more successful than we are.\u201D And so we brought together 12 of the world\u2019s largest banks \u2014 private banks, wealth managers \u2014 and put in place industry standards that the 12 largest banks were willing to stand by. And this group, which is called the Wolfsberg Group, put in place the anti-money laundering principles that were already practiced in most of these banks \u2014 perhaps in all these banks, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but articulated them for the first time and made them an industry standard. And today, I don\u2019t know, about 100 banks are very keen to adopt these anti-money laundering principles, and more banks will, no doubt, follow. Now I come to September the 11th. When September the 11th happened and the U.S. government asked all the major banks in the world to provide facts and figures about, you know, where money might have been coming in to support terrorism from, there were very few banks worldwide that were able to produce the facts and figures very quickly, and our bank was one of them. And the reason we were able to do that was because of my colleague\u2019s work in the whole anti-money laundering area. So individuals can make a difference, individuals do make a difference, and individuals can make a much bigger impact than they think of and they dream of if they\u2019re willing to take their responsibility seriously. I think of this dear lady, whom I\u2019ve never met, whom I don\u2019t know, who exposed the whole of the Enron scandal. It was one woman. So individuals have enormous power. And we are fed consistently, somehow, by our culture the devil\u2019s lie that we have no power and it\u2019s only poor old me. Yes, it is only poor old me. But poor old me, poor old I have enormous power if I\u2019m willing to keep my eyes open and keep my ears open and act at the right time when it\u2019s necessary to act to clean things up or to improve things. Things may be perfectly clean, but they could be improved a bit. So individuals with vision, that\u2019s what we lack. Business analyst and educator Prabhu Guptara. He is Indian-born and a practicing Hindu. He works in Switzerland and consults in the United States and the rest of the world. Corporate scandals have engendered cynicism about business ethics in many Americans. I asked Prabhu Guptara how he interprets the discrepancy between America\u2019s religious and moral ideals and high-profile corruption. I can\u2019t see how you are going to create a culture in which ethical and moral standards are going to be maintained. You are still living on the basis of inherited moral capital that came down to you from the great figures of U.S. history who transformed America from being a frontier civilization to being a settled civilization. Now, America\u2019s going through this so-called culture war between people who are committed to some transcendent value \u2014 you can call it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, doesn\u2019t matter what it is \u2014 but who are committed to some kind of transcendent value on the one hand and on the other hand people who are not. But are you saying that there is a moral foundation in other cultures that in America has been lost? You see, Europe is an old society. Europe is a settled society in the same way that India is a settled society or China is a settled society. And what happens is, if you don\u2019t have religion, which many people here do not, as we\u2019ve discussed, you still have society. You still have very close family. Well, in the little village in which I live, population 10,000, most people were born in that village, have lived in that village and will die in that village. Most people went to school with a group of people who are still their friends. Most people are still living in houses not very far away from their grandparents. So grandparents, parents and children are within walking distance of each other. And even when people go as far as Australia or the States \u2014 of course, some people immigrate. That\u2019s different. But if they come back, they won\u2019t come back and settle down, let\u2019s say, three hours\u2019 drive from their grandparents, they\u2019ll come and settle down usually within a 20-minute drive at the most of their parents or their grandparents. So it\u2019s a very settled society, and this settled society means that traditional ethics are still extremely important. People know each other very well, and, as a result of knowing each other very well in a settled society, you can cheat somebody once but you won\u2019t be able to cheat somebody twice or thrice, unlike the U.S., which is a highly mobile society where people can be individually religious, but they have no social bonds around them to keep them, you know, within moral limits. So if their individual ethics keeps them within moral limits, fine. But if the individual ethics does not keep them within moral limits, there\u2019s nothing else to keep them within the moral limits. OK. So you\u2019re saying that in the United States, in fact, it is more critical that, you said, that there are some kinds of transcendent values that individuals, in fact, hold? Right. Right. OK, interesting. Well, you were getting ready to talk to me about, then, what the implications of this loss of transcendent values in the United States means. What does Enron really say about business today? Or is it really about business in America? Or is it really about American culture more than anything else? I guess it\u2019s a statement about all of those things at some level because business is ultimately about trust. It doesn\u2019t matter how many rules you have, how many regulations you have and how many systems and processes you have. At the end of the day, you cannot go around policing each of your employees to make sure that they\u2019re not defrauding you, they are not cheating, they\u2019re not lying and all the rest of it. And I think the United States is very rapidly coming to a situation where you cannot naturally trust people any longer. Essentially \u2014 whatever you may say about Enron and Arthur Andersen and all the rest of it \u2014 essentially it was a result of the inability to police people at the top because people at the top were not policing themselves and there was nobody around to police them. Because traditionally, people have been policed from the inside by themselves and not by others in your society in the United States. And, as this business of people\u2019s consciences begins to break down, people\u2019s ability to understand and make ethical decisions breaks down, it becomes much more difficult to build world-class businesses. Because that trust would also be lost on the part of other global business leaders vis-\u00E0-vis American companies? You\u2019re right. I mean, you see, America has become such a legalistic society now that there are businesses that are seriously thinking \u201CIs it worth doing business in the United States?\u201D And the reason is, when I do business with a colleague here in Europe, generally speaking we reach a gentlemen\u2019s agreement and that\u2019s that. If we need to bring in contracts and lawyers, OK, we bring in contracts and lawyers. And obviously at some point, somebody needs to sort the whole thing out legally and put it all down in black and white. But that\u2019s not the basis on which the business is done. The business is done on the basis I look you in the eye and I say, \u201CThis is the deal. Right?\u201D And the person says, \u201CRight. I agree.\u201D And you shake hands on it, and that\u2019s the deal. That\u2019s the way business is done. Now, in the U.S., you know all about the army of lawyers that\u2019s needed before you can do any deal at all. And, of course, as American business practices have been exported around the world, more and more legalistic systems have come in. And that has its positive side, of course, when you get into large, complex deals because you need to know exactly what you\u2019re contracting to do or not do, or pay or not pay, and when, to what quality, and all the rest of it. But there is really a sort of overkill at the moment on the legalistic system\u2019s procedures end without looking at, hey, are we going to be able to sustain businesses if we carry on down this path? Or do we need to revisit the issue of how do we build trust, how do we build character in individuals? How do we create business cultures that are ethical? And if you don\u2019t revisit those internal realities that are really what produced the greatness of the West as against the East, then the West is going to go down. And if you\u2019re going to have essentially an unethical society in which you cannot trust people, not even your own employees and not even your own bosses, to do the right thing, then you will not be able to continue to be a prosperous society. I mean, it\u2019s just as simple as that. Prabhu Guptara of the Swiss banking concern UBS. I\u2019m Krista Tippett, and this is Speaking of Faith from American Public Media. Today, \u201CThe Gods of Business.\u201D Prabhu Guptara has told me how best practices in business worldwide were largely formed by practical values drawn from Judaism and Christianity. And in recent history, he says, these values were most powerfully embodied in American corporations. I asked him if, with scandals like Enron, that is seen to be changing. I think Americans have a sense of our economy being so huge and our business leading the world that it\u2019s hard to imagine that, rather than America being shut out of international business, whatever the problems are, that the American ethical cultures would, in fact, infuse the rest of the world\u2019s business. That\u2019s certainly been the case till today that \u2014 you know, even till today this is the case. And it\u2019s only begun to be reversed from about Enron onwards that people are saying, \u201CHey, if America\u2019s like this, you know, do we really want American business practices?\u201D And that\u2019s still a marginal issue; it\u2019s not a big issue. But, you know, it could become big if things continue along that path, and hopefully they won\u2019t continue along that path. But that is a danger. Yeah, tell me about those conversations. Are there practical things you can point to that changed with Enron in terms of the attitude and behavior of businesses in other countries towards American business? Well, if you look back to about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, America was the first country to bring in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. And the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act essentially tried \u2014 OK, not totally effectively \u2014 but it tried to outlaw the practice of bribery, and it was the first country to bring that in. Europe and the rest of the world only began to move as a result of the repeated hammering of organizations like Transparency International, which I\u2019ve referred to earlier. So America was seen as some kind of moral exemplar, as some kind of moral leader in business. And, essentially, European businesses and other businesses didn\u2019t like the American approach but had to conform to the American approach if they wanted to do business in America. So the issue was America was perceived as being a moral leader in a way that a lot of world businesses didn\u2019t like, but because America was such a dominant power in business and was trying to be ethical, at least more ethical than the rest of the world, it was perceived as being moral. Now what happened is that this so-called moralistic business system coming out of the U.S. is suddenly perceived to be hollow as a result of Enron and Arthur Andersen and all the rest of it going down. And people start saying, \u201CWell, you know, we are not as hypocritical as the Americans are because at least we don\u2019t pretend to be moral. The Americans pretend to be moral, and then look what they\u2019re like, really.\u201D So what happened was that a whole thrust in terms of cleaning up world business lost steam as a result of Enron, on the one hand, and legalistic methods to try to make sure that people were ticking boxes and keeping to those rules have begun to come in instead. You know, when people talk about business ethics in the United States, we\u2019re generally talking about workplace cultures, employee ethics. Sure. And this is putting the whole issue on a much larger ground. We haven\u2019t been talking about religion at all. In fact, it\u2019s been mentioned that very religious people can be very corrupt in business, and people who are atheists can be very moral in business. You know, what does religion have to do with business ethics at this global level, if anything? It is an issue because the question is where will we get a global business ethic from? Historically, as I said, the ethical practices in business have come out of Judaism and Christianity. That doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily need to come out only from that. They could come out from Islam, they could come out from Buddhism, they could come out from\u2026 Well, and you\u2019re Hindu. I mean, yeah. I\u2019m a Hindu, sure. Yes. The question is where are the people who will take on the challenge of creating that kind of a global business ethic and actually then implement it? And there are people who are trying to do that, but they are, at present, few and far between, and the initiatives are fragmentary and not as well-supported as they probably should be. If you look at things like the Global Compact, which has been started by the United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, and which now brings together some of the world\u2019s largest businesses, they\u2019re trying to take seriously this whole issue of what does it mean to be good citizen as a company of the world? And that is one kind of level at which you can operate. Another kind of level at which you can operate is training the next generation of leaders inside companies, not at some kind of global level, but inside companies. And a third level, obviously, is the level of the training that we give to our children in schools or in homes. And each of us, depending on whether we are parents or godfathers or godmothers or whatever of children, or by our actions in companies and in society, create this kind of global ethic or don\u2019t. And the question I think that I would like to leave us with in terms of religion and ethics is where does my religious or transcendent orientation, whatever that might be, where and how does that relate first to my individual ethics, to my group ethics in terms of the way my company operates, and then to global business ethics? And I think if more of us asked ourselves that question, we could begin to work out the answers quite satisfactorily. My problem is that most people don\u2019t think about it and, when they begin to think about it, realize how ignorant they are of what their own religious tradition is supposed to be, whether it\u2019s Christian or Muslim or Jewish or whatever it happens to be. But if you look inside your own religious tradition, whatever that is, you\u2019ll find whether that religious tradition is adequate in terms of helping you as an individual to live out ethical values individually and whether it\u2019s adequate in terms of living out your ethical values inside your company or organization that you work for or in your community and whether it\u2019s helping you to look at the big global issues like conservation and nature and poverty and all the rest of it. The U.S. is the picture of the future, isn\u2019t it? And if you look at Europe, Europe is being steadily Americanized. If we look at India, India is being steadily Americanized. If we look at China, China is being steadily Americanized. We are all going in the direction of greater individualism, greater fragmentation of society, greater mobility, greater individualism in a negative sense individualism, though, of course, individualism is also positive, as we discussed earlier. So throughout the world, we see this Americanization taking place. The elite throughout the world define themselves as being pro-American or anti-American, whether it\u2019s in terms of business practice, politics, sport, Coca-Cola or whatever else. And this why the culture clash that is taking place, the culture war that is taking place in the U.S. is so significant for the globe, not just for the U.S. It will determine the direction in which the elite throughout the world move. Prabhu Guptara is director of executive and organizational development at the Wolfsberg Center of UBS in Zurich, Switzerland. Prabhu Guptara names truths that are elemental yet rarely discussed. For example, that there is a transnational human tendency to set private ethics and religious values aside in the marketplace. In a highly mobile, individualistic society like the 21st-century United States, this creates corporate citizens with no binding sense of accountability. We\u2019ve raised a generation of leaders who seem to require policing from the outside. This insight illuminates the human roots of an Enron scandal more incisively than many other complicated analyses. Prabhu Guptara has a broad, global view, but his conclusions would challenge each of us. If we don\u2019t want to sustain and export the ways of Enron, he says, we must all exercise conscience at work, whether we find it in religious or other kinds of ethical sources. Here, in closing, is a reading from a 2002 speech Prabhu Guptara delivered to a business seminar in Cambridge, England. Positive steps can be taken to ensure a good future for us all. It seems to me clear that the following steps would give us some sort of minimum agenda for creating a better sort of globalization: inculcate a culture in which there is a high place for the idea of enough self-restrain or penalize demands for higher wages and profits move away from a fascination with economic expansion for its own sake replace the notion of private limited companies with publicly authorized companies, which take seriously the environment, labor, consumers and civil society. We need a new generation of people willing to be transformed as individuals, willing to create a new sense of community, ready to pay the cost of working for the continued transformation of our global society, and of transforming our companies from engines to make even richer those who are already rich to engines that work to produce wealth for the globe.
